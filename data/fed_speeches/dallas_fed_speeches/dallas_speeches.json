            "content": "Thank you, Diana [Hancock]. It’s great to be at this important annual gathering and have the opportunity to discuss the policy outlook with you, Viral [Acharya] and Markus [Brunnermeier]. I’ll begin with some thoughts on the state of the economy and monetary policy and then turn more specifically to the Fed’s balance sheet and how we are implementing policy in money markets. As always, the views I express are mine and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nAs we look back over the past year, inflation today is in a much better place than last January. But the job of restoring price stability is not yet complete. Our challenge now is to finish the work of bringing inflation sustainably back to the 2 percent target.\n\nInflation data have generally been coming in cooler than expected, which is good news. The price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) was nearly flat for November and up 2.6 percent over the past year. The Dallas Fed trimmed mean PCE inflation rate, which drops outliers, is 2.6 percent for the past three and six months. And core PCE increased at only around a 2 percent pace over the past three and six months, an improvement from the middle of 2023 when inflation appeared to be getting stuck at a higher level.\n\nAnd there’s clear evidence that the economy is moving into better balance. While GDP grew at an unsustainably strong 4.9 percent annual rate in the third quarter, preliminary readings suggest the fourth quarter will be substantially slower. My business and community contacts consistently report that growth is settling down—not collapsing, not heading toward recession, but settling down.\n\nThe labor market, while still tight, also continues to rebalance. The pace of payroll job gains over the past several months has remained strong but is well below the pace at the start of 2023. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has fallen, as has the rate of workers quitting their jobs. And wage growth appears to be somewhat more consistent with our 2 percent inflation target. Contacts tell me that applicant pools are growing, and job candidates’ salary expectations are moderating. This is a more consistent picture than we had earlier in 2023. It gives me confidence that we have made a lot of progress toward a more sustainable path for the economy.\n\nSo, what could derail this benign outlook of inflation returning sustainably to our target as the economy gradually rebalances? There are, as always, plenty of risks: geopolitical threats to supply chains, financial fragilities in sectors such as commercial real estate and just the simple possibility that our forecasts are once again wrong, as they’ve been too many times in recent years. A key risk related to the topic of this panel is that a premature easing of financial conditions could allow demand to pick back up. Restrictive financial conditions have played an important role in bringing demand into line with supply and keeping inflation expectations well-anchored. Yet over the past few months, long-term yields have given back most of the tightening that we saw over the summer. We can’t count on sustaining price stability if we don’t maintain sufficiently restrictive financial conditions.\n\nMuch of the easing in long-term yields since October came in response to softer economic data or policy communications. Ordinarily, that pattern would suggest that markets expect the FOMC won’t need as restrictive a setting of the federal funds rate to accomplish our goals. But the magnitude of the reactions to data was much greater than normal. Part of what appears to be happening is that when the data are strong, as occurred over the summer, market participants perceive a wider range of potential rate outcomes and require compensation for that risk in the form of higher term premiums. And when the data soften, as happened recently, that term premium comes out because market participants perceive more of an upper bound on policy rates. Some model-based term premium estimates remain higher than levels seen last summer, but I’m mindful that all else equal, a lower term premium leaves more work to be done with the fed funds target.\n\nFinancial conditions indexes (FCIs) can provide a guide to how much restraint there is on the economy. I’ll talk today about four indexes that I find particularly informative. Three of the indexes are helpful because they weight financial variables based on their relationship to economic activity in macroeconomic models. These are the Goldman Sachs FCI and two FCIs published by the staff of the Federal Reserve Board: a baseline index that allows financial conditions to affect the economy with a lag of up to three years and an alternate index that allows lags of at most one year. The fourth index, published by the Chicago Fed, is more statistical in nature and doesn’t translate directly to an effect on economic activity, but it includes a much wider range of financial variables.\n\nThe Board staff’s baseline index shows a drag on GDP growth from tight financial conditions in the coming year. But that’s because the index assumes long lags. My staff produced an updated calculation of the Board staff’s alternative index with one-year lags, and it shows a tailwind to growth. The Goldman Sachs FCI shows something similar. My own view is that the right answer is somewhere in between. These indexes include only a subset of asset prices. Looking across the financial system as a whole, we’re still seeing tightening from bank credit and refinancing of term corporate debt. But a lot of the effects of higher rates are already behind us, and the recent easing in conditions could start to push up on aggregate demand. The Chicago Fed’s FCI, which statistically combines 105 different financial variables, shows that conditions are modestly less restrictive than a year ago and than their average over the past half century.\n\nAs I said earlier, if we don’t maintain sufficiently tight financial conditions, there is a risk that inflation will pick back up and reverse the progress we’ve made. In light of the easing in financial conditions in recent months, we shouldn’t take the possibility of another rate increase off the table just yet.\n\nTurning to the Fed’s balance sheet and policy implementation, we have reduced our securities holdings since mid-2022 at a brisk pace consistent with the principles and plans that the FOMC announced earlier that year. While securities holdings have declined by $1.3 trillion, bank reserve balances have actually risen by $350 billion dollars to around $3.5 trillion. That’s because reduced balances in the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility have more than offset the decline in securities holdings. Increased Treasury issuance and a less uncertain interest rate path have contributed to the rapid ON RRP runoff by motivating money market funds to invest more in Treasury bills.\n\nMoney markets and policy implementation are continuing to function smoothly. As we did in 2018 and early 2019, we are likely to see modest, temporary rate pressures as our balance sheet shrinks and our liabilities redistribute. These rate pressures can be a price signal that helps market participants redistribute liquidity to the places where it’s needed. Experience shows that these pressures tend to emerge first on dates when liquidity is unusually encumbered or is draining out of the system especially rapidly, like tax-payment dates, Treasury settlements and month-ends. And indeed, we saw small, temporary rises in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) over the November–December and year-end turns. But on nearly all days, broad money market rates have remained well below the interest rate on reserves.\n\nThe emergence of typical month-end pressures suggests we’re no longer in a regime where liquidity is super abundant and always in excess supply for everyone. In the aggregate, though, as rate conditions demonstrate, the financial system almost certainly still has more than ample bank reserves and more than ample liquidity overall. The most recent Senior Financial Officer Survey shows that most banks in the sample have reserves well in excess of their lowest comfortable levels and desired buffers. ON RRP balances remain around $700 billion. And the Federal Reserve’s Standing Repo Facility (SRF) provides a backstop against any unexpected pressures.\n\nStill, individual banks can approach scarcity before the system as a whole. In this environment, the system needs to redistribute liquidity from the institutions that happen to have it to those that need it most. The faster our balance sheet shrinks, the faster that redistribution needs to happen. I’d note that the current pace of asset runoff is around twice what it was in the first half of 2019. And while the current level of ON RRP balances provides comfort that liquidity is ample in aggregate, there will be more uncertainty about aggregate liquidity conditions as ON RRP balances approach zero.\n\nSo, given the rapid decline of the ON RRP, I think it’s appropriate to consider the parameters that will guide a decision to slow the runoff of our assets. In my view, we should slow the pace of runoff as ON RRP balances approach a low level. Normalizing the balance sheet more slowly can actually help get to a more efficient balance sheet in the long run by smoothing redistribution and reducing the likelihood that we’d have to stop prematurely.\n\nLastly, I want to take note of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s adoption last month of a requirement for broader central clearing for cash and repo transactions in the Treasury market. While broader central clearing won’t cure all of the market’s vulnerabilities, our research at the Dallas Fed finds that it will have significant benefits. Related to my previous comments, broader central clearing should make repo markets more elastic as multilateral netting can reduce intermediaries’ balance sheet costs. That will help smooth the redistribution of liquidity when balance sheets are constrained, such as during stress episodes and at period ends. Broader central clearing should also meaningfully improve risk management, in particular by mitigating risks at interdealer brokers in the cash market and by addressing the 74 percent of noncentrally cleared bilateral repos that are currently transacted with zero haircuts. Of course, careful implementation by the industry and regulators will be important. The SEC has established a phased timeline, with full compliance in 2026. As the market moves toward broader clearing, I think the FOMC should also consider the benefits of central clearing of the Federal Reserve’s own Treasury market operations. The SEC regulation exempts central banks, but in my view, it’s typically most efficient and effective for us to operate in the same way as the main market participants. And, as I’ve discussed previously, central clearing of the SRF could make that facility more effective in providing backstop liquidity to the broad market.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "I’m grateful to Anil Kashyap for inviting me to participate in this U.S. Monetary Policy Forum and to discuss this year’s paper by a distinguished set of authors on a very timely topic. The paper assesses the recent experience with quantitative tightening (QT) across seven advanced economies. After cataloging central banks’ QT strategies, the paper assesses the effects of QT on asset markets and money markets across several dimensions—including prices, liquidity and portfolio holdings of different types of market participants. There’s a wealth of valuable information here. I highly recommend reading the entire paper.\n\nI’ll focus on a few aspects that I see as particularly relevant to policy decisions facing the Federal Reserve in coming months and years. As always, these remarks represent my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nA central theme of the paper is that the effects of quantitative easing (QE) and QT appear asymmetric. For example, while QT announcements tend to increase government bond yields, the effect as measured in this paper is significantly smaller in magnitude than the typical decrease in yields associated with QE announcements. And while large-scale asset purchases have at times contributed to dramatic improvements in market functioning during stress episodes, QT episodes do not appear to have significantly reduced the liquidity of government bonds.\n\nThe paper mainly emphasizes an asymmetry in magnitude: by and large, the effects of QE as measured in the simple framework of this paper are notably larger than those of QT. This finding aligns with my own perspective on what we’ve seen in markets. Today, I’ll lay out the framework that I use to think about the effects of QE and QT. I’ll then draw on that framework to consider why the magnitudes of QE and QT effects as measured here are so different and how what we measure relates to the underlying mechanisms. Finally, I’ll turn to a second asymmetry, between effects on asset markets and funding markets, that’s important for understanding the path forward on QT in the United States.\n\nResearch and practical experience suggest that changes in central bank asset holdings influence financial conditions through a variety of mechanisms. For purposes of today’s discussion, I’ll categorize those mechanisms into three broad channels: portfolio balance, signaling and liquidity.[1] For each channel, we can distinguish announcement effects, which happen when the central bank communicates a plan to change its asset holdings, from implementation effects, which happen when the asset holdings actually change.\n\nWhen the central bank holds more of a given asset, private sector portfolios hold less of that asset, all else equal. To the extent that assets are not perfect substitutes, for example because they embody different risks or serve different purposes in investors’ portfolios, asset prices must move to induce private sector investors to change their holdings. The most prominent example of this portfolio balance channel is the duration risk effect. If the central bank holds more duration risk by acquiring long-term securities, term premiums are likely to fall, all else equal. Conversely, if the central bank reduces its holdings of duration risk, term premiums are likely to rise. Because financial markets are forward looking, the portfolio-balance channel operates mostly through announcement effects, as formal statements or informal communications shift market expectations about upcoming changes in the central bank’s assets. However, the portfolio-balance channel can also have implementation effects, as prices may adjust when the central bank actually changes its holdings to induce market participants to change their holdings at that time.\n\nSecond is the signaling channel, which fundamentally operates through announcement effects. For instance, when the policy rate is at the effective lower bound (ELB), a central bank’s plans to buy assets can send a signal that policymakers intend to keep the policy rate at the lower bound for some time. This signal can reinforce other forward guidance and move market expectations of the policy rate path.\n\nFinally, the liquidity channel refers to the effect of the central bank’s transactions on trading conditions in the asset market and the resulting liquidity risk premia. The liquidity channel can narrowly affect the specific securities the central bank acquires or sells, or it can affect a broader set of securities if these transactions change general pressures on intermediaries. Although the liquidity channel often operates through implementation effects, a central bank’s purchase plans can also reassure market participants and support market liquidity upon announcement, as we observed, for example, with the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility.[2]\n\nDistinguishing these channels is helpful in making sense of the asymmetric magnitudes of measured QE and QT effects.\n\nAt first glance, the asymmetry could seem puzzling. If it’s true, as the paper says, that the effects of QT are “far less than simply reversing the effects of quantitative easing,” doesn’t that violate some kind of law of nature? What if what goes up does not come down? Could cycles of QE and QT be some kind of economic perpetual motion machine?\n\nBut the puzzle goes away when we recognize that any empirical study of the effects of QE or QT faces two fundamental challenges.\n\nThe first challenge arises because financial markets are forward looking. It’s difficult to measure the effect of a well-anticipated policy action. Mostly, what we can measure is the effect of unanticipated actions. And, as the paper acknowledges, QT tends to be much better anticipated than QE, in part because central banks tend to telegraph that QE is temporary.\n\nImagine a hypothetical central bank that announced it would buy assets at a fixed monthly pace for two years and then allow those assets to mature without reinvesting, and that it would not reconsider this plan under any circumstances. Term premiums would move when the central bank made this announcement, reflecting market anticipation of the entire path of asset purchases and maturities. If the central bank then happened to announce at the two-year mark that purchases had ended and runoff had begun, that “QT” announcement would convey no new information and, as an announcement, should have no effect on term premiums. Nevertheless, in this hypothetical program, QT would eventually fully unwind the term premium effects of QE. Part of the unwind would actually happen up front: the effect of the QE announcement would be dampened by the certainty that assets would start to run off in two years. The QE announcement would contain the seeds of its own undoing. And the rest of the unwind would happen gradually as the assets ran off and market prices shifted to accommodate larger private sector holdings.\n\nOf course, real-world QT isn’t preplanned in such a rigid way, but its onset still tends to be better anticipated than QE. QT typically starts when the economic recovery is clearly underway and usually isn’t a big surprise. In the current cycle, the Bank of England even provided a nearly mechanical rule relating the start of QT to the policy rate.[3]\n\nBy contrast, central banks typically launch QE in unusual circumstances—an economic crisis or financial stress episode when adjusting the policy rate isn’t adequate or isn’t possible. I don’t like to call QE “unconventional” policy because it’s now a firmly established part of the central bank toolkit. Nevertheless, QE is used infrequently enough and in unusual-enough circumstances that there is no simple and predictable pattern to how it’s used. Even when market participants expect a central bank to deploy QE in some form, they typically have a broadly dispersed distribution of expectations about the size and timing of the program. QE announcements collapse that uncertainty. Thus, the measured effect of QE announcements tends to be larger than the measured effect of the widely anticipated onset of QT.\n\nThis brings me to the second challenge facing studies like today’s and the second explanation for the asymmetry in magnitudes: QE and QT are the result of central banks’ deliberate policy choices. Central banks deploy QE when they believe QE will have desirable effects and QT when they believe QT will have desirable effects. The circumstances are different, and intentionally so.\n\nCentral banks usually launch QE programs when markets are under severe stress or policy rates are at the ELB. By contrast, QT announcements typically come when markets are calm and policy rates are above the lower bound. The liquidity channel operates very differently in these two types of environments, and to some degree, so do the signaling and portfolio-balance channels. In other words, the asymmetry in measured effects is at least partly an asymmetry in the contexts where QE and QT are announced—not simply an asymmetry in the effects that QE and QT would have if they were counterfactually announced in identical contexts.[4]\n\nIt’s easiest to see the asymmetry across environments in the case of the liquidity channel. Some programs under the broad umbrella of QE have specifically aimed to address dysfunction in asset markets. Consider, for example, the Fed’s purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) during our first QE program amid the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) or our historically large and rapid purchases of Treasury securities and MBS at the onset of the pandemic. In the stressed trading conditions that prevailed at the start of both of these episodes, the Fed’s purchases restored normal market liquidity. I suspect that if a central bank were to announce QT during a severe stress episode, the liquidity effects would be at least as large as those usually observed for QE (though with the opposite sign). But since central banks generally wait to initiate QT until the underlying sources of market dysfunction have been mitigated, QT doesn’t typically trigger new rounds of dysfunction that would reverse the liquidity gains from QE.[5] To summarize, the main reason we measure larger liquidity effects on average from QE than QT is because central banks don’t use QT when it would have large liquidity effects.\n\nThe asymmetry across environments also applies, to a degree, to the signaling and portfolio-balance channels. Forward guidance about the policy rate becomes more important when the policy rate is at the lower bound and can’t be lowered further. Correspondingly, the signaling channel’s ability to reinforce forward guidance is more powerful at the lower bound. Additionally, central banks often state explicitly that QT actions convey no signal about the future path of the policy rate, being motivated instead by a desire to normalize the balance sheet.[6]\n\nAs for the portfolio-balance channel, remember that the term premium is the compensation investors require to bear duration risk. All else equal, that compensation is higher when there is more uncertainty about future interest rates. This implies central bank asset holdings are likely to have a larger effect on term premiums at times of relatively higher interest rate uncertainty. The key question is when those times are, and in contrast to the asymmetry that the conference paper emphasizes, research has found that such times often include the start of QT. That may be because QT tends to occur when rates are away from the ELB and front-end rate volatility is mechanically higher.[7] But measuring these effects can require controlling in a detailed way for interest rate uncertainty and the magnitude of the surprise in a central bank’s QE or QT announcement, which could be challenging in a broad cross-country analysis of the type the conference paper undertakes.[8]\n\nUnpacking the asymmetry that the paper describes goes some way toward understanding why QE is such a powerful element of the central bank toolkit at critical moments and yet is possible to unwind later without undoing the benefits that QE provided. When the economy suffers a severe negative shock, or when markets experience severe dysfunction, central bank asset holdings can have a large influence on financial conditions through the portfolio-balance, signaling and liquidity channels. Deploying QE at such times can support the economy and market functioning. As the economic and market stressors diminish, the relevance of the central bank’s asset holdings for financial conditions will moderate on its own, even before the central bank begins normalizing its balance sheet. And that means the eventual initiation of QT typically has much less impact than the onset of QE.\n\nSo far, I’ve focused on asymmetries in how QE and QT affect asset markets. Now, let me turn to an asymmetry on the other side of the balance sheet, one that receives less attention in the paper but that I see as important to the continued success of the Fed’s ongoing balance sheet normalization.\n\nBecause changes in central bank assets also change the central bank’s liabilities—such as reserves—QE and QT also affect funding markets. I’d argue, and we see some evidence for this in the paper, that the effects on asset markets are more prominent during QE, while the effects on funding markets are more prominent during QT. One reason is that the measured asset market effects are typically larger for QE than QT. But in addition, the funding market implications of QE and QT differ, especially in the floor system that the FOMC began using to implement monetary policy post-GFC.\n\nIn a floor system, the Fed controls money market rates primarily by adjusting the administered rates that we pay on liabilities such as reserves and the overnight reverse repo (ON RRP) facility. These administered rates create a floor under market rates regardless of the quantity of reserves we supply. One significant benefit of a floor system is that it allows us to maintain rate control while acquiring assets when necessary to achieve our economic and financial stability objectives. By contrast, at the onset of the GFC, we operated with scarce reserves and controlled money market rates primarily by adjusting the supply of reserves to move up and down the demand curve. That meant the reserve growth resulting from our initial asset purchases in the GFC generated significant money market volatility.[9] In a floor system, reserve growth during QE can produce some modest downward pressure on money market rates, but that pressure is limited.\n\nThe flip side of a floor system’s ability to absorb reserve growth, though, is that the regime works only when reserves are sufficient to meet banks’ demand at close to market rates. If reserves drop too far, we would fall out of the floor system and see substantial upward pressure on money market rates. While our ceiling tools such as the Standing Repo Facility (SRF) and discount window provide significant backstops against such a scenario, the response of money market conditions to reserve levels in the floor system is fundamentally asymmetric. There’s more upside rate risk from reserves falling too low than downside rate risk from reserves rising too high.\n\nThe challenge today is knowing how far to go in normalizing the balance sheet. In 2019, the FOMC decided that it would operate in the long run with a version of the floor system where reserves are “ample.”[10] The word “ample” suggests comfortably but efficiently meeting banks’ demand. As I’ve argued elsewhere, the Friedman rule provides a guide to the efficient supply of reserves in the ample-reserves regime.[11] Banks’ opportunity cost of holding reserves should be approximately equal to the central bank’s cost of supplying reserves.\n\nMost analysts view the cost of supplying reserves as small. So, since banks’ opportunity cost of holding reserves is the spread between money market rates and the interest rate on reserve balances (IORB), the ample level of reserves is one where spreads of money market rates to IORB are generally small. Comfortably meeting banks’ reserve demand at close to market rates also puts them on the flat part of the demand curve for reserves. Hence, when reserves are ample, money market rates should not move much with fluctuations in reserve supply due to changes in autonomous factors such as the Treasury General Account.[12] In light of the substantial volatility of autonomous factors, this implies the ample level includes a buffer of reserves above the minimum needed to meet banks’ demand.\n\nWhen money market spreads to IORB are small, banks will avoid economizing excessively on reserves and taking inappropriate liquidity risk. By contrast, when reserves are below ample and money market rates are meaningfully above IORB, banks face an implicit tax on liquidity. This can make the financial system less safe and less efficient. More-than-ample reserve levels are also inefficient. Currently, for example, money market rates are running as much as 10 basis points below IORB, tilting the liquidity playing field away from nonbanks that can’t hold reserves. While it was necessary and appropriate to temporarily expand the Fed’s balance sheet in response to the economic and financial stresses of the pandemic, it’s important to normalize the balance sheet and remove these inefficiencies now that the stresses have passed.\n\nI know that everyone is really hoping I’ll go one step further and say what level of reserves corresponds to the ample level. I’m going to disappoint you. Banks’ demand for reserves varies significantly over time as the economy and financial system evolve. For example, the liquidity stresses last March inspired many banks to reevaluate how they manage reserves, and supervisory or regulatory developments could lead to further changes in reserve demand. So, I don’t think we can identify the ample level in advance. We’ll need to feel our way to it by observing money market spreads and volatility.\n\nTo me, the need to feel our way means that when ON RRP balances approach a low level, it will be appropriate to slow the pace of asset runoff. As long as there are significant balances in the ON RRP facility, we can be confident that liquidity is more than ample in the aggregate. But once the ON RRP is empty, there will be more uncertainty about how much excess liquidity remains. Moreover, the current pace of runoff is about twice what it was in the first half of 2019. This hasn’t yet reduced reserves because funds have come out of the ON RRP facility instead. After the ON RRP is drained, asset runoff will reduce reserves 1-for-1, all else equal. In this environment, moving more slowly can reduce the risk of an accident that would require us to stop too soon.\n\nReserves don’t necessarily come out of all banks equally. Some firms can approach scarcity well before others. So, as reserves fall, the system has to redistribute them. And banks can’t perfectly anticipate their outflows. The faster the Fed’s balance sheet shrinks, the larger are the outflow surprises that banks confront, the more challenging the redistribution becomes, and the greater the risk that we go too far and see undue money market pressures.\n\nSlower runoff, therefore, is a way to approach the ample point more gradually, allowing banks to redistribute funds and the FOMC to carefully judge when we have gone far enough. This strategy will mitigate the risk of undesired liquidity stresses from QT.\n\nI want to emphasize that slowing, to me, doesn’t mean stopping. In fact, I believe that proceeding more gradually may allow the Fed to eventually get to a smaller balance sheet by providing banks with more time to adjust. As I said earlier, the eventual stopping point should depend on what we observe in money market volatility and spreads.\n\nIn that regard, I’d emphasize that ample reserves doesn’t mean eliminating all rate volatility or collapsing all money market spreads to precisely zero. Money markets and their participants are real-world institutions, not a theoretical ideal. It’s not the role of monetary policy to eliminate the various small frictions that arise in reality, and I expect we’ll continue to see minor spreads and rate fluctuations even when we operate with ample reserves in the long run.\n\nI also want to note that while the ample level of reserves is unknown, I see considerably less uncertainty about the appropriate long-run level of ON RRP balances in the ample-reserves regime. The Fed’s operating regime is intended to supply ample reserves to banks—but only ample reserves and not more than that. In an environment with persistent and meaningful ON RRP balances, money market rates would tend to fall well below IORB, meaning that liquidity would be more than ample. While some observers have argued that maintaining significant ON RRP balances in the long run could provide a buffer against money market volatility, that buffer would come at the expense of supplying more than the efficient level of reserves and creating an unlevel liquidity playing field between banks and nonbanks.\n\nTo conclude, I would like to again thank the authors for this informative paper and the organizers for the opportunity to comment on it. Not only is the topic fascinating in its own right, but this discussion provides an important public service. To achieve the Fed’s goals of maximum employment and stable prices, we must continuously deepen our understanding of how our tools affect financial conditions and the broader economy. I am grateful to the authors and all of you involved in this conference for your contributions to this knowledge.\n\nThank you.\n\nNotes",

            "content": "Thank you for that kind introduction, Ellen [Meade]. It’s great to be here at Duke and to have a chance to talk about monetary policy with one of my favorite former Federal Reserve colleagues.\n\nToday, I’d like to discuss the progress we’ve made toward the Fed’s macroeconomic goals, as well as the risks ahead. The views I share are mine and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nAs you know, inflation surged in 2021 and 2022 on the heels of the economic disruptions from the pandemic. The annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) peaked at more than 7 percent, far above our 2 percent target. The FOMC responded by rapidly raising the target range for the federal funds rate—a total of 5.25 percentage points over a year and a half. These actions aimed to bring the economy into better balance so we can sustainably achieve both of our Congressionally mandated goals: stable prices and maximum employment.\n\nWe have made substantial progress toward that objective. For the second half of 2023, PCE inflation was just 2.1 percent, annualized. Moreover, while the labor market cooled from its overheated pace in early 2023, it remained strong, with the unemployment rate holding below 4 percent. The combination of cooler inflation and still-strong economic activity in the second half of 2023 inspired optimism that the economy was on a benign track toward restoring price stability without too much cost to workers, businesses, families and communities.\n\nIn the first two months of 2024, however, inflation data surprised to the upside. In the rest of my remarks, I’ll assess the economic outlook and risks in light of these recent developments. My bottom line is that while the benign path back to price stability remains possible, I see meaningful risks to continued progress.\n\nIt’s remarkable how resilient the economy has been to the increases in interest rates over the past two years. While the FOMC’s rate increases were necessary to restore price stability, the rapid pace carried a risk of a nonlinear reaction in financial markets or the economy. This was one reason I supported slowing the pace in late 2022 even as I remained committed to raising rates as high as necessary to accomplish the FOMC’s dual-mandate goals.\n\nAt times last year, we saw data that some interpreted as cracks in the economy and labor market, and we heard concerns from financial market and business contacts that a recession could be imminent. But today, contacts consistently tell me they see a soft landing as the most likely scenario. In the Dallas Fed’s most recent Texas Business Outlook Surveys, half of respondents said they expect demand to pick up over the next six months. The risk of an abrupt deterioration in economic activity appears to be fading.\n\nMoreover, immigration and innovation have continued to support the supply side of the economy.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently reported a major upward revision in estimates of net immigration. Relative to estimates made last year, the CBO now calculates that an additional 4 million people immigrated to the United States from 2021 through 2023. And the CBO now projects 4.4 million more immigrants from 2024 through 2026, again relative to estimates made in 2023. Dallas Fed economists judge that the CBO estimates are more of an upper bound than a mid-range estimate. The calculations assume relatively high numbers of undetected border crossings and relatively low rates of unmeasured return migration. Nevertheless, the inflows are clearly very large. We’ve seen them firsthand in the Dallas Fed’s district.\n\nBecause many immigrants come to the United States seeking to participate in our vibrant economy, they add significantly to the labor force. This helps explain the combination of robust payroll growth with stable unemployment and a less-tight labor market over the past year. The implications for the economic outlook, of course, depend on how long this wave of immigration continues and on whether immigration affects aggregate demand as much as aggregate supply.\n\nTurning to innovation, we could also be at the beginning of an era of stronger productivity growth.\n\n\n\nGiven the uncertainties, I’m not ready to put higher trend productivity in my baseline outlook. However, the risks to productivity appear clearly skewed to the upside. Stronger productivity growth would open space for economic activity and wages to rise without generating above-target inflation.\n\nOn the other hand, I’m increasingly concerned about upside risk to the inflation outlook. To be clear, the key risk is not that inflation might rise—though monetary policymakers must always remain on guard against that outcome—but rather that inflation will stall out and fail to follow the forecast path all the way back to 2 percent in a timely way.\n\nAssessing the inflation outlook can be challenging because large swings in the prices of a few narrow categories of goods or services can temporarily throw off the headline readings. For this reason, to judge where overall inflation is headed, I find it helpful to look at measures that remove outliers, like the Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate.\n\nGiven the strength in the trimmed mean late last year, I had expected inflation to firm over the first half of 2024. Even so, January’s inflation print was disappointing. January wasn’t a story of outliers. The entire distribution of price changes shifted to the right. Residual seasonality could help explain the firm January data, but if so, the improvement in inflation in the second half of 2023 was overstated.\n\nAnd the data for February, though better than January’s, weren’t great. The six-month and 12-month core and trimmed mean PCE inflation rates all landed around 3 percent, and the three-month rates were somewhat higher.\n\nAgainst this backdrop of disappointingly firm inflation data, I wasn’t surprised when a business executive in my district shared that the company’s unions are demanding contracts that incorporate compensation for future inflation. Reports like this reinforce the importance of bringing inflation sustainably back to the FOMC’s 2 percent target. We need to fulfill our commitment to the public. And we need to keep inflation expectations anchored.\n\nBeyond the inflation data, I’m concerned that the stance of monetary policy may not be as restrictive as most forecasts assume. I’ve previously talked about how I assess whether broad financial conditions are sufficiently restrictive. Today, I want to share an additional dimension of my thinking. Economists often assess whether monetary policy is boosting or slowing growth and inflation by comparing the policy rate to a theoretical level, called the neutral rate, that would represent neither a headwind nor a tailwind. Failing to recognize a sustained move up in the neutral rate could lead to overaccommodative monetary policy.\n\nNow, the neutral rate—r-star for short—is notoriously uncertain and difficult to measure. But you can get a sense of where FOMC participants think it is by looking at the long-run projections for the fed funds rate in our Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). From mid-2019 through the end of last year, the median of those long-run projections was almost always 2.5 percent—implying a neutral real rate of 0.5 percent after accounting for the 2 percent inflation target. At our most recent meeting, that median ticked up to a 0.6 percent real rate.\n\nThe right tail of the distribution has spread out considerably, though. Seven FOMC participants now project a long-run fed funds rate of at least 3 percent—corresponding to a neutral real rate of at least 1 percent—compared with just three participants making such projections a year ago.\n\nAnd, economic and financial evidence is accumulating that the long-run neutral rate has likely moved up. I divide the evidence into three buckets: fundamentals, model estimates and financial market prices.\n\nEconomic theory suggests that fundamental drivers of investment and growth influence the neutral interest rate over time. Growing federal deficits have greatly expanded the supply of safe assets. Meanwhile, between the energy transition, nearshoring and the growth of AI, there are many sources of increasingly strong investment demand. And, as I mentioned earlier, we could be seeing the beginnings of higher productivity growth. All of these factors should raise the neutral rate, all else equal.\n\nEconomists have also developed many models to estimate the neutral real interest rate. My team and I reviewed a suite of these models. None of them gives a point estimate as low as the 0.6 percent median in the latest SEP. Some models estimate a neutral real rate above 2 percent, corresponding to a neutral federal funds rate above 4 percent given the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation target. All of the model estimates are imprecise and have wide confidence intervals, however. And some of the models technically measure a short-run concept of the neutral rate, though in these cases the measures are highly persistent and are also informative about the long run.\n\nFinally, financial market prices reveal market participants’ views on the neutral rate. The 5-year, 5-year-forward real rate on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities is around 2 percent. That interest rate incorporates a term premium that isn’t included in the neutral level of short-term rates. But the gap to the SEP median is larger than most model-based estimates of far-forward term premiums.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Primary Dealers also suggests market participants expect higher real overnight rates in the long run. The difference between respondents’ median estimates for the long-run fed funds rate and the long-run inflation rate has risen from 0.5 percent to around 0.9 percent over the past year.\n\nMarkets aggregate the information of investors across the economy. While we may not be sure exactly how much each of the fundamental factors has moved, how those moves translate into r-star, or which model is right, we can learn from what markets are saying about the combined effect. And, as I formulate my views on appropriate policy, I’m taking evidence of sustained shifts in the neutral rate into account, alongside all the other evidence on the economic and financial outlook. Although the neutral rate is uncertain, using the information we do have on it can help ensure monetary policy is set so that broad financial conditions will be sufficiently restrictive to achieve our dual-mandate goals.\n\nTo return to the big picture, the inflation concerns I just described are upside risks, not my baseline outlook.\n\nNevertheless, in light of these risks, I believe it’s much too soon to think about cutting interest rates. I will need to see more of the uncertainty resolved about which economic path we’re on. And, as always, the FOMC should remain prepared to respond appropriately if inflation stops falling. A flexible approach to monetary policy will provide time to continue assessing the data and outlook and make the best choices to sustainably achieve both stable prices and maximum employment.\n\nFinally, a few words about the Fed’s asset holdings. After acquiring close to $5 trillion in assets in 2020 through 2022 to support the economy and the smooth functioning of financial markets amid the pandemic, the FOMC has been allowing some assets to mature to normalize our balance sheet. We have reduced our balance sheet by about $1.5 trillion so far.\n\nReducing our asset holdings also removes liquidity from the financial system. So far, more than the entire reduction in our balance sheet has come out of the overnight reverse repurchase (ON RRP) agreement facility, where counterparties such as money market funds can place excess cash at the Fed. As a result, bank reserves have actually increased since 2022. But ON RRP balances are now down to somewhat above $400 billion. Once those balances are depleted, asset runoff will reduce bank reserves one for one, all else equal. Moreover, the current pace of asset runoff is about twice what it was in early 2019, the last time we normalized our balance sheet. Overly rapid reductions in bank reserves could outpace money markets’ ability to redistribute reserves to the banks that need them most. That would risk pressures that could force us to stop balance sheet normalization prematurely.\n\nWe typically announce changes in our asset redemptions in advance to avoid disrupting the market. Yet it’s difficult to predict exactly when ON RRP balances will be depleted, because the rate of decrease has been volatile. It depends on many factors besides the Fed’s asset holdings—in particular, tax payments and Treasury bill issuance, which are both in flux at this time of year.\n\nSo, I believe it will soon be appropriate for the FOMC to decide when to slow—not stop—the runoff of our asset holdings. A slower but still meaningful pace will provide more time for banks and money market participants to redistribute liquidity and for the FOMC to assess liquidity conditions. It will also reduce the risk of going too far. I see this as a technical decision to ensure effective policy implementation and support a smooth path to an efficient balance sheet size. It should not have much effect on broader financial conditions. And it is unrelated to considerations of the appropriate degree of policy restriction to achieve our dual-mandate goals.\n\nThank you. I look forward to our conversation.",

            "content": "Welcome. Thank you, Mark [Wynne], for the introduction. I’m excited to be here with you all today and to welcome you to the Dallas Fed.\n\nThis week’s conference will focus on how banks fund their activities. Funding is a basic aspect of banking, and it particularly comes into focus during stress episodes, such as the one we experienced last year. Funding models can also influence the diversity and competitiveness of the banking system over time, and in my remarks today, I’m going to spotlight those considerations.\n\nI’m so pleased that our friends at the Atlanta Fed collaborated with us to organize and host this conference, including my colleague President Raphael Bostic, who will speak tomorrow. I’m delighted to be joined by so many distinguished banking and policy leaders, including Federal Reserve Gov. Michelle Bowman, who will give keynote remarks at dinner this evening; Agustin Carstens, general manager of the Bank for International Settlements, who will give tomorrow’s opening keynote; and my colleague Mary Daly, president of the San Francisco Fed, who will participate in a fireside chat this afternoon. And I’m thrilled to bring together industry, policymaker and academic perspectives for this important conversation.\n\nFunding risk is both one of the oldest challenges in banking and one of the most timely. The most basic activity banks do is transform deposits into longer-term investments. Banks accept deposits, promise to return them whenever depositors want and invest in the meantime in less-liquid assets, such as loans that finance investment and fuel economic growth.\n\nSo, as I’m sure the panelists in our history session this afternoon will discuss, bankers have long understood the importance of being prepared to meet withdrawals—and of maintaining depositors’ confidence so they don’t withdraw money based on unfounded fears.\n\nBut as we saw in 2023, maintaining depositors’ confidence can be challenging in today’s highly networked society that allows bank runs to propagate with unprecedented speed. Now that banking conditions have stabilized and the immediate pressures banks felt last year have passed—though we should always remain watchful for any risks that may emerge—it’s a good time to consider whether adjustments in banks’ liquidity risk management or in related public policies can support a strong and vibrant banking system in the modern environment.\n\nI’m looking forward to the ideas and insights all of you will share today and tomorrow. I’d like to start with a few perspectives of my own, and I’ll note these will be my perspectives and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\n\nFrom my standpoint, there are three main ways to ensure sound liquidity risk management in banking. First, regulations can require banks to hold a certain amount of liquid assets, or banks can choose to do so voluntarily. This approach is important, but relying exclusively on it would have a drawback. By limiting the amount of liquidity transformation banks do, this approach limits the amount of banking they do.\n\nSecond, as a complement to holding liquid assets, bankers and regulators can ensure banks have reliable and ready access to contingent funding sources. Contingent funding can come from private markets and from central bank backstops such as the Federal Reserve’s discount window and Standing Repo Facility or from similar facilities that other central banks offer firms in their countries with funding from dollar swap lines. We’ll have a panel on contingent liquidity tomorrow.\n\nAnd third, banks and regulators can work to stabilize the deposit and funding base. For example, diversifying deposit sources can make a bank’s funding more resilient. And deposit insurance can reinforce customers’ confidence that their money is safe, thus preventing bank runs and limiting the potential liquidity outflows that banks may need to meet.\n\nThese three approaches interact. Buffers of liquid assets and sound plans for contingent funding can reassure depositors and prevent runs, accomplishing some of the same goals as deposit insurance. And to the degree deposit insurance succeeds in preventing runs, banks may not need as much access to liquid assets or contingent funding.\n\nExperience over recent years has demonstrated that the discount window and the Fed’s other liquidity tools are effective in supporting the stability of the banking and financial systems and, in turn, the flow of credit to households and businesses. However, the payments and financial systems, the economy, and technology continue to evolve rapidly. That evolution can create new liquidity challenges and needs, as well as new opportunities for the Fed to serve the public efficiently and effectively.\n\nOur last full review of the discount window function took place more than 20 years ago. By examining our approach to discount window lending in the current environment and in light of recent experience, we can ensure the window continues to provide ready access to liquidity going forward.\n\nA critical element, in my view, is enhancing depository institutions’ operational readiness to use the discount window. In my opinion, every bank in America should be fully set up at the window as part of its liquidity toolkit. That means completing legal documents and establishing collateral arrangements well before any funding need arises. And it means testing the plumbing—practicing the steps needed to take out and repay a loan and to move collateral between the Fed and other funding sources. A bank facing a rapid run will not have the luxury of waiting for setup or learning the procedures.\n\nWorking together with bankers, the Federal Reserve System has already made substantial progress toward enhanced operational readiness at the window. More than 5,000 depository institutions have signed the necessary legal documents. They’ve pledged $3 trillion in collateral, up $1 trillion from last year. And we’ve launched Discount Window Direct, an online portal that lets depository institutions more efficiently request loans.\n\nI’m optimistic that through further modernization of our technology and policies, as well as ongoing partnership with banks, we can ensure the discount window remains a powerful tool for providing the banking system ample access to liquidity.\n\nTurning to deposit insurance, the Federal Reserve does not establish those policies. Deposit insurance is the responsibility of Congress, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the National Credit Union Administration. But deposit insurance policies do, as I mentioned, interact with liquidity provisions by the Fed, as well as our work supervising banks and promoting financial stability. So I’d like to offer some thoughts on those interactions and how deposit insurance can best support a banking ecosystem that serves our economy well.\n\nMy starting principle is that deposit insurance policies, like all banking policies, should support a level playing field and fair competition among banks. Fair competition is a fundamental element of our market economy. Across all industries, fair competition promotes innovation, opportunity and diverse business models that can meet the needs of many different customers. And that is just as true in banking as in any other business.\n\nI grew up in Versailles, Kentucky, a small town with a tight-knit community. In Versailles, like so many other small towns in the United States, our community bank catalyzed economic growth. Observing this relationship instilled in me an appreciation for how smaller banks support strong communities and local economies.\n\nMy conversations with business and community leaders as I travel the Eleventh District reinforce that appreciation. We heard from a woman in the Rio Grande Valley who dreamed of expanding her snack stand. She didn’t have financial statements to present to a bank for a loan. But the bankers at a local community bank were regular customers, and they got to talking about her ambitions. They realized she had a checking account at the bank, and the account history of revenue and expenses showed she had a viable business. The bankers worked with the snack stand owner to help her craft a business plan and get a loan to expand. She now has multiple locations and even several franchisees. That type of local knowledge and relationship-based lending is a specialty of smaller banks.\n\nCommunities’ needs vary. To maintain a vibrant banking system that can meet those diverse needs, policies should support a level playing field. That way, the banking models that best serve customers and communities will come out ahead in the marketplace.\n\nIn my view, a level playing field is achievable when it comes to deposit insurance, but that could require some change. Right now, a couple of factors related to deposit insurance come together to give the largest banks a potential advantage in attracting deposits. Federal insurance coverage is limited to $250,000 per depositor. That limit is supposed to give small depositors confidence while creating incentives for larger depositors to investigate their banks’ condition. While large depositors could theoretically provide helpful market discipline, they also often perceive—rightly or wrongly—that some banks are too big to fail and that the government will bail out those banks or their depositors in a crisis. Such perceptions undermine market discipline and tilt the playing field toward big banks.\n\nWhen I checked recently, several of the country’s biggest banks were offering interest rates of just 1 to 6 basis points on a standard savings account. How many community banks can attract deposits at rates like that, when money market rates are over 500 basis points? Of course, there are many reasons why the largest banks may be able to pay lower interest rates than other banks. For example, some customers may value these banks’ wide range of capital markets, settlement, custodial, international and other services or their extensive branch networks.\n\nBut the evidence of a tilt goes beyond interest rates. Amid the severe banking stresses in early 2023, we heard many reports of depositors pulling their funds from smaller banks and moving to the largest ones. Just in the second week of March 2023, deposits at the country’s 25 largest banks rose $113 billion, while deposits at all other domestic banks fell $172 billion. The shift was significant enough that executives at several of the largest banks mentioned it in their quarterly earnings calls. One described “significant new account opening activity and meaningful deposit and money market fund inflows,” while another reported seeing “noticeable flight to safety.” Meanwhile, at regional banks, executives were saying things like “68 percent of our dollars that went out, went out to larger banks, the money center banks,” and certain customers “wanted to pull money out from all regional banks.”\n\nIf you step back and look at how deposit insurance works, these actions by depositors aren’t surprising. And although the flows to larger banks ebbed as banking conditions calmed, the underlying incentives remain.\n\nEspecially when it comes to business accounts, $250,000 isn’t such a large deposit. A small business employing 110 people at the median wage would need $250,000 in its checking account just to cover a biweekly payroll. What small business owner has time to conduct regular, thorough checkups on a bank’s health? So, many depositors prefer to bank at institutions where they don’t have to think hard about whether their funds are safe.\n\nAnd there’s an important exception to the $250,000 limit. If a bank fails and the Treasury secretary and the boards of the FDIC and Federal Reserve agree there’s a serious threat to financial stability, the FDIC can cover all deposits, even those above the limit. The government makes no advance commitments about when it will invoke that systemic risk exception. The exception has sometimes been applied to cover uninsured deposits at relatively small banks, such as when Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank failed in 2023. Still, most depositors didn’t foresee that action. If they had, they probably wouldn’t have run on SVB and Signature in the first place. By contrast, while the government has not provided a formal guarantee to the eight U.S. firms designated as Global Systemically Important Banks, or G-SIBs, most market participants think it’s pretty unlikely the authorities would let those firms’ depositors lose money. After all, these banks are officially systemically important.\n\nThe perception that certain banks are too big to fail tilts the playing field. Some people argue that stringent regulations on big banks counterbalance any too-big-to-fail benefits. But even if the costs and benefits of size are equal most of the time, the equation breaks when stresses emerge and the value of a perceived guarantee is suddenly much larger.\n\nConceptually, there are a couple of possibilities for restoring balance. Regulators could adopt even tougher regulations on the largest banks. But such regulations could put a drag on the economy by raising big banks’ costs for some of the unique and critical intermediation services they provide. Or, authorities could increase the deposit insurance limit so that deposits would be more equally protected at all banks. The FDIC proposed some interesting options along those lines in a report last year. Of course, the benefits of a higher limit have to be weighed against potential costs, such as whether deposit insurance premiums would need to rise or whether a higher limit could increase moral hazard and encourage banks to take excessive risks.\n\nWe have a panel on deposit insurance this afternoon, and I’m eager to hear how the panelists weigh these and other costs and benefits. Ultimately Congress would make any decisions. But I would offer just a few more reasons why the current limit may be too low.\n\nFor starters, the economy has grown substantially since Congress last raised the limit in 2008. If the limit had increased since then in line with nominal gross domestic product, it would be nearly half a million dollars today.\n\nAnother reason is the invocation of the systemic risk exception to cover SVB and Signature in 2023. This was clearly the right decision to protect the economy and financial system once the banks had failed. But the need to provide insurance after the fact to depositors who weren’t supposed to receive it and whose banks had not been regulated as systemically important suggests to me the insurance limit was too low in the first place.\n\nLastly, I’d note the growing use of reciprocal deposit networks, which allow banks to swap deposits in excess of the limit with each other to provide depositors more insurance. Reciprocal deposits reached $379 billion in the first quarter of this year, up from $157 billion at the end of 2022. The vast majority of reciprocal deposits—89 percent—are at banks with less than $100 billion in assets. That reflects both the funding environment for smaller banks and the less-favorable regulatory treatment of very large reciprocal deposits.\n\nReciprocal deposits can cost banks more than 10 basis points in network fees. Smaller banks’ willingness to pay this cost to work around the deposit insurance limit suggests the limit’s too low. As a society, if we’re going to provide the insurance anyway—which is what happens when banks use reciprocal deposits—we may as well increase the limit so we can avoid the costs, operational risks and regulatory mirages involved in passing deposits back and forth between banks.\n\nStill, there is lots to learn here, and I’m eager to hear all of your views.\n\nTurning to our agenda, over the next day and a half, we’ll examine not only the role of deposit insurance in today’s financial system, but also the stressors that led to the events of last spring; lessons from historic financial crises; and the future of the discount window and other contingent liquidity sources. We’ll also have a roundtable discussion on what academics, bankers and regulators see as the key risks and challenges in bank funding.\n\nThese discussions will deepen our understanding of banks’ funding vulnerabilities and help the industry and regulators prepare better for the future.\n\nThank you all for joining us today, and many thanks to the entire team here and at the Atlanta Fed who worked so hard to make this conference happen.\n\nNow, let’s welcome Arthur Lindo, who will chair today’s first session, “A look back at the regional banking stresses of 2023.”",

            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Lorie Logan, and I serve as the president and CEO of the Dallas Fed.\n\nI’d like to thank Governor [Michelle] Bowman for kicking off our celebration and sharing her insights on the Federal Reserve’s role in community development. And thank you to everyone here, including external partners and Dallas Fed staff, for joining us today.\n\nIn particular, I’d like to recognize our guests of honor, leaders from our four Advance Together communities:\n\nCommunity development is one of the key functions of the Federal Reserve. And here at the Dallas Fed, we are working to build a strong economy where everyone has the opportunity to participate and thrive.\n\nThe Dallas Fed saw an opportunity to address institutional challenges at the heart of K-12 education and workforce development ecosystems here in the state by convening dedicated professionals from an array of backgrounds including:\n\nThe diverse perspectives offered by our partners are integral to the initiative’s work. Thank you all for your hard work over the last four years, and congratulations on the substantial progress you’ve achieved. Your commitment to building a brighter future for everyone in Texas is inspiring, and it has been an honor for us to be a part of these efforts.\n\nI’d like to share some background on why the Advance Together initiative was developed and how it came to life.\n\nAlthough Texas continues to stand out as one of the fastest-growing economies in the country, it also has the 10th-highest poverty rate in the nation. Across the state, many lower-income and historically underserved communities face barriers that hinder economic mobility and resilience. We see substantial disparities on indicators such as kindergarten readiness rates, grade-based reading levels, high school graduation rates and post-secondary-degree completion. At the Dallas Fed, we focus a large portfolio of our community development work on educational attainment and workforce development in hopes of closing gaps in these areas. In developing the Advance Together initiative, we decided to keep these areas at the forefront of our focus.\n\nOur place-based community development efforts, like Advance Together, are built from research and conversations with practitioners that show cross-sector collaboration is key to the economic growth of communities. These efforts support local cross-sectoral partnerships working to improve educational and employment opportunities and outcomes for lower-income communities, thus boosting long-term economic resilience and mobility for individuals and families. This work reinforces our mission to build a strong economy for all.\n\nEffective solutions to complex local problems in areas like education or workforce development often rely on champions from across the public, nonprofit and business sectors working together toward shared goals over a sustained period of time. Advance Together is a catalyst for this collaborative effort, coordinated by the Dallas Fed in the communities we partner with. We provide customized guidance, technical assistance, and trainings to our partners through our staff and external consultants. I would like to note that the Dallas Fed does not raise funds, provide funding for grants or participate in the selection of grantees. Rather, fundraising and grant funding is coordinated by our external philanthropic partners to provide grants to participating communities.\n\nThe Advance Together steering committee selects grantees and manages program funding. Members of this committee include state- and national-level workforce and education experts from the business, nonprofit, philanthropic and public sectors.\n\nBefore we launched Advance Together’s pilot round, the Dallas Fed and the steering committee explored existing cross-sector partnerships in the state that were addressing acute education and workforce development challenges. We identified nearly 90 coalitions during this search. While many of these coalitions articulated ambitious goals and aligned strategies, they [the coalitions] shared with us that their biggest challenges include a lack of infrastructure and dedicated capacity to manage and coordinate this work. This is where a targeted initiative like Advance Together can make a difference.\n\nAdvance Together strengthens local and regional partnerships, builds collective capacity for this work, and capitalizes on the expertise and experiences of local leaders to drive change. Through our support and in our role as impartial, neutral conveners and researchers, we have helped close institutional silos and elevate the work of these community partnerships beyond individual-level impact. Our application of technical assistance at the local level provides opportunities for communities to rally around improving long-term economic objectives that are inclusive of lower-income people.\n\nWe’ve seen meaningful impact from our pilot-round sites and substantial progress toward their shared goals.\n\nA few highlights include:\n\nI look forward to the Advance Together team leaders sharing more about the site-level progress during their panel discussion later this afternoon.\n\nThe Dallas Fed’s district covers Texas, southern New Mexico and northern Louisiana. Texas was selected as the focus for this pilot round due to its role as the primary driver of our district’s economy and our goal to generate state-level impact with this initiative.\n\nWe aspire to have Advance Together’s approach serve as a model for communities across our district and nationwide.\n\nYou will hear this afternoon from an array of leaders, including representatives from the four communities in Advance Together’s pilot round, as well as partners who contributed to the design and development of this initiative. I would like to thank these leaders for their service to the community and their dedication to the next generation. I hope their words will encourage many of you to apply for the next round of this initiative.\n\nI’d also like to thank our pilot-round partners including:\n\nI would also like to recognize Dallas Fed staff members who have contributed to the development and execution of Advance Together:\n\nThis initiative would not have been possible without strategic support and guidance from our communications, legal and procurement departments.\n\nFinally, I want to thank our Dallas Fed board of directors for their support of this impactful work.\n\nIn closing, I’d like to thank you all for being here today in celebration of this tremendous effort and the accomplishments of this team and our community partners.\n\nI’m happy to turn the mic over to Kseniya Benderskaya now, who will share more about our Advance Together pilot-round teams.",

            "content": "Thank you all for joining us today for the Eleventh District Banking Conference. I'm disappointed I can't be there in person with you, as I'm in Washington for a Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Nevertheless, I appreciate the opportunity to welcome you all to the Dallas Fed and to open today's conference. As always, the views I share are my own and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\n\nOur banking supervision team collaborated with our partners at the Texas Department of Banking to develop this summit with three goals in mind.\n\nAs you all know well, effectively managing risk is critical to success in banking, and it's particularly important because of the crucial position of banks in our economy.\n\nThe Eleventh District includes southern New Mexico, northern Louisiana and all of Texas. Our regional economy is one of the fastest growing in the nation. And integral to that growth is a large cohort of community and regional banks that help provide the resources businesses and families need to succeed, from lending to small businesses as they launch, to being among the first to support local communities after disasters such as this year's hurricane and wildfires. So it's essential for banks to effectively manage risk so they can continue providing these important services to their communities and the economy.\n\nI meet regularly with bankers one-on-one and in roundtables to hear what they're experiencing and how the Federal Reserve can continue to foster a strong banking system. The Dallas Fed also conducts the Banking Conditions Survey every six to seven weeks, in which we ask over 100 executives from banks and credit unions headquartered in our district to share their insights on credit and banking developments and the economy more broadly. I also meet regularly with bankers through our Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council. The council's 11 members represent institutions with less than $10 billion in assets from all parts of our district. The members share feedback on areas of focus, including regulations and exam activities. I bring these insights to my colleagues for our conversations about the Fed's approach to supervision and regulation.\n\nRisk management has been top-of-mind in those conversations with colleagues and bankers over the last couple of years, and I'm particularly focused on operational readiness to respond to any shocks that may occur. To maintain a dynamic banking system, we need all banks of all sizes to be resilient. In particular, well-managed banks have access to a diverse set of funding sources. And in my view, every bank in America should be fully set up at the discount window. This means completing legal documents, pledging collateral and practicing the steps needed to borrow well in advance, so the banks are prepared to use the window if needed. Banks need to be proactive about these preparations. An institution facing a rapid run won't have the luxury of waiting for setup or learning the procedures.\n\nWorking together with bankers, the Fed has made substantial progress toward enhanced operational readiness at the window. More than 5,000 depository institutions nationally have signed the necessary legal documents, pledging $3 trillion in collateral. This is up $1 trillion in collateral from a year earlier. And earlier this year, we launched Discount Window Direct, which is an online portal for depository institutions to use to request loans.\n\nIf you'd like to enhance your bank's preparations to borrow from the window, or just share feedback on how the window works, we'll have booths just outside the conference room where you can talk with our staff.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Board recently issued a request for information on the operational practices of the discount window. You can submit comments directly through the Federal Reserve's website. We're accepting input through the beginning of December. If you have any questions on how to submit feedback, please reach out to someone from our team for more information.\n\nI'm optimistic that with further modernization of our technology and policies, as well as ongoing partnerships with banks, we can ensure the discount window remains a powerful tool for providing the banking system ample access to liquidity.\n\nIn closing, I hope today's conference provides an opportunity for open and candid conversations about how we can work together to mitigate risks and maintain a safe and sound financial system.\n\nThank you to the Dallas Fed's banking supervision team for your work planning for today's conference, in addition to our partners at the Texas Department of Banking. A special thank-you to Commissioner Charles Cooper for joining.\n\nAnd thank you all again for taking the time to be with us today to discuss these important issues.",

            "content": "Thank you for that kind introduction, Katie [Pryor], and thank you for the opportunity to be part of today’s program.\n\nI would like to start by recognizing the work of the Greater Houston Partnership. The partnership connects business and community leaders to address critical issues for the region’s economy. We at the Dallas Fed are grateful for our collaboration with the GHP. Several of our directors and advisory committee members, people we rely on for real-time insight on the economy, also serve as GHP board members or staff. It is wonderful to see Dr. Ruth Simmons here today. Dr. Simmons is chair of the Dallas Fed’s Houston board as well as a member of the GHP board. And we’re so pleased that Daron Peschel, senior vice president and our Houston regional executive, is able to serve on the GHP board as well.\n\nIt’s always great to visit Houston. This is an incredible city and a vital contributor to the U.S. and global economies. Houston is the energy capital of the world and an international hub for energy innovation. Its geography, infrastructure and workforce also make it a vibrant center for industries including logistics, aerospace, health care and biotechnology. Houston was the very first city I visited outside Dallas when I began a listening tour of the region after joining the Dallas Fed as president and CEO two years ago. And every time I return, I’m more impressed with the city’s dynamism, the powerful partnerships between business and community leaders, and the innovation taking place here.\n\nAs you’d expect in such a dynamic place, a lot has changed since my first visit to Houston in early October of 2022—new solar, wind and carbon capture projects; the Energy Department’s selection of Houston as a hydrogen hub; continued expansion at the Texas Medical Center; and ambitious lunar plans at NASA. Still, the foundational elements of energy, geography, infrastructure and workforce that I learned about in 2022 have stayed in place.\n\nThe same is true for the national economy since 2022; a lot has changed, but a lot remains the same. Today, I’ll share with you how my thinking on the economy has evolved and how I’m continuing to apply some foundational considerations to the economic challenges we face today. As always, these views are mine and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nWhen I think about what we do at the Federal Reserve, it’s all about advancing an economy where everyone has opportunities to thrive.\n\nAt the Dallas Fed, we describe our work as “Building a Strong Economy Together.” The Dallas Fed is one of the 12 reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. We are the nation’s central bank, and we perform five functions to support a strong economy for everyone in the United States:\n\nAs I’m sure you recall, inflation two years ago was much too high. The FOMC aims for 2 percent annual inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE. But as of mid-2022, prices had risen more than 7 percent since a year earlier. Soaring prices strained the budgets of families and businesses and had the potential to destabilize our economy over time.\n\nAt the same time, the labor market was incredibly strong—by many measures, unsustainably so. With companies adding jobs faster than the labor force was adding workers, wages surged. While those higher wages weren’t enough, for many workers, to keep pace with the cost of living, the wage pressures threatened to cause businesses to raise prices even more.\n\nThe FOMC responded by rapidly tightening monetary policy. We raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 5.25 percentage points from early 2022 through mid-2023. We also began running off securities holdings that we had accumulated to support the economy during the pandemic.\n\nThese measures helped bring the economy into much better balance. The most recent annual PCE inflation reading was 2.2 percent. Progress on inflation has been broad based; it’s not just a few outlying price categories that have cooled. You can see that in the Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate, which removes outliers and has fallen from a peak of 5 percent two years ago to 2.67 percent on an annual basis in August. And, while the labor market remains healthy, it has cooled as well.\n\nIn light of this progress, I supported the FOMC’s decision last month to begin normalizing the stance of monetary policy by lowering the target range for the fed funds rate. Less-restrictive policy will help avoid cooling the labor market by more than is necessary to bring inflation back to target in a sustainable and timely way.\n\nTo recap, the economic and monetary policy picture today is entirely different from two years ago:\n\nWhat haven’t changed are the key considerations I’m applying in thinking about the FOMC’s policy choices. First among those, of course, is my commitment to sustainably achieving both of our dual-mandate goals: maximum employment and stable prices. I also continue to carefully consider the risks and uncertainties we face. The appropriate policy strategy depends on whether the path ahead is clear or cloudy. And I continue to pay close attention to financial conditions and to the information I receive from business and community contacts and the Dallas Fed’s regional surveys. While the FOMC controls the overnight fed funds rate, households and businesses usually borrow at longer tenors. Understanding how our monetary policy stance translates to broader financial conditions and the day-to-day experiences of households and businesses is crucial for understanding the economic outlook and how monetary policy may need to respond.\n\nIn the rest of my remarks, I’ll share how I’m thinking about the economic outlook and upcoming monetary policy decisions in light of those considerations. I’ll discuss inflation and employment in turn. And I will argue that, following last month’s half-percentage-point cut in the fed funds rate, a more gradual path back to a normal policy stance will likely be appropriate from here to best balance the risks to our dual-mandate goals.\n\nThe Fed’s inflation target is for overall inflation, including the prices of all consumer goods and services. But to get a handle on where overall inflation will head in the future, I like to focus on measures that exclude volatile outliers and unusual shocks, such as the Dallas Fed trimmed mean that I described earlier. The drop in the trimmed mean since 2022 demonstrates that we’ve reduced inflation for most goods and services. The trimmed mean has continued to move down recently, though progress has become more gradual. The 12-month measure remains somewhat elevated even as shorter-term trimmed mean measures have approached 2 percent.\n\nTo understand whether monetary policy is restrictive enough to return overall inflation all the way to 2 percent, I have been paying particular attention to the inflation component that economists refer to as “core services.” This category includes services other than those related to energy, which are usually quite volatile. Because services are generally produced flexibly and domestically, core services inflation is typically more responsive to U.S. economic conditions and helps assess how monetary policy is influencing price pressures.\n\nWhile measures of inflation for both housing services and other core services remain above their prepandemic levels, recent trends have been encouraging. I expect that a couple of factors will help bring these components down to levels consistent with 2 percent overall inflation over time. The stance of monetary policy is still restrictive and should continue to restrain demand for both housing and other services. And longer-term inflation expectations reflected in surveys and financial market prices remain close to our 2 percent target, anchoring decisions by price and wage setters.\n\nThe healing of supply chains since the pandemic has reduced inflation, too. Energy and food inflation, two categories that are susceptible to supply shocks, contributed to the inflation surge in 2021 and 2022 but are now holding down overall inflation. Core goods inflation has returned to its slightly negative prepandemic level. That’s a result not only of healthier supply chains but also of cooler goods demand.\n\nAll that said, while the upside risks to inflation have diminished, they have not vanished. I continue to see a meaningful risk that inflation could get stuck above our 2 percent goal.\n\nOne way such a scenario could play out would be if aggregate demand proves stronger than most forecasts currently assume. The ongoing resilience in consumption and gross domestic product (GDP) hint at the potential for unexpectedly strong demand, as do recent upward revisions to data on gross domestic income and the savings rate.\n\nFinancial conditions could also boost demand beyond what the economy can sustain. As I mentioned earlier, the fed funds target influences economic activity only indirectly, because most households and businesses pay longer-term interest rates that also reflect their creditworthiness. Financial conditions have eased notably from a year ago. Mortgage rates have dropped, equity prices are near all-time highs, and credit spreads are near historic lows. Even if the current assessment of demand is on target, an unwarranted further easing in financial conditions could boost spending and push aggregate demand out of balance with supply.\n\nThese risks suggest the FOMC should not rush to reduce the fed funds target to a “normal” or “neutral” level but rather should proceed gradually while monitoring the behavior of financial conditions, consumption, wages and prices.\n\nA related upside risk to inflation stems from uncertainty regarding what the “neutral” level of the federal funds rate even is. Besides examining broad financial conditions, economists often consider whether monetary policy is boosting or slowing growth and inflation by comparing the policy rate to a theoretical level that would represent neither a headwind nor a tailwind. That neutral rate is notoriously uncertain and difficult to measure. But you can get a sense for it from economic fundamentals, models, surveys and market prices. And all of these suggest the neutral rate may be higher than before the pandemic.\n\nStructural changes in the economy, like the energy transition and advances in artificial intelligence, are a prime driver. These developments are fueling strong investment demand as well as potential increases in productivity. You can see the changes in investment firsthand throughout Texas, in projects like the enormous liquefied natural gas plants under construction along the Gulf Coast, the semiconductor fabs encouraged by the CHIPS [Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors] Act, as well as new data centers and the energy sources to supply them.\n\nImportantly, though, uncertainty about the neutral rate has also risen, perhaps because these changes in the economy are quite recent and will take time to fully assess. The FOMC’s own projections display the uncertainty. Four times a year, we release our projections for the fed funds rate as well as unemployment, inflation and GDP growth. Around the FOMC table, participants’ projections for the longer-run fed funds rate now vary by more than 1 percentage point, compared with a spread less than half that wide two years ago. In this uncertain environment, lowering the policy rate gradually would allow time to judge how restrictive monetary policy may or may not be and reduce the risk of inadvertently boosting inflation by bringing the policy rate below its neutral level.\n\nFinally, I remain attentive to inflation risks from supply chains and geopolitical developments. I am closely watching the aftermath of the recent strike at the Port of Houston and other Gulf Coast and East Coast ports. The Dallas Fed’s contacts tell us the three-day work stoppage isn’t likely to leave a lasting mark on supply chains. But workers and port operators have agreed to revisit their contract in January, so risks remain. I am also closely watching the conflict in the Middle East. As Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said, while the human toll is devastating, the Federal Reserve’s institutional role is a limited one: to monitor the economic implications. U.S. and global energy markets are currently somewhat slack, which has held down risk premiums in oil markets. However, the potential for more significant disruptions and price impacts cannot be ruled out.\n\nTurning to the employment side of the FOMC’s dual mandate, labor markets appear close to balanced. Job gains have slowed from their torrid pace two years ago. However, as the most recent employment report showed, firms are continuing to hire workers across a broad range of sectors. The unemployment rate has risen from historic lows. It averaged 4.2 percent over the past three months, which is near or just below most experts’ judgments of the rate consistent with stable inflation.\n\nStill, the labor market remains healthy. There are more job openings than unemployed workers nationally. The rise in unemployment over the past year is due mainly to labor force growth and slower hiring rather than more people losing jobs. Layoffs and initial claims for unemployment insurance remain low.\n\nStrong consumption and investment growth continue to support the job market. Real GDP grew at a 3 percent annual rate, seasonally adjusted, in the second quarter. Timely measures of economic activity, such as the Dallas Fed’s Weekly Economic Index and the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow tracker, suggest strong growth in the third quarter as well. And results from the Dallas Fed’s most recent Texas Business Outlook Surveys indicate that firms generally expect activity to remain solid over the next six months.\n\nNonetheless, as the labor market has cooled, we face more risk that it will cool beyond what is needed to sustainably return inflation to 2 percent or that the employment situation may even deteriorate abruptly.\n\nAssessing the labor market risks is challenging because the data are unusually uncertain of late. Over the summer, the Bureau of Labor Statistics significantly lowered its estimates of payroll job growth through last March, due largely to changing estimates of how many businesses have formed or closed. The bureau could further revise the figures as additional benchmarking data become available. Faster immigration, meanwhile, makes it more difficult to precisely judge the rate of job growth that’s consistent with a stable labor market. And because it takes time for new immigrants to integrate into the labor market, they could temporarily raise the unemployment rate even if the market remains strong. Storms and strikes, meanwhile, will complicate the interpretation of this month’s jobs report. In light of these uncertainties, just as with inflation, I believe the FOMC can best balance the labor market risks for now by normalizing policy gradually—neither waiting too long to act nor moving too quickly and risking going too far.\n\nTo sum up, the economy is much closer to sustainably achieving the FOMC’s goals of maximum employment and price stability now than it was two years ago. The changes in the economy call for a different stance of monetary policy. But the considerations I’m applying in assessing the appropriate stance remain the same:\n\nAs I consider the economic statistics, financial conditions, and reports from business and community contacts, two takeaways stand out to me. First, the economy is strong and stable. But second, meaningful uncertainties remain in the outlook. Downside risks to the labor market have increased, balanced against diminished but still real upside risks to inflation. And many of these risks are complex to assess and measure. As we complete the return to price stability and a well-balanced labor market, the path ahead is cloudy, not clear.\n\nIf the economy evolves as I currently expect, a strategy of gradually lowering the policy rate toward a more normal or neutral level can help manage the risks and achieve our mandated goals. It should go without saying, though, that the future is uncertain. Any number of shocks could influence what that path to normal will look like, how fast policy should move and where rates should settle. Policy should not follow a preset course. In my view, the FOMC will need to remain nimble and willing to adjust if appropriate.\n\nThank you.\n\nNote\n\nI am grateful to Sam Schulhofer-Wohl and Rebecca Zarutskie for assistance in preparing these remarks.",

            "content": "Thank you, Ken [Bentsen]. It’s great to be back at SIFMA.\n\nThe last time I spoke at a SIFMA event, in April 2021, I was serving as manager of the Federal Reserve’s System Open Market Account. I discussed how the expansion of our balance sheet to support the economy amid the pandemic was influencing money market conditions and policy implementation.\n\nToday, I will return to the topics of money markets and the Fed’s balance sheet, but from a new perspective as a policymaker and in a very different economic environment.\n\nThe economy\n\nLet me start by reviewing the economic situation. As always, these views are mine and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe FOMC held the fed funds target range at the effective lower bound from March 2020 through March 2022 to support the economy during the pandemic, then raised the target range rapidly in 2022 and 2023 in response to surging inflation. Last month, with inflation and employment both in striking distance of the FOMC’s goals rather than seriously overheated, we decided to lower the target range.\n\nLess-restrictive policy will help avoid cooling the labor market by more than is necessary to bring inflation back to target in a sustainable and timely way. In thinking about the policy choices ahead, I continue to apply the same foundational considerations I’ve applied since I became president of the Dallas Fed two years ago. First and foremost, I’m committed to sustainably achieving both of the FOMC’s dual-mandate goals: maximum employment and stable prices. I’m also carefully considering how the risk environment affects our strategy. The appropriate policy strategy depends on whether the path ahead is clear or cloudy.

Downside risks to the labor market have increased, balanced against diminished but still real upside risks to inflation. And many of these risks are complex to assess and measure.\n\nIf the economy evolves as I currently expect, a strategy of gradually lowering the policy rate toward a more normal or neutral level can help manage the risks and achieve our goals. However, any number of shocks could influence what that path to normal will look like, how fast policy should move and where rates should settle. In my view, the FOMC will need to remain nimble and willing to adjust if appropriate.\n\nBalance sheet normalization\n\nAs we begin to normalize the fed funds target range, we are also continuing the process we began in 2022 of normalizing our balance sheet by allowing longer-term asset holdings to mature.\n\nChanges in the fed funds target range are, as the FOMC has stated, our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy. With the target range well away from the effective lower bound, at this time we can accomplish our inflation and employment goals by adjusting the target range, while allowing balance sheet runoff to continue smoothly in the background as we move toward an efficient balance sheet size.\n\nIt's sometimes suggested that the reduction in asset holdings works at cross purposes to the strategy of reducing policy restriction by lowering the fed funds target range. I don’t see it that way, for two reasons. First, we are moving the target range toward neutral from above. The policy rate remains restrictive, which is consistent with also creating restriction by reducing asset holdings. Second, we are now normalizing both of our policy tools. Normalizing the fed funds rate means bringing it down from the elevated levels that were needed to restore price stability and returning to a level that will be consistent with sustaining maximum employment and price stability over time. Normalizing our balance sheet means bringing our asset holdings down from the elevated quantity that was necessary to support the economy during the pandemic and returning to a balance sheet size that will be consistent with implementing monetary policy efficiently and effectively. Those two normalization processes work in tandem and are consistent in my view. A number of other central banks are similarly reducing their asset holdings while lowering their policy rates in response to the changing economic outlook.\n\nThe normalization process will affect both sides of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. In the rest of my remarks, I will describe key policy considerations that I expect to affect the path of the Federal Reserve’s liabilities and assets in the long term, as well as some relatively near-term considerations that may arise along the way.\n\nLiabilities\n\nLet me start with liabilities. In 2019, the FOMC decided to implement monetary policy in the long run in a regime of ample reserves. In this regime, the Fed supplies sufficient liquidity to meet banks’ demand with money market rates close to the interest rate on reserve balances (IORB). The ample reserves regime has three main benefits. It provides robust interest rate control in an environment where both banks’ reserve demand and the autonomous factors that drain reserves are less predictable than in the past. The ample reserves regime also continues to effectively control interest rates when the central bank expands its balance sheet to provide macroeconomic stimulus or support financial stability. And, by remunerating reserves in line with other money-like assets, the ample reserves regime ensures banks don’t pay a penalty for appropriately managing their liquidity risk by holding reserves, the most liquid asset there is.\n\nAt present, liquidity appears to be more than ample. Reserve balances are around $3.2 trillion, compared with around $1.7 trillion in early 2020. The economy and financial system have grown, and the dash for cash at the start of the pandemic as well as the banking stresses in March 2023 may have led banks to increase their demand for liquidity. Still, I think it’s unlikely banks’ liquidity demand has nearly doubled in half a decade.\n\nOne sign liquidity remains in abundant supply, and not merely ample, is that money market rates continue to generally run well below IORB. The tri-party general collateral rate (TGCR) on repos secured by Treasury securities has been averaging 8 basis points below IORB. Because reserves and Treasury repos are both essentially risk-free overnight assets – and reserves are, if anything, more liquid – the spread of IORB over TGCR indicates reserves remain in relatively excess supply compared with other liquid assets.\n\nThe spread between IORB and the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR), which includes a broader set of Treasury repo transactions than TGCR, has recently been slightly tighter than the IORB-TGCR spread. However, some SOFR transactions include compensation for intermediating funds from the triparty segment of the repo market to cash borrowers who lack direct access to that segment. For this reason, I am watching TGCR for a cleaner read on liquidity conditions in secured markets.\n\nUnsecured funding conditions also continue to reflect abundant liquidity. The effective federal funds rate has been running 7 basis points below IORB and remains insensitive to short-term fluctuations in reserve levels.\n\nAnd the continuing substantial balances in the Fed’s overnight reverse repo (ON RRP) facility provide another sign that liquidity remains more than ample. The ON RRP facility accepts overnight investments from money market funds and certain other market participants at a rate currently 10 basis points below IORB. Thus, the facility reinforces the floor on money market rates created by IORB. Institutional and market frictions can influence investors’ choices to place funds in the ON RRP facility versus other instruments. However, should liquidity shortfalls emerge that create meaningful upward pressure on money market rates, I would expect market participants to move cash out of the facility in search of higher returns. For now, the remaining ON RRP balances provide a buffer of additional excess liquidity.\n\nWe have started to see some temporary money market fluctuations on statement dates such as the recent quarter end. As the supply of liquidity declines, the financial system needs to redistribute liquidity to the firms that need it most. That process isn’t always frictionless. The emergence of month-end and quarter-end pressures appears to reflect temporary intermediation frictions rather than shortfalls in aggregate reserve supply. For example, on September 30 and October 1, the spread between SOFR and TGCR widened by 7 to 12 basis points. This widening reportedly resulted from limited balance sheet availability at dealers that intermediate between the triparty and centrally cleared market segments.\n\nAs in the previous episode of balance sheet normalization in 2018 and early 2019, we are likely to continue to see occasional, modest rate pressures as our balance sheet shrinks. Such temporary rate pressures can be price signals that help market participants redistribute liquidity to the places where it’s needed most. And from a policy perspective, I think it’s important to tolerate normal, modest, temporary pressures of this type so we can get to an efficient balance sheet size.\n\nIn the long run, I believe it will be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to operate with money market rates close to, but perhaps slightly below, IORB. As I have discussed elsewhere, operating with money market rates close to IORB is consistent with the Friedman rule. In an environment where the central bank pays interest on reserves, the Friedman rule calls for making the cost of liquidity similar across markets and institutions by having roughly equal interest rates on reserves and comparable instruments such as repos. I say rates should be roughly equal because technical differences and minor competitive frictions between money markets can justify small spreads. The last time we normalized our balance sheet, in 2016 through 2019, money market rates became notably more volatile as they moved above the interest rate on reserves. A configuration of rates close to, but perhaps slightly below, IORB may provide the best combination of efficiency and effective rate control.[1]\n\nI also believe it will be appropriate in the long run to operate with only negligible balances in the ON RRP facility. The facility is a backstop tool to reinforce the floor on money market rates created by paying interest on reserves. The lower interest rate on ON RRP balances than reserves reflects the facility’s backstop nature. As such, meaningful ON RRP balances should not form a permanent fixture on the Fed’s balance sheet, in my view.\n\nON RRP balances came down rapidly in 2022 and 2023, but the pace of decline has slowed more recently. It is not particularly surprising that the most elastic balances would leave the facility first. The remaining balances may be stickier as some participants particularly value overnight assets or face counterparty risk limits for repos in the private market. I anticipate the remaining balances will move out of the facility as repo rates rise closer to IORB, but if they do not, reducing the ON RRP interest rate could incentivize participants to return funds to private markets.\n\nAssets\n\nTurning to the other side of the ledger, balance sheet normalization also has implications for our policy choices about the composition of the Federal Reserve’s assets and the design of our lending facilities.\n\nThe FOMC has said repeatedly, most recently in 2022, that we intend to hold primarily Treasury securities in the long run. At present, however, we are rather far from that benchmark and not moving appreciably closer. Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are running off slowly because homeowners have little incentive to refinance with mortgage rates higher than they were when we acquired most of the securities. Agency debt and MBS currently represent 34.4 percent of the par value of our securities holdings. That is actually up half a percentage point from the start of 2024.\n\nIn its most recent annual report, the New York Fed’s Open Market Trading Desk projected that the share of MBS in the portfolio would not decline materially until balance sheet normalization is complete and the Desk begins purchasing Treasuries to keep pace with growth in reserve demand. MBS would remain more than 15 percent of the portfolio through the end of the decade in those projections. As indicated in the minutes of the May 2022 FOMC meeting, a number of FOMC participants have suggested it could be appropriate at some point to sell MBS to move the mix of assets closer to our goal. But that’s not a near-term issue in my view.\n\nEven with a portfolio consisting primarily of Treasuries, the FOMC will face choices about which Treasuries to hold. I believe the two most plausible options in the long run are for the FOMC to hold a roughly neutral Treasury portfolio, meaning one with a maturity composition similar to that of the Treasury universe, or to tilt toward shorter maturities. A neutral portfolio would leave long-run decisions about the maturity composition of government debt to the Treasury Department, as is appropriate under our institutional separation of monetary and fiscal policy. A tilt toward shorter maturities would allow more flexibility. Either way, the System Open Market Account portfolio is significantly underweight Treasury bills, and its weighted average maturity remains significantly longer than that of marketable debt outstanding. The tradeoffs around how to move toward a more neutral portfolio are complex and will require thoughtful policy deliberations.\n\nLending and funding transactions\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s assets also include loans we make to depository institutions at the discount window and repo operations that deliver liquidity to our various counterparties. Balance sheet runoff will influence the policy choices on this component of our balance sheet as well.\n\nWhen reserve supply is closer to ample, individual banks will be more likely to face payment outflows that leave them temporarily below their desired liquidity levels. Money markets generally work well to redistribute liquidity in those circumstances, but frictions can arise. All banks should have strong contingency liquidity plans for addressing liquidity shortfalls, including those that private markets cannot meet.\n\nIn particular, as I have said before, I believe every bank in the United States should be operationally ready to access the discount window. That means completing the legal documents, making collateral arrangements and testing the plumbing. As a longtime market practitioner who has worked extensively on readiness for potential stress, I am convinced banks should practice using the window before a need arises. Take out and repay small-dollar test loans. And practice moving collateral between the window and other collateralized funding sources, in case a scenario arises where you can’t get the funding you want from those sources. The window is an important tool for healthy banks to meet their liquidity needs, but it works only when banks are ready to use it. Banks should also consider the potential benefits of establishing access to the Standing Repo Facility (SRF).\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s discount window policies have been largely unchanged for two decades, yet the structure of money markets and the banking and financial systems has changed dramatically over that time. The FOMC has moved from a scarce-reserves policy implementation regime, in which liquidity was costly and banks routinely experienced small liquidity shocks, to an ample-reserves regime, with much less costly liquidity and less frequent shocks. Regulations, especially for large banks, changed significantly after the Global Financial Crisis, calling for banks to manage liquidity risk much more carefully. Reforms adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reshaped the money market fund landscape, effectively requiring much more use of secured transactions and shrinking the market for unsecured short-term lending to banks. And in parallel with these policy changes, markets are moving faster than ever before, culminating in the unprecedented speed of bank runs that we saw in 2023.\n\nIn light of these environmental changes, it is important to consider whether our discount window operations and policies should adjust to ensure the window remains an effective tool for meeting depository institutions’ liquidity needs and mitigating liquidity shocks that could lead to broader financial and economic stress. Last month, the Federal Reserve Board issued a formal Request for Information seeking public views on how best to strengthen discount window operations. I hope all market participants will consider commenting. Your views are important and help us do the best job of serving the public.\n\nIn addition to the discount window, the SRF, the Foreign and International Monetary Authorities Repo Facility and international dollar liquidity swap lines are important tools for providing liquidity to the financial system when temporary needs arise. As with the discount window, it is important to ensure the continued effectiveness of these facilities as we move toward ample reserves. I was pleased to see the SRF drawn on over the quarter-end turn as market participants worked through frictions in the redistribution of liquidity. To further enhance the effectiveness of our tools, the FOMC could consider the benefits of centrally clearing SRF and other open market operations. Central clearing would reduce our counterparties’ cost of intermediating funding to the broader market. The SEC also adopted a central clearing mandate earlier this year for many private-sector participants in the Treasury market. While that mandate does not apply to the Fed, centrally clearing our operations on a voluntary basis could reinforce this important market transition.\n\nThe primary benefit of the clearing mandate, in my view, will be to strengthen risk management by applying the strong and uniform requirements of central counterparties, instead of leaving risk management up to individual firms. Broader central clearing in the private sector will also enhance transparency. And it may reduce balance sheet costs for some intermediaries, which could help mitigate the statement-date repo market frictions I discussed earlier. As the industry works to implement the clearing mandate, it will be important to design access models and operations to allow efficient central clearing by a wide range of market participants so that the mandate’s benefits can be fully realized. SIFMA’s work developing master clearing agreements is an important step to support the clearing transition, alongside the work under way at many other organizations. With the first clearing deadline at the end of 2025, it is crucial for all market participants to prepare.\n\nThank you. I would be happy to answer your questions.\n\nNote\n\nI am grateful to Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for assistance in preparing these remarks.",

            "content": "Good morning.\n\nThank you, Mark [Wynne], for the kind introduction. And thank you all for joining us for the second Women in Central Banking Workshop.\n\nMy colleagues and I are especially pleased to co-sponsor this year’s event with the Norges Bank. The Norges Bank began this workshop last year to give women working in PhD programs an opportunity to present their research, receive feedback and network with each other as well as accomplished senior economists in central banks. We’re delighted to partner with the Norges Bank on this year’s workshop and hope this effort continues to grow.\n\nThis workshop means a lot to the Dallas Fed. We know that to accomplish our public mission, we need the best economists in the world to become central bankers. So, we are incredibly excited and proud to welcome women who will lead the next generation of economists to our bank today to share their research.\n\nScholarly economic research is integral to the work of central banks. Research deepens our understanding of the economy and financial system and enables policymakers to make well-informed decisions on all aspects of our mission. Here at the Dallas Fed, we recognize the value of your work and how it helps us achieve our mission of building an economy where everyone can participate and thrive. And I may be biased, but central banks can be a great place not only to do research but also to make an impact on the world with your research.\n\nWomen’s representation in economics\n\nThis workshop is important because while more women are serving in leadership positions, they remain significantly underrepresented in the field of economics as a whole. This is a global pattern and, unfortunately, a persistent one. In 2023, women received just under one-third of the PhDs granted in economics in the United States. That figure has been stagnant for a quarter century. And in subfields like macroeconomics, finance and quantitative methods, which are crucial for central banks, representation among women is even lower.\n\nWhile the underrepresentation of women isn’t unique to economics, the field has made less progress than some other traditionally male-dominated areas of study. For example, from 1998 to 2018, the percentage of engineering PhDs granted to women doubled. And in fields like medicine and law, where women made up less than one-tenth of students entering professional schools in the 1960s, the percentages of men and women entering these same programs were nearly equal by the early 2000s.\n\nThe progress we’ve seen in other fields gives me hope that with the right strategies, we can move the needle in economics as well. However, I still have concerns about whether we in economics are missing out on top talent. As I said at the outset, we need the very best economists contributing to our mission. How many young women who could become great economists aren’t even entering the profession?\n\nWomen’s representation affects not only the individual talent in the profession but our ability to form high-performing teams. A rising share of economics papers have multiple authors, and I’ve heard it said that research is a team sport. That’s even more true for public policy.\n\nThroughout my career, I have seen time and time again when we’re trying to innovate or solve complex problems, we do our best work when we bring diverse teams together. The different perspectives that team members bring—how we think, how we analyze information and what we know about the world—allow us to generate better ideas and more rapidly develop the best solutions. Increasing women’s representation will bring new and important perspectives to the table—ones that matter for public policy and especially for our work as a central bank.\n\nCentral banks are among the largest employers in the field of economics. Research from my colleague Nitzan [Tzur-Ilan] finds that although the Federal Reserve System as a whole employs more than 1,000 PhD economists, women made up only 22 percent of these economists as of 2021. Here in Dallas, women account for just 25 percent of our PhD economists. Frankly, this is an area the Dallas Fed needs to work on. A diverse workforce is key to developing the best insights so we can build an economy where everyone can participate and thrive. My leadership team and I are committed to encouraging and supporting women in the economics profession and in this bank, and today’s workshop supports that goal.\n\nIn late August, I attended the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium. I look forward every year to this event hosted by my colleagues at the Kansas City Fed. It’s a bit like summer camp for central bankers—a time to discuss economics and policy with top experts from around the world.\n\nAt the very first Jackson Hole symposium in 1982, there was not a single woman on the program and precious few among the attendees. Over time, the organizers recognized that a substantial amount of talent wasn’t making it to the event and worked to include more women on the agenda and among the attendees. Today, one of the agenda items I look forward to most is a gathering of women leaders. Former Kansas City Fed President Esther George started that part of the program, and it’s been a key step in making the conference more inclusive.\n\nI am optimistic that with dedication and thoughtful efforts, we can bring more women into economics and central banking. From an institutional standpoint, this could include creating more diverse co-authorship networks, introducing mentorship programs, and building the pipeline in economics through efforts like the partnership we and other reserve banks have with the Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession to host summer interns. We can also make a difference as individuals, by identifying opportunities for our colleagues, inviting others to share their work and perspectives, and supporting one another. The issues we’re facing are long-standing and structural in nature, but as with the women’s gathering at Jackson Hole that I mentioned earlier, even relatively small steps in the right direction can help drive lasting change. Our hope is that today’s workshop will contribute to that progress.\n\nConclusion\n\nI would like to again thank Norges Bank for their partnership in developing this workshop.\n\nThis event would not be possible without the work of our organizing committee: Emilia [Garcia-Appendini], Eleonora [Granziera] and Kasper [Roszbach] of Norges Bank; and Lucie [Lebeau], Pia [Orrenius], Nitzan [Tzur-Ilan], Mark [Wynne], Fang [Yang] and Ziaoqing [Zhou] of the Dallas Fed.\n\nI would also like to thank everyone who is presenting, our session chairs and discussants. I hope each of you is able to connect, build your networks and advance your research.\n\nFinally, I would like to thank you for being here and for having me. Whether you are joining us today as a PhD student, as a central banker or as someone in the field, your involvement is meaningful and makes a difference for the next generation of women in central banking.",

            "content": "Thank you, Kunal [Patel], for the kind introduction. And welcome, everyone, to the Dallas Fed. I am so excited to be here today, to welcome my colleague Jeff Schmid, president of the Kansas City Fed, back to Dallas, and to welcome all of you to the Dallas and Kansas City Feds’ ninth joint energy conference. Thank you, as well, to the dedicated teams from Dallas and Kansas City who have worked so hard to make this event possible and to all of today’s speakers for sharing your expertise with us.\n\nBoth the Dallas and Kansas City banks have invested deeply in understanding the energy economy. Together, our districts empower the nation, contributing nearly 40 percent of the U.S. energy sector’s GDP. At the Dallas Fed, we’re committed to leading the energy conversation through our research at the intersection of energy and economics. That research includes academic publications, analysis, surveys and extensive engagement with industry leaders through our Energy Advisory Council, individual outreach and conferences like this one.\n\nOur research teaches us that the energy landscape is constantly evolving. This year’s conference, for example, will focus on how the industry is meeting rising power demand from users such as artificial intelligence data centers that were hardly on the radar just a few years ago. Dialogue with experts like you is crucial to helping us stay abreast of these changes in real time, and I’m so grateful to all of you who share your insights. As the energy industry evolves, the topics we study cover an increasingly wide range. Just this year, the Dallas Fed’s energy team has published analysis on topics from oil sanctions against Russia to the potential for new nuclear generation in Texas. I encourage you to check out our website to access our research, view our survey findings and even sign up to participate in our energy survey panel if your firm is eligible.\n\nBesides energy itself , we’re devoting more attention to the wires, pipes and pumps that move energy from its sources to wherever it’s needed. There is an enormous amount of energy in West Texas, for example—in the hydrocarbons under the ground, in the wind and in the sun’s rays. But whether that energy can move out of West Texas to meet the world’s demand depends on the capacity and resilience of infrastructure such as ports, pipelines, electric grids and liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities.\n\nAs part of my own learning about energy infrastructure, I recently visited some of our Texas ports and got to observe oil tankers and LNG carriers up close. Seeing these enormous ships in person brought to mind an essay I once read about how captains train to safely and effectively pilot them. [1] A key lesson was that the right way to maneuver a ship depends on the depth of the water. In shallow harbors, water becomes trapped between the ship bottom and the seafloor and drags along with the ship as it moves, making the vessel more difficult to steer. The faster the ship goes, the more water it displaces and the greater this difficulty becomes. Moreover, captains can’t always be sure precisely how deep the water is, because sometimes the depth finder registers mud on the seafloor as water. And so in water that’s shallow, or that might be shallow, captains learn to slow down, take their time and maneuver carefully.\n\nI may never have the opportunity to pilot a VLCC [2]—though if anyone here today can help me out with that, please see me afterward—but reading about this topic i sn’t purely recreational for me. These lessons also have relevance for me as a central banker.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has made a great deal of progress bringing down inflation and restoring balance to the economy. In light of that progress, I’ve supported the FOMC’s decisions at recent meetings to reduce interest rates toward a more neutral level—to dock the ship. But as the economy nears the harbor, it becomes more important to understand just how deep the water is. And with less room to maneuver, monetary policymakers need to be more prepared for winds and waves that could push us off course. Just like a ship captain, I think it behooves us to proceed cautiously at this point.\n\nIn the rest of my remarks, I’ll review the economic and monetary policy outlook, with an emphasis on how maneuvering cautiously and taking time to learn can help manage some key risks. As always, these views are mine and not necessarily those of my FOMC colleagues.\n\nThe economic outlook\n\nThe first time I spoke at this conference was two years ago, and as I’m sure you recall, inflation back then was much too high. The FOMC aims for 2 percent annual inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE. But as of mid-2022, prices had risen more than 7 percent since a year earlier. Soaring prices strained the budgets of families and businesses and had the potential to destabilize our economy over time.\n\nAt the same time, the labor market was incredibly strong—by many measures, unsustainably so. With companies adding jobs faster than the labor force was adding workers, wages surged. While those higher wages weren’t enough for many workers to keep pace with the cost of living, the wage pressures threatened to cause businesses to raise prices even more.\n\nThe FOMC responded by rapidly tightening monetary policy. We raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 5.25 percentage points from early 2022 through mid-2023. We also began running off securities holdings that we had accumulated to support the economy during the pandemic.\n\nThese measures helped bring the economy into much better balance. The most recent annual PCE inflation reading was 2.1 percent. Progress on inflation has been broad based; it’s not just a few outlying price categories that have cooled. You can see that in the Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate, which removes outliers and has fallen from a peak of 5 percent two years ago to 2.65 percent on an annual basis in September. At the same time, that 2.65 percent reading suggests we’re not quite back to price stability yet. While the Fed’s inflation target covers the prices of all consumer goods and services, measures like the trimmed mean that exclude volatile outliers can provide a better read than the headline number on where overall inflation will head in the future.\n\nMeanwhile, economic activity remains resilient, according to both national statistics and more timely but less formal reports from business and community leaders. The Dallas Fed’s contacts overwhelmingly describe a strong economy with robust consumer demand and fading downside risks. And the labor market has been cooling gradually, not weakening materially. Unemployment held steady in October, and although strikes and hurricanes brought payroll job growth to a temporary halt that month, job gains from July through September averaged close to estimates of the amount needed to keep pace with population growth.\n\nAfter a voyage through rough waters, we’re in sight of the shore: the FOMC’s Congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and stable prices. But we haven’t tied up yet, and risks remain that could push us back out to sea or slam the economy into the dock too hard.\n\nThe economy, of course, is subject to a wide range of risks. But I am paying particular attention to three that, in my view, pose the largest potential challenges for monetary policy in the months ahead.\n\nUpside risk to inflation\n\nFirst, returning inflation to target requires keeping aggregate demand in balance with aggregate supply. Yet strong demand persistently pushed real activity above forecasters’ projections in 2024. And the supply side of the economy, though currently healthy, has experienced unusually disruptive shocks in recent years. Both dynamics pose upside risks to inflation.\n\nIn late September, the Bureau of Economic Analysis issued its annual revision of the National Economic Accounts. Personal income turned out to be significantly higher than previously estimated. This finding helped explain why spending has been strong, and it resolved a mystery about the savings rate, which the data now show is at a relatively normal level rather than historically low. But higher incomes could also push consumption above current forecasts. The implications aren’t entirely clear-cut, however. If higher incomes and spending result from stronger productivity growth, they may not mean demand is moving out of balance with supply.\n\nI also keep hearing about a possible post-election surge in business investment. All fall, companies said they knew they were going to invest, but they were waiting to see the contours of fiscal and regulatory policies before deciding how to invest. With the election complete, some of that uncertainty is resolved. Just like consumption, a rise in investment could push upward on inflation.\n\nOn the supply side, I remain attentive to inflation risks from potential supply chain disruptions and geopolitical developments. The recent port strike was too short to leave a lasting mark, but workers and port operators have agreed to revisit their contract in January, so risks remain. Strains on electric grids represent another potential source of supply bottlenecks. I am also closely watching the conflict in the Middle East. As Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said, while the human toll is devastating, the Federal Reserve’s institutional role is a limited one: to monitor the economic implications. U.S. and global energy markets are somewhat slack, which has held down risk premiums in oil prices. But the potential for more significant disruptions cannot be ruled out.\n\nKeeping inflation under control also requires well-anchored inflation expectations. Market-based measures of shorter-term inflation compensation have been volatile recently, although longer-term measures remain consistent with the FOMC’s 2 percent goal. If inflation expectations were to become unanchored, the upside risks would only increase.\n\nIn coming months, we’ll learn more about how inflation expectations are evolving and how the supply-side risks and consumption and investment are playing out—information that will be valuable for shaping monetary policy.\n\nDownside risk to employment\n\nA second key risk relates to employment. I’m not taking too much signal from the dismal October payrolls print of just 12,000 net jobs added nationwide. It’s too hard to tell how hurricanes influenced that number.\n\nMy base case is that the labor market is close to balanced and stable or cooling gradually. That judgment reflects the stable unemployment rate in recent months; the slowdown in job openings, quits and compensation; and positive reports from the Dallas Fed’s business contacts. For instance, employment at temporary help services has been sagging in the national statistics. Weak temp employment can sometimes be a leading indicator of a downturn. But when our team called staffing firms to check on the situation, they told us the statistics reflect post-pandemic normalization and competition from gig-work platforms, not a broader deterioration in the labor market.\n\nStill, I’m not ready to rule out more damaging decreases in employment. Some labor market indicators still show a bit of underlying weakness. The Bureau of Labor Statistics revised down its estimates of payroll job growth for August and September, and you can’t wave off those revisions as the results of hurricanes and strikes that hadn’t yet happened.\n\nFinancial conditions represent another source of concern about the employment outlook. Monetary policy influences economic activity only indirectly, because while the FOMC controls the overnight fed funds rate, most households and businesses pay longer-term interest rates that also reflect their creditworthiness. So I closely monitor the evolution of those longer-term rates and other financial market indicators.\n\nSince the FOMC began cutting the fed funds target in September, the 10-year Treasury yield has actually risen by roughly three-quarters of a percentage point. Some of that rise reflects expectations for a higher path of policy rates. And, so far, higher equity valuations and tighter credit spreads have offset the tightening in financial conditions from higher Treasury yields. But a substantial fraction of the increase in long-term yields appears to reflect a rise in term premiums. Term premiums compensate investors for bearing the risk of future interest rate fluctuations. Higher term premiums can tighten financial conditions for any given setting of monetary policy and thereby slow the economy more than the FOMC intends. If term premiums continue to rise, the FOMC may need less restrictive policy, all else equal, to accomplish its goals.\n\nUncertainty about the neutral interest rate\n\nUncertainty about the neutral interest rate presents the opposite risk. Besides examining broad financial conditions, economists often consider whether monetary policy is boosting or slowing growth and inflation by comparing the policy rate to a theoretical level, the neutral rate or r-star, that would represent neither a headwind nor a tailwind. That neutral rate is notoriously uncertain and difficult to measure. But you can get a sense for it from economic fundamentals, models, surveys and market prices.\n\nA strategy of repeatedly lowering the fed funds target range toward a more neutral level relies on confidence that the neutral level is materially lower than where rates are now. When I look at the available evidence, though, I see substantial signs that the neutral rate has increased in recent years, and some hints that it could be very close to where the fed funds rate is now.\n\nStructural changes in the economy, such as the energy transition and advances in artificial intelligence, are prime drivers. These developments are fueling strong investment demand and potential increases in productivity. When you all, as energy experts, see a new LNG plant, a solar farm or a data center under construction, you perhaps see sources of energy supply and demand. As a monetary policymaker, I certainly see how these projects change the energy landscape, but what I also see—what you’ll perhaps see after today—is higher investment and a higher neutral rate.\n\nImportantly, uncertainty about the neutral rate has also risen, perhaps because the structural changes in the economy are relatively recent and will take time to fully assess. The FOMC’s own projections display the uncertainty. Four times a year, we release our projections for the fed funds rate as well as unemployment, inflation and GDP growth. Around the FOMC table, participants’ projections for the longer-run fed funds rate now vary by more than 1 percentage point, compared with a spread about half as wide two years ago.\n\nEconomists employ a range of models to try to estimate the neutral rate. Like estimates from policymakers and from market participants who fill out surveys, the output of these models ranges widely. Among widely consulted models, point estimates of the neutral real interest rate currently range from 0.74 percent to 2.60 percent. Adding in the 2 percent inflation target, those figures correspond to a neutral fed funds rate of 2.74 to 4.60 percent. Following last week’s rate cut, the fed funds rate stands today at 4.58 percent, right at the top of that range.\n\nNow, I don’t know which estimate is right. Time will tell as the economy evolves and we see how much of a headwind or tailwind the policy stance generates. But when policymakers look at mid-range estimates that suggest there’s meaningful room to cut before reaching neutral, I think we should recall the technique of a ship captain whose depth finder might mistake mud for water. If we cut too far, past neutral, inflation could reaccelerate and the FOMC could need to reverse direction. In these uncertain but potentially very shallow waters, I believe it’s best to proceed with caution.\n\nConclusion\n\nLet me conclude. Economic activity is strong, inflation is coming down and the economy is approaching a point that can sustainably deliver both maximum employment and stable prices. I anticipate the FOMC will most likely need more rate cuts to finish the journey. But it’s difficult to be sure how many cuts may be needed and how soon they may need to happen. I am keeping an open mind, scrutinizing economic data and financial conditions, and listening carefully to business and community contacts as I assess what next steps may be appropriate for monetary policy.\n\nThank you for your attention and for joining us today. I look forward to learning from all of you during today’s discussions and to continued engagement with you about both energy topics and the broader economy.\n\nNotes\n\nI am grateful to Sam Schulhofer-Wohl and Rebecca Zarutskie for assistance in preparing these remarks.",

            "content": "Thank you for the kind introduction, Imène [Rahmouni-Rousseau]. It’s great to see so many old friends, and it’s a real honor to give a keynote address at this important conference.\n\nAs a policymaker, I have the opportunity to speak on a wide range of topics, but money markets are where I grew up as a central banker. So it’s a particular pleasure to take a deep dive into the more technical aspects of monetary policy implementation and to do so from the perspective of a policymaker rather than a practitioner.\n\nLet me note that the views I express are mine and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nIn recent decades, central banks around the world have been shifting toward floor systems for monetary policy implementation. That shift has been motivated by the actions central banks had to take in response to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and subsequent stress episodes; by a growing appreciation of the benefits of floor systems across a wide range of economic and financial environments; and by post-GFC changes in bank regulations and banks’ own risk management, which increased the demand for liquidity and the costs of interbank transactions.\n\nAmong the key benefits typically cited for floor systems is that they do not put a price on liquidity. That is, in a floor system, banks’ demand for central bank reserves is satisfied at something close to market interest rates. Market rates are not materially higher than the remuneration on the marginal dollar of reserves, and correspondingly there is no incentive for banks to economize on reserves, the most liquid asset in the financial system.\n\nAs a result, floor systems satisfy a version of the Friedman rule.[1] The opportunity cost to banks of holding reserves is approximately equal to the central bank’s cost of supplying reserves, which most analysts view as small.[2]\n\nIn theory, because floor systems remove incentives to economize on liquidity, they should reduce liquidity risk in the financial system. Yet, in economies around the world that use floor systems, we have seen serious liquidity strains in recent years.\n\nThese episodes include the pressures on liability-driven investment funds in the U.K.; the banking challenges in the U.S. earlier this year; the repo market pressures in 2019; and, of course, the global dash for cash at the onset of the pandemic.\n\nIn light of these events, some observers have questioned whether floor systems deliver the promised liquidity benefits. Some have even argued that floor systems make liquidity risk worse—an idea I strongly disagree with. And some have questioned the other side of the Friedman rule equation, asking whether central banks can in fact supply large quantities of reserves at minimal cost to the financial system and society.[3]\n\nToday, I will take on both sides of those critiques. I will argue that floor systems do reduce liquidity risk. But they don’t eliminate it. It remains incumbent on all players in the financial system—banks, other market participants, as well as central banks in our roles as both regulators and financial institutions—to appropriately manage liquidity risk. The appropriate strategies to manage liquidity risk look somewhat different in a floor system, and I think all players have work left to do to fully gain the benefits of these systems.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, the costs of supplying reserves, it’s important to distinguish between two types of floor systems. When the central bank’s balance sheet is only as large as needed to meet the demand for liabilities such as reserves and currency, we call the system a liability-driven floor. That’s the approach we’ve selected for the long run in the United States, where our long-run operating regime will supply “ample” reserves. The FOMC deliberated long and hard over the word “ample,” and it contrasts with words like “abundant” and “super-abundant” that describe higher levels of reserves.[4] I don’t see large costs of supplying the quantity of reserves needed to establish a liability-driven floor.\n\nThere are also circumstances, such as the pandemic, in which it is appropriate for central banks to acquire additional assets to provide monetary accommodation or address severe strains in market functioning. Such balance sheet expansions create an asset-driven floor system. Asset-driven floors can pose some challenges. We can mitigate these challenges when circumstances make asset purchases appropriate, but it is better to minimize the challenges when we can. That is one reason I think it’s important to continue normalizing the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. (Another reason, of course, is that we need to remove monetary accommodation to restore price stability.)\n\n\n\nLet’s begin by fixing ideas: What is a floor system? And how does it implement monetary policy?\n\nTo answer these questions, we need to consider reserves’ special role in the financial system. Reserves are funds that commercial banks, and sometimes other financial institutions, hold in accounts at the central bank. Payments between banks, or between customers of two different banks, are typically settled by transferring reserves from one bank’s reserve account to the other’s. Reserves’ use in settling payments makes them a unique asset. Reserves are always and immediately liquid. Other assets may be viewed as highly liquid if market participants can usually convert them into reserves quickly and at low cost. But no other asset is ever as safe and liquid as reserves.\n\nBanks hold reserves for three main reasons. Banks use reserves throughout the day to settle payments. They may hold additional reserves, above typical daily needs, to manage liquidity risk by buffering against unexpected payment outflows. And banks may hold reserves to satisfy regulations and supervisory guidance, including formal reserve requirements, or as part of liquid assets to meet broader liquidity regulations. Banks’ liquidity management and the resulting demand for reserves have evolved significantly since the Global Financial Crisis, a point I’ll come back to later.\n\nWhen a bank holds reserves, it forgoes putting that money into other assets such as loans or securities that may have higher risk-adjusted returns. Banks, individually and in the aggregate, therefore have a downward-sloping demand curve for reserves (Figure 1). At relatively low aggregate levels of reserves, banks are willing to tolerate a large spread between the returns on other assets and the return on reserves. As reserve levels increase, the spread between the returns on other assets and reserves must decrease. And when reserves reach levels that satisfy banks’ demand for liquid balances, the demand curve levels off with a market interest rate close to the interest rate the central bank pays on reserves.\n\nThere are two ways for the central bank to implement monetary policy in this environment.\n\nThe central bank can provide a relatively limited—but potentially still quite large—supply of reserves, intersecting with the steep part of the demand curve (Figure 2). The central bank must then adjust reserve supply so the market clears at the desired interest rate. Small changes to the supply or demand for reserves can lead to significant changes in the policy rate in this regime.\n\nAlternatively, the central bank can provide more reserves and vary the interest rate on reserves to influence the market interest rate (Figure 3). Such an operating regime is called a floor system because the interest rate on reserves is intended to create a floor below money market rates. Commercial banks will not generally want to earn less in money markets than they can earn by keeping cash at the central bank.\n\nHowever, the floor provided by interest on reserves can be soft if some money market participants are ineligible to hold interest-bearing reserve accounts or if commercial banks face costs of expanding their balance sheets. That’s why I’ve drawn the graph with the reserve demand curve dipping below the interest rate on reserves. To establish a firm floor, central banks may need additional tools. The overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility serves this purpose for the Fed.\n\nThe level of reserves in a floor system might not be much larger than the level of reserves needed to implement policy on the steep part of the demand curve. Post-GFC changes in regulations and banks’ liquidity risk management have substantially increased banks’ reserve demand.\n\nAs I see it, floor systems have three main benefits.\n\nFirst, rate control in floor systems is more robust.[5] Since the Global Financial Crisis, both the supply of and the demand for reserves can be subject to much larger daily shocks. For example, in the U.S., the Treasury Department, other official entities and central counterparties hold accounts at the Fed that can drain reserves from the banking system.\n\nAs this chart in Figure 4 of daily changes in the Treasury General Account illustrates, the supply of reserves can regularly swing by tens of billions of dollars in a few days because of factors such as fiscal flows. And on the demand side, changes in liquidity regulations and risk management since the GFC have made banks’ demand for reserves less predictable.\n\nControlling money market rates requires absorbing these shocks to supply and demand. In a floor system, this is relatively straightforward. If the central bank operates on the flat part of the reserve demand curve, the system will remain on the flat part even after typical shifts of demand or supply, and money market rates won’t change much. By contrast, in a scarce reserves system, the central bank must actively manage the supply of reserves to offset the shocks—a challenging task when the shocks are difficult to predict.[6]\n\nSecond, floor systems continue to effectively control rates when the central bank expands its balance sheet to provide macroeconomic stimulus or support financial stability. In the United States, we saw this benefit most recently at the onset of the pandemic. The FOMC responded to disruptions in market functioning by purchasing Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities at an unprecedented pace and scale.[7] Cumulatively, the Fed’s balance sheet expanded more than $2 trillion in a few months (Figure 5). At no point during this balance sheet expansion did we have any difficulty keeping the effective federal funds rate within the FOMC’s target range.[8]\n\nBy contrast, when we rapidly expanded our balance sheet in 2008 in response to the Global Financial Crisis, we often saw the fed funds rate trade significantly below the FOMC’s target—even after we began paying interest on reserves, which proved to be only one of the components needed for a well-functioning floor system (Figure 6).[9]\n\nThird, and most closely connected to my theme today, floor systems eliminate what would effectively be a penalty for good liquidity risk management. As I said earlier, reserves are the most liquid asset, bar none. The banking stresses earlier this year proved the unique value of reserves beyond any doubt. Only reserves are immediately liquid. Monetizing any other asset takes time. And sometimes it’s difficult to do at all: counterparties may offer only limited balance sheet space for borrowing against assets, while selling assets can crystallize losses and impair an institution’s health. Holding reserves therefore reduces banks’ liquidity risks relative to holding any other assets.\n\nThere are, of course, good reasons for banks to hold assets other than reserves. By making loans, banks provide the credit to households and businesses that is crucial for economic growth. But banks should not pay a penalty for holding reserves when that is the right choice for their liquidity risk management. If the interest rate paid on reserves is meaningfully below money market interest rates, as occurs in a scarce-reserves regime, there is a penalty to banks for managing liquidity well. Floor systems eliminate this penalty and meet banks’ demand for reserves at market prices. This is the sense in which floor systems implement a version of the Friedman rule.\n\nThe question I now want to discuss is: If floor systems do such a good job of reducing the cost of liquidity, why do we keep seeing liquidity stresses? In the U.S., why did severe money market pressures in September 2019 cause some funding rates to spike by hundreds of basis points?[10] Why did the dash for cash challenge markets in 2020, and why did some banks face liquidity stress this past March? And across the Atlantic, what should we make of the liquidity problems that liability-driven investors in the U.K. experienced in 2022?\n\nMy answer is that floor systems reduce liquidity risk, but they don’t eliminate it.\n\nWe have seen concrete evidence that liquidity risk is lower in the floor regime. For example, since the Fed moved to a floor system, peak daylight overdrafts are about one-tenth the magnitude seen in the prior regime (Figure 7). And interbank payments are substantially less concentrated at the end of the day because banks are less likely to need to wait to receive incoming payments before making outgoing ones.[11] These are both signs that banks are not seeking to economize on liquidity as much as they used to. The floor regime has reduced the penalty for holding liquidity, as the Friedman rule recommends. So individual banks face less risk of lacking the liquidity needed to make outgoing payments, and the banking system as a whole is less vulnerable to disruptions from payments congestion or shocks late in the day.\n\nStill, there will always be some shocks that a floor system can’t absorb on its own. These can take several forms, including large shifts in the aggregate supply of or demand for reserves; idiosyncratic shocks to individual banks that exceed the system’s capacity to immediately redistribute funds; and shocks to nonbank intermediaries that spill over to bank funding markets. We saw examples of these types of shocks in the liquidity stress episodes I mentioned.\n\nI draw four lessons from these experiences: First, a floor system should include strong backstop ceiling tools. Second, market participants and central banks alike should ensure they are operationally ready to respond to liquidity pressures. Third, regulations should support strong liquidity risk management. And finally, some shocks are too big for any operating regime to absorb easily.\n\nFirst, ceiling tools. In September 2019, as the Federal Reserve normalized its balance sheet following the expansion during and after the Global Financial Crisis, reserves fell below what we later assessed to be the ample level. It was necessary to add reserves to continue operating a floor system, and that’s what we did. Market data, particularly related to pricing conditions, can help signal when reserves are becoming less ample. But given the uncertainties I discussed earlier, I doubt the risk of reserves falling below the ample level can ever be eliminated, especially if the central bank wants to have an efficient balance sheet with ample but not abundant reserves.\n\nSo, as a practical matter, central banks that operate floor systems must be prepared to respond to tail events when reserves fall too low and money market rates can rise above the target level. While discretionary operations such as those we employed in 2019 can effectively address such pressures, a standing ceiling facility at a backstop rate makes a better first line of defense. A standing ceiling facility transparently provides market participants with information about how the central bank will respond and confidence that the central bank will maintain rate control.[12]\n\n\n\nWe could study ways to further strengthen our ceiling tools. Such a study could examine how we can take on board the lessons of recent years as well as ongoing changes in the structure of the financial system. For example, the FOMC could further consider the potential benefits of centrally clearing SRF operations.[15] Central clearing could enhance the flow of funding to the broader market by allowing our counterparties to net funding received from the facility against onward lending to other market participants.\n\nOther central banks have considered adding counterparties to their liquidity operations.[16] These choices depend on a central bank’s charter and the financial system in which it operates. In my mind, the focus for the Federal Reserve given our context should be to enhance the effectiveness of operations with our existing counterparties.\n\nSecond, operational readiness. One criticism that has been leveled against floor systems is that when liquidity is ample, interbank trading may dry up and banks may become less practiced at sourcing funds when needed.[17] To the extent this happens, I don’t see it as a reason to criticize floor systems. That would be like criticizing modern building codes for reducing the risk of fire. If a city adopts a strong building code, fewer buildings will burn. Residents will have less experience escaping a blaze. Firefighters will have less experience putting out flames. These are good things. And while the lack of experience could have drawbacks, we know what to do about it: fire drills.\n\nSimilarly, the lack of daily liquidity challenges doesn’t absolve participants in the financial system from remaining ready should liquidity pressures emerge. A variety of flexible funding sources is available, and even in a floor system in which liquidity is usually ample, banks should be prepared to use these sources. During the banking stresses earlier this year, we found that some banks had not established access to the discount window, had not pre-positioned collateral so they could borrow against it, or had not tested the borrowing procedures. This is unacceptable in an era when bank runs can start in minutes on social media. Ceiling tools won’t work well if financial institutions aren’t prepared to use them.\n\nEvery bank in the United States should be fully set up at the discount window as part of its liquidity toolkit. That means setting up legal documents and collateral arrangements well before any funding need arises. And it means testing the plumbing—like a fire drill—so bankers have the muscle memory for borrowing when it’s needed.[18] The same goes for other contingent liquidity sources and for non-bank market participants.\n\nThe central bank, too, has a responsibility to maintain operational readiness in a floor system. The Desk regularly tests open market operations to ensure readiness to respond to a variety of potential stresses.\n\nThe Federal Reserve should also consider expanding the hours of critical services such as the discount window. With the launch of instant payments services such as FedNow, liquidity in the U.S. and other markets is increasingly a 24/7/365 business. Our liquidity backstop should be available whenever banks may need it. Over time, that could include nights, weekends and holidays, not just business days.\n\nAnd we should consider how our credit and supervisory policies affect operational readiness. A supervisory or regulatory expectation that depository institutions establish and test access to the discount window could help make individual firms and the financial system more resilient. Periodic testing by all institutions could also reduce the traditional stigmas associated with the discount window. And if we required banks to pre-position some amount of collateral at the window, we could reduce the risk that a bank is unable to borrow because its collateral is in the wrong place.[19]\n\nWe could also study ways to make our discount window, a fundamental central bank function, as strong and effective as possible. For example, we could consider the potential benefits of what I would call collateral-based lending. A collateral-based discount window program would lend to legally eligible depository institutions purely on the basis of their collateral.[20] In contrast, the current program of primary and secondary credit varies the terms of lending based on a borrower’s financial condition. Collateral-based discount window lending could strengthen the ceiling by ensuring all eligible institutions have equal access to liquidity against good collateral. It could also improve operational readiness by reducing the need to take time at critical moments to evaluate a borrower’s condition.\n\nI’ll now turn to my third lesson, regulations. Strong regulations are fundamental to a financial system that serves society’s needs. Regulations must also evolve alongside the overall structure of the financial system, the policy implementation framework and the risks that financial institutions face. Regulations that were well suited to a scarce-reserves regime and a world of relatively slow-moving liquidity demands are not necessarily ideal today.\n\nFor example, the Basel III leverage ratio counts all of a bank’s assets, including reserves, in the denominator. This rule can raise a bank’s cost of holding reserves and intermediating in funding markets, potentially working against the goal of reducing liquidity risk. Such costs may also add to frictions in the interbank market, reducing the system’s capacity to quickly redistribute liquidity to individual firms that need it.[21] More broadly, it is also important to consider the interactions among regulations, ceiling tools and liquidity risk, including how to ensure that banks are able to use their liquidity buffers and how liquidity regulations account for banks’ access to the discount window and the SRF.[22]\n\nFinally, the fourth lesson: some shocks are just too large. At the onset of the pandemic, market participants had to adapt to a dramatically different global risk environment while shifting to remote work. These developments triggered extraordinary financial market volatility, one-sided trading flows and demands for cash.[23] While improvements in ceiling tools, operational readiness and regulations could conceivably have partially mitigated the stresses, I don’t think any steps could have eliminated the stresses entirely. We should work to ensure the financial system is resilient and central bank intervention to support market functioning is rarely needed. But “rare” does not mean “never.”\n\nIn fact, the idea that some shocks are too large for a reasonable operating regime to absorb is built into the Friedman rule framework. The Friedman rule balances the benefits and costs of liquidity. It calls for providing liquidity up to the point that the benefits equal the costs—not for going beyond that point. Conceptually, it would be possible to further reduce liquidity risk by subsidizing banks to hold reserves instead of merely eliminating the interest rate penalty. But such a subsidy would have other costs. So we strike a balance and accept that some shocks will be larger than the regime can absorb without further central bank intervention.\n\nThat brings me to the costs of supplying reserves and the distinction between liability-driven and asset-driven floor systems. Ordinarily, the policy rate is a central bank’s main monetary policy tool, and the balance sheet plays a supporting role. The Friedman rule describes the optimal quantity of reserves to supply in those normal times: the quantity of reserves that banks demand at market interest rates. Because reserve supply is determined by demand for the central bank’s liabilities, this floor system for ordinary times is called a liability-driven floor. But a central bank may also use its balance sheet more actively in response to deep economic downturns or severe market dysfunction. When a central bank acquires assets for those reasons, it also issues more reserves, creating an asset-driven floor system. In such a system, the amount of reserves is not governed by the Friedman rule—the tradeoff between the liquidity benefits and costs of reserves. Rather, reserve supply in an asset-driven floor is a side effect of the central bank buying assets in response to severe macroeconomic or financial stress.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is currently in an asset-driven floor system as a result of our post-pandemic purchases. However, we are running off our asset holdings to return to a liability-driven floor. This is our second such normalization cycle, following the post-GFC normalization of our balance sheet in 2018 and 2019.\n\nWhy normalize our balance sheet at all? Why not stick with a higher level of reserves? In my view, there are two reasons to return to ample rather than abundant reserves—in the Friedman rule framework, two costs of supplying reserves above the ample level.[24] First, abundant reserves can distort the price of liquidity for non-bank market participants. And second, while acquiring assets during a severe downturn or in response to severe market dysfunction can provide much-needed support for the financial system and economy, holding the assets too long can undermine the achievement of monetary policy goals. In particular, maintaining overly large asset holdings may push inflation above target or may complicate the calibration and communication of the policy stance, which ordinarily should center on the policy rate.\n\nThe first reason is relatively narrow and focuses on money markets. Reserves can be held only by banks (or other institutions eligible for reserve accounts). Other financial institutions must use other instruments, such as Treasury securities, as their liquid assets. By acquiring non-reserve assets to back reserves, the central bank adds to the supply of liquidity for banks but may increase non-banks’ cost of liquidity. But in an efficient system, the costs of liquidity should be similar for banks and non-banks. Significant differences in liquidity costs imply that liquidity is too abundant for one type of firm or too scarce for another.\n\nOne way to test whether the costs of liquidity are similar for banks and non-banks is to look at money market rate spreads.[25] For example, overnight Treasury repo rates represent the overnight return on a Treasury security. If Treasury repo rates are significantly below the interest rate on reserves, then Treasury securities, the key liquid asset for non-banks, have greater liquidity value than reserves. The Fed’s balance sheet expansions in response to both the Global Financial Crisis and the pandemic pushed repo rates below interest on reserves (Figure 8).\n\nThese spreads indicated that liquidity conditions were more abundant for banks than non-banks. In 2018 and 2019, the gap closed as we normalized our balance sheet, and repo rates eventually stabilized a few basis points above interest on reserves. Repo rates and interest on reserves shouldn’t necessarily be exactly equal. There are technical differences between repos and reserves, as well as minor competitive frictions that could introduce a small spread. But in an efficient market, the spread should not be large. This argument is simply the mirror image of the idea that if money market rates are above the interest rate on reserves—if we move up above the floor—there is an undesirable penalty on liquidity for banks.\n\nSome researchers have taken the analysis of relative liquidity costs a step further by estimating the liquidity value of long-term Treasury securities.[26] In such models, the liquidity value of Treasuries includes a negative term premium associated with their flight-to-safety qualities. The central bank’s asset holdings influence that term premium, and one can attempt to calculate the level of asset holdings at which the liquidity value of Treasuries measured in this way would equal the liquidity value of reserves. But I am not persuaded that monetary policy implementation frameworks should be designed around this term premium. To the extent that long-term government debt is scarce, the Treasury can address the scarcity by changing the maturity structure of its debt issuance. When a central bank considers the costs and benefits of supplying more reserves, it should focus on the effects in money markets. Money market conditions reflect the liquidity value of reserves, a unique asset that only the central bank can provide.\n\nThe second reason for balance sheet normalization is outside money markets. Expanding the central bank balance sheet and acquiring assets makes setting and communicating the stance of monetary policy more complicated. The central bank must explain its use of two tools—asset purchases and the policy rate—instead of just one. And asset purchases are more difficult to calibrate because their effects are less certain. These challenges are worth surmounting when the policy rate is at the effective lower bound and further stimulus can come only through asset purchases, or when asset purchases are the best available response to threats to financial stability.\n\nBut in the absence of such needs, the benefits of higher reserves aren’t commensurate with the drawbacks. Indeed, a large balance sheet can even be counterproductive for our policy goals. The Federal Reserve and other central banks bought large quantities of assets during the pandemic for a reason: to support market functioning, the flow of credit and economic activity in response to a severe economic shock. Circumstances are now different. Financial markets are functioning smoothly. And our primary economic challenge is not a deep recession but rather too-high inflation. In this environment, it is important to remove economic stimulus by returning our assets to the level needed to supply ample—not abundant—reserves.\n\nCentral bankers have vigorously debated monetary policy implementation regimes for many years. And I have no doubt we will continue to do so for many more. The Friedman rule offers a useful guidepost in that debate. On the margin, central banks should equate the benefits and costs to society of supplying additional reserves. A floor system with ample reserves satisfies this criterion in my view.\n\nThank you.\n\nNotes\n\nI am grateful to Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for assistance in preparing these remarks and to Antoine Martin and Patricia Zobel for valuable conversations.",

            "content": "Thank you, Greg, for that introduction, and thank you, Julia, for inviting me to speak today. Good morning and welcome to Dallas and the Eleventh Federal Reserve District. It was great to see so many of you at last night’s reception and personally welcome you to the region.\n\nAs some of you may know, I am proud to have Pia Orrenius, who is just completing her service as a NABE director, and Roberto Coronado, who is starting his term as a director, on my leadership team at the Dallas Fed. Two of our former research directors, Harvey Rosenblum and Mine Yücel, have served as president of NABE. Together with my colleagues, I am working to continue the Bank’s thought leadership in economics. And we greatly value our collaboration and partnership with NABE.\n\nThe Eleventh District in 2023 is a highly diversified and globally connected economy—transformed from the heavy concentrations in cotton, cattle and oil as recently as the 1980s. The region has grown to include a sizable high-tech industry in Austin, solid manufacturing in Fort Worth and Arlington, a global energy capital in Houston, and a vibrant finance and professional services sector here in Dallas.\n\nIt’s been a little over a year since I came here as president and CEO of the Dallas Fed. In that time, I have visited with business owners and community leaders from small towns, oil drillers and solar farm operators in the Permian Basin, tech executives in Austin, and CEOs of some of the biggest companies in our largest metro areas. These conversations are so important because they provide a deeper understanding of the region’s economic landscape as we work to advance an economy where everyone has opportunities to thrive.\n\nIn diversifying its economic base, the Eleventh District has in many ways become more similar to the nation over time. The oil booms and busts that once ruled the region have diminished in impact, and the region’s business cycle looks more similar to the nation’s. But the region still has many unique features that set it apart from the rest of the country. The dynamism here is visible every day, driven by in-migration of people and businesses and adding to the economic growth that consistently outperforms the national average.\n\nUnderstanding the trajectory of our regional economy and connecting with regional businesses have been particularly valuable to me in my role contributing to the formulation of monetary policy on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Aggregate statistics can get us only so far in understanding the economy. They are often backward looking and subject to revision. Information from business contacts provides context on the reasons underlying economic developments. And reports from these contacts can be more timely than aggregate statistics, especially when the economy is near turning points. So, the Dallas Fed’s Texas Business Outlook Surveys and my conversations with business leaders provide a critical complement to the hard data. This has never been more true than in recent months as the economic picture has become more complex.\n\nToday, I’d like to share how I’m seeing the economic outlook and how financial conditions are influencing my perspective on monetary policy. As always, the views I share are not necessarily those of my FOMC colleagues.\n\nI remain focused on returning inflation to our 2 percent target. People count on the Federal Reserve to keep our commitment to price stability. When inflation is high, people’s incomes fall short of the rising cost of living. Businesses can’t plan well because they don’t know what they’ll pay for materials or be able to charge their customers. And, over time, high inflation tends to undermine the long and stable expansions that particularly benefit the most vulnerable in society.\n\nOver the summer, we saw welcome progress on inflation. However, the monthly inflation data have been somewhat uneven. Smoothing through the monthly fluctuations can give a more accurate picture. Of course, waiting to declare victory until 12-month inflation rates get all the way back to target would be a recipe for undershooting our inflation target. So, I see averages over three or six months as a sensible middle ground to watch.\n\nIn formulating my inflation outlook, I also focus on measures like core and trimmed mean that drop volatile categories and one-off factors. These measures typically give a more reliable sense of where headline inflation will trend.\n\nThe most recent release of the FOMC’s preferred inflation gauge, the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, showed some further improvement. Through August, the three-month PCE inflation rate excluding food and energy, or core PCE inflation, was 2.2 percent. The three-month Dallas Fed trimmed mean was 2.6 percent. Measured over six months, core has fallen to 3 percent and trimmed mean to 3.1 percent. These developments are encouraging, but it is still too soon to say with confidence that inflation is headed to 2 percent in a sustainable and timely way.\n\nThe labor market is also an important input to my assessment of the economic outlook. Employment is important in its own right as one leg of the FOMC’s dual mandate. And restoring balance in the labor market after the pressures of recent years will be important to restoring price stability and sustaining it over time.\n\nWhile the job market isn’t as hot as it was a year ago, it remains very strong overall. The U.S. economy has been adding more than 250,000 jobs per month. That’s significantly more than enough to keep pace with trend growth in the labor force. My Eleventh District business contacts continue to report tight hiring conditions. Of those seeking more workers, more than half still say a lack of applicants impedes hiring. Data such as the quits rate, the ratio of vacancies to unemployed workers, and surveys of consumers and businesses show progress toward better balance. Many of these measures are near or at 2019 levels. However, 2019 was a very strong labor market. Conditions like those of 2019 don’t necessarily mean labor supply and demand are in balance.\n\nAnd wage growth remains solid. Many national and regional statistics continue to show that wages are rising faster than would be consistent with 2 percent inflation in the long run, given typical estimates of trend productivity growth. In the Dallas Fed’s latest regional survey on labor costs, Texas businesses penciled in 5 percent wage growth for this year. That’s down slightly from the last time we asked the question. But higher labor costs are now tied with higher input costs as our survey respondents’ top reason for raising their selling prices.\n\nOutput and spending have come in surprisingly strong in 2023. GDP growth has been at or above 2 percent for the past year. Growth in the third quarter is tracking to be even stronger. The strength is broad based. Consumption is robust, business investment is solid, the drag from the housing sector has declined, and recession fears have faded.\n\nSome of my contacts highlight a significant increase in manufacturing and nonbuilding construction, both nationally and in this region. The number of manufacturing construction projects in Texas is the highest in 22 years. With so many projects in the pipeline, construction contract values are also at record highs. Some of this activity appears related to initiatives to spur clean energy, infrastructure and the domestic semiconductor industry.\n\nBut my business contacts do report mixed outlooks for the consumer. Some anticipate continued strength, while others are finding it difficult to pass through cost increases or are noticing softer growth.\n\nPutting all this information together, I expect that continued restrictive financial conditions will be necessary to restore price stability in a sustainable and timely way. I remain attentive to risks on both sides of our mandate. In my view, high inflation remains the most important risk. We cannot allow it to become entrenched or reignite.\n\nYou’ll note that I referred to restrictive financial conditions rather than to the setting of the federal funds rate. That’s because, while the FOMC controls the overnight fed funds rate, households and businesses usually borrow at longer tenors. Longer-term rates therefore influence economic activity more directly than does the fed funds rate. Yet the relationship between the fed funds rate and longer-term rates is not fixed. So, in setting the stance of monetary policy, the FOMC needs to account for how that stance will translate to the broader financial conditions, including long-term rates as well as credit spreads and other factors, that influence economic activity. In addition, broader financial conditions can contain important information about how market participants are seeing the economic outlook.\n\nFinancial conditions tightened substantially in recent months. Much of the tightening came from movements in longer-term interest rates. Higher long-term interest rates have also contributed to equity price declines and dollar appreciation over recent months. In the remainder of my remarks, I’ll discuss how I interpret the rate moves and what they might mean for monetary policy.\n\nSince the July meeting, the yield curve has steepened notably. The market-implied peak fed funds rate is little changed, and policy-sensitive rates through 2025 are 60 basis points higher. But the 10-year Treasury yield is up roughly 90 basis points, and the five-year yield, five years forward, is almost 130 basis points higher.\n\nImportantly, the rise in rates has come almost entirely in real interest rates. Inflation compensation has hardly moved. Market participants remain confident, as they should, that the FOMC will achieve the inflation target.\n\nA term interest rate can be broadly decomposed into the expected average level of overnight rates plus a term premium that compensates for the risk of interest rate fluctuations.\n\nConceptually, therefore, there are several reasons why longer-term rates may have risen. First, market participants may anticipate that the economic data will call for a higher fed funds rate target in the next few months or years. Second, market participants may judge that overnight rates will be higher, on average, over the long term, as a result of lasting changes in the structure of the economy or financial system. And, third, term premiums may have increased.\n\nA rise in term premiums can itself have many drivers, including increases in the stock of debt relative to investors’ demand for debt, changing correlations between the returns on different asset classes—which can influence the portfolio diversification properties of long-term bonds—and reductions in expectations for the Federal Reserve’s asset holdings.\n\nThe July FOMC minutes indicated that runoff of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet “need not end when the Committee eventually begins to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate.” In my view, while it is far too soon to think about rate cuts in our monetary policy strategy, there will presumably come a time when we are returning the fed funds rate to a neutral level from above. Normalizing the fed funds rate in that way would be entirely consistent with continuing to normalize our asset holdings. Additionally, the more than $1 trillion of balances in the overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility leave plenty of room to reduce our balance sheet without making bank reserves scarce. As market participants have taken on board these perspectives on the balance sheet, market expectations for the end of runoff have shifted out. In turn, the expectation of lower Federal Reserve asset holdings over time implies that other investors will need to hold more long-duration securities, which appears to be one factor among the many contributing to higher term premiums.\n\nThe decomposition of changes in yields into near-term rate expectations, long-term rate expectations and term premiums matters for monetary policy.\n\nNear-term policy-sensitive rates rose on a number of occasions in recent months in response to strong economic data. Market participants understand that, to the extent stronger economic growth poses risks to inflation, the FOMC may need to offset that strength with higher interest rates.\n\nEconomic data can also lead market participants to reassess their outlooks for the average level of overnight rates that will be consistent with achieving the FOMC’s goals over the long run. For example, the economy has shown surprising resilience over the past year in the face of sustained real interest rates north of 1.5 percent. I’m starting to take some signal from that resilience, not only about the rates needed to restore price stability in the next few years, but also about the rates that will need to prevail to sustain price stability and maximum employment over a much longer horizon.\n\nAnd higher term premiums have a different implication altogether. Higher term premiums result in higher term interest rates for the same setting of the fed funds rate, all else equal. Thus, if term premiums rise, they could do some of the work of cooling the economy for us, leaving less need for additional monetary policy tightening to achieve the FOMC’s objectives.\n\nThe persistence of all these changes also matters. If technical factors are temporarily raising term premiums, for example, monetary policy shouldn’t overreact.\n\nAlthough the decomposition of yield curve moves is an important input into appropriate monetary policy, calculating this decomposition is anything but straightforward. Surveys, term structure models, event studies and anecdotal information from market participants can all shed light on the decomposition. But each of these techniques requires critical assumptions, and they ultimately deliver mixed results.\n\nSurvey-based decompositions suggest a limited rise in expected overnight rates and a large role for term premiums. The simplest way to identify the expected overnight rate is to survey informed professionals. In fact, the New York Fed’s surveys of primary dealers and market participants ask this very question. A term premium can then be estimated by subtracting the surveyed expectation of overnight rates from a zero-coupon Treasury yield. In July, the median modal primary dealer expectation for the average fed funds rate over the next 10 years was just under 3 percent, implying a 10-year term premium of 80 basis points based on market rates at the time of the survey. The September survey has not yet been publicly released. But market contacts mostly say their expectations for the average fed funds rate changed little over the summer, suggesting a good share of the rise in longer-dated yields reflects increased term premiums.\n\nOf course, the survey-based approach has shortcomings. Modal expectations don’t reflect the distribution of risks. If that distribution skews up or down, the expected value of the overnight rate could differ from median modal expectations. Respondents to the Open Market Trading Desk’s surveys may not be representative of the market more broadly. And survey results tend to be inertial. Respondents may be disinclined to adjust their reported expectations until they have high conviction that a change is warranted.\n\nTerm structure models can overcome some of these drawbacks, but estimates can vary dramatically depending on model specification and inputs. Two commonly cited models were built by current and former Fed economists: the Kim-Wright model and the Adrian, Crump and Moench, or ACM, model. The Kim-Wright model estimates that about one-third of the increase in 10-year Treasury yields since the July FOMC meeting is from a higher expected policy rate path, with the other two-thirds reflecting higher term premiums. The ACM model, on the other hand, estimates a decline in the expected path of future short-term rates and an increase in the 10-year term premium of 115 basis points. That includes a roughly 55-basis-point increase since the September meeting. The marked divergence in signals provided by these two models underscores just how sensitive model-based results are to modeling decisions, especially over short windows. In this case, the key difference is that the KW model incorporates Blue Chip surveys of short rate expectations in the data used for estimation.\n\nA third approach is to evaluate whether yield moves on specific days or in specific time intervals were driven primarily by changes in the expected path of short rates or by shifts in the price of duration risk. Yield changes in response to economic data surprises or to Fed communications on rate policy might reasonably be assigned to changes in interest rate expectations. Yield moves on news unrelated to Fed rate policy might be chalked up to term premiums. This approach is subject to a great degree of judgment but can deliver ballpark results. My back-of-the-envelope estimates using this approach suggest that more than half of the total increase in long-dated yields since the July FOMC reflects rising term premiums.\n\nMarket participants’ perspectives can supplement these calculations. My staff and I are in frequent touch with contacts including investors and traders at pension funds, leveraged funds and other firms that are part of Texas’ growing financial market industry.\n\nPutting together analytic estimates with the information I have gathered through these channels, I see a mixed story. There is a clear role for increased term premiums in recent yield curve moves. But the size and persistence of the contribution are subject to uncertainty.\n\nSo, what does this mean for monetary policy? As I said earlier, inflation remains too high, the labor market is still very strong, and output, spending and job growth are beating expectations. I anticipate that we will need continued restrictive financial conditions to return inflation to 2 percent in a timely way and sustainably achieve our goals of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nFinancial conditions have tightened notably in recent months. But the reasons for the tightening matter. If long-term interest rates remain elevated because of higher term premiums, there may be less need to raise the fed funds rate. However, to the extent that strength in the economy is behind the increase in long-term interest rates, the FOMC may need to do more. So, I will be carefully evaluating both economic and financial developments to assess the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to deliver on the FOMC’s mandate.\n\nThank you.\n\nNotes\n\nI am grateful to Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for assistance in preparing these remarks.",

            "content": "Thank you for that kind introduction, Dom [Haskett].\n\nI was just at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium, where the Kansas City Fed gathers central bankers and researchers at Grand Teton National Park to discuss the latest global economic issues.\n\nVisiting the Wyoming mountains reminded me of being in the Girl Scouts growing up. I cherished evenings around the campfire with my friends. But you can stay up only so late and eat only so many s’mores. Eventually, you have to put the fire out.\n\nNow, as every Scout knows, when you put out your campfire, you must make sure it is “cold out”—so completely extinguished that you feel no heat when you touch the ashes with your bare hands. Any warm embers could reignite later.\n\nThe traditional way to make sure a fire is cold out is to pour water on it—lots of water—until you have eliminated every last bit of heat.\n\nThat is a good way to put out campfires, but I will argue today that it is not a good way to put out inflation. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is strongly committed to our 2 percent inflation target. After the unacceptably rapid price increases of the past several years, I’m not yet convinced that we’ve extinguished excess inflation. But in today’s complex economic environment, returning inflation to 2 percent will require a carefully calibrated approach—not endless buckets of cold water.\n\nBefore I go any further, I’ll just note that the views I express are mine and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the FOMC.\n\nLet me start with why we need to put out inflation. Congress has charged the FOMC with setting monetary policy to pursue maximum employment and stable prices.\n\nWhile the labor market is very strong, inflation over the past several years has been much too high. The FOMC aims for 2 percent annual inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE. But prices rose 6 percent in 2021 and 5.3 percent in 2022 and continued to rise, at a 3.2 percent annual rate, in the first seven months of this year.\n\nPeople count on the Federal Reserve to keep our commitment to price stability. When inflation is high, people’s incomes fall short of the rising cost of living. Businesses can’t plan well because they don’t know what they’ll pay for materials or be able to charge their customers. And, over time, high inflation tends to make the business cycle more volatile, undermining the long and stable expansions that particularly benefit the most vulnerable in society.\n\nTo help bring the economy into better balance, the FOMC has raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 5.25 percentage points since early 2022. We’re also reducing our asset holdings. The significantly lower inflation in recent months is encouraging. But lower inflation isn’t necessarily low-enough inflation. We have to ask whether monetary policy is now sufficiently restrictive to return inflation all the way to 2 percent in a sustainable and timely way or whether the FOMC still needs to do more.\n\nForecasts are inherently uncertain. My base case, though, is that there is work left to do.\n\nThe monthly inflation rate has been around 2.5 percent for the past couple of months. But monthly inflation data can be volatile, and extreme changes in prices for one good or another can also push the numbers around. To get a clearer signal of where overall inflation is headed, it’s helpful to filter out some of the more volatile prices. For example, we can take out the prices of food and energy and look at the core inflation rate. Over the past three months, it was 2.9 percent. And the Dallas Fed trimmed mean inflation rate was 2.8 percent over that period. These numbers indicate it is too soon to confidently say inflation will trend to 2 percent in a timely way.\n\nLabor market conditions also suggest we haven’t finished the job of restoring price stability. To sustain low inflation, supply and demand need to be in balance. Last year, labor demand greatly outpaced supply. Payroll growth and job openings soared. The unemployment rate fell to a half-century low. Today, some indicators, like job openings and the percentage of workers quitting their jobs each month, show substantial progress toward better balance. Yet, overall, the labor market remains very strong. For example, the U.S. economy is adding an average of about 150,000 jobs per month. That’s more than enough to keep pace with trend growth in the labor force.\n\nWage data show that many employers still have to compete hard to attract and retain workers. Wages nationally have been growing at an annual rate of more than 4 percent by a variety of measures, compared with 3 percent in 2019. Respondents to the Dallas Fed’s business surveys tell us significant wage pressures remain, though they’re less severe than a year ago. To sustain 2 percent inflation over time, wage growth will need to fall, or trend productivity growth will need to rise.\n\nMoreover, the early data for the current quarter suggest economic activity is picking up—contrary to expectations all year that the economy would slow down. Retail sales and real consumption both came in high in July. Residential construction seems to be rebounding from the effects of higher interest rates.\n\nThe initial data on a quarter can be noisy. The picture could change. But if stronger economic activity continues, it could lead to a resurgence of inflation.\n\nSo, if the job doesn't appear to be done, why do we need to proceed carefully? The economic outlook isn’t certain. Tighter financial conditions might slow the economy without much further action by the FOMC. And there are risks to doing both too little and too much.\n\nThe strong July data might be a blip. If the economy cools, inflation would be more likely to fall. The economy’s strength might not even be a bad sign for inflation if that strength reflects improvements in labor supply or increases in productivity.\n\nFinancial conditions also tightened noticeably in the weeks after the July FOMC meeting. The 10-year Treasury yield rose by nearly 50 basis points before retracing partway. And the average 30-year mortgage rate at one point was up 42 basis points, reaching the highest level since 2001.\n\nPart of these moves came in response to strong economic data. Market participants understand that the FOMC may need to offset economic strength with higher interest rates. If, as in my base case, stronger growth poses risks to inflation, the FOMC will need to follow through on that expectation.\n\nBut news unrelated to monetary policy also pushed market rates up. That means households and businesses face more-restrictive financial conditions for the same setting of the federal funds rate. To the extent that tighter conditions from this source persist, they should slow the economy and, potentially, require less additional tightening of monetary policy.\n\nIn this environment, the stance of policy needs to be calibrated carefully. Tightening too little would allow above-target inflation to persist. If high inflation becomes entrenched, restoring price stability could require much larger and more costly rate increases. However, excessively restrictive policy would also hurt households and businesses and might even lead inflation to undershoot our 2 percent target.\n\nA year ago, we were raising interest rates very rapidly—by 75 basis points at each of four consecutive FOMC meetings—to catch up after inflation had surged far too high. But the FOMC cannot safely throw bucket after bucket of cold water on the economy just in case inflation catches fire again. If we did that, not only inflation but economic activity itself would soon be “cold out”—which is not an outcome we want.\n\nSo, at this stage, I believe we must proceed gradually, weighing the risk that inflation will be too high against the risk of dampening the economy too much. You might say we need to drizzle water on the firepit and watch closely for signs that the coals are heating up again.\n\nLast fall and winter, we slowed the pace of rate increases to 50 and then 25 basis points per meeting. The slower pace allowed us to carefully assess the data and reduce the risk of an abrupt and nonlinear deterioration in the economy.\n\nWe further slowed the pace by skipping a rate increase at our June meeting before increasing again in July. And another skip could be appropriate when we meet later this month.\n\nBut skipping does not imply stopping. In coming months, further evaluation of the data and outlook could confirm that we need to do more to extinguish inflation. The FOMC will need to keep the water bucket close at hand, and we must not hesitate to use it as necessary. But we must also gather the necessary information to use our tools well. This carefully calibrated approach can help us to sustainably achieve our goal of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "Thank you for that kind introduction, Trish [Mosser]. It’s great to be back at the School of International and Public Affairs and to have the opportunity to discuss current policy challenges with you, Don [Kohn] and Guillermo [Ortiz].\n\nI’d like to begin with some thoughts on the economic outlook and the monetary policy response. These views are mine and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\n\nTo put it concisely, I remain very concerned about whether inflation will return to target in a sustainable and timely way. And I think more-restrictive monetary policy will be needed to achieve the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC’s) goals of stable prices and maximum employment.\n\nBoth inflation and the labor market came in hotter than expected over the first half of 2023. As of December, professional forecasters expected year-over-year core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation to slow to 4.3 percent in the first quarter of 2023, and the unemployment rate to rise to 3.9 percent. In actuality, core PCE inflation for the first quarter was 4.7 percent, and the unemployment rate averaged 3.5 percent.\n\nWhile the final data for the second quarter aren’t in yet, it was clearly pretty hot, too. Core and trimmed mean inflation measures continued to run around 4 percent—twice our target. Statistics like these that filter out especially volatile prices give an important signal of where overall inflation is headed. And while labor market indicators have eased, the overall pace of rebalancing remains slower than previously expected.\n\nThe economy has added an average of 314,000 jobs per month this year. Job openings remain far above the 2019 level. Layoffs remain low. There is no indication of an abrupt deterioration in labor market conditions.\n\nWage growth remains around 4.5 to 5 percent. The Dallas Fed’s business survey respondents expect roughly 5 percent wage growth over the next year, similar to what they expected at the end of last year. And they cite labor costs as a key driver of higher selling prices.\n\nSome people say a lot of further cooling is in store from lagged consequences of the rate increases the FOMC has already made over the past year and a half. I’m skeptical about the potential for large additional effects from this channel.\n\nThe lags have to be measured from the right starting point. Broad financial conditions matter more for economic activity than the policy rate itself. Of course, financial conditions respond to the policy rate and, in particular, to market participants’ expectations for the future path of the policy rate. And so, in the current cycle, financial conditions began to tighten in early 2022—a year and a half ago, and a few months before the FOMC began actually raising rates—as soon as market participants started to expect rate increases. The last major tightening in financial conditions came around the FOMC meeting last September, more than nine months ago. So, although some sectors of the economy will be slower to respond, we have already had a fair amount of time to see the overall effects of monetary tightening.\n\nMoreover, the housing market even looks like it may have bottomed out. Housing starts and home prices have trended up since January. Market rents had been roughly flat at the end of last year but rose at around a 4 percent annual rate in the first four months of this year. While housing inflation will likely continue to soften in the near term as a result of progress on rents last year, a rebound in housing would pose an upside risk to inflation down the road.\n\nThe continuing outlook for above-target inflation and a stronger-than-expected labor market calls for more-restrictive monetary policy.\n\nCredit conditions are continuing to evolve, but based on what we’ve seen so far, tighter credit conditions don’t seem likely to fully offset the need for a higher policy rate. While banking stresses captured headlines this spring, bankers have been cutting back on credit availability since the fall. And the Dallas Fed’s banking contacts say the main reason is tighter monetary policy, not banking stresses. So, at this point, I view credit conditions mainly as the result of the FOMC’s policy stance, not as a separate factor to adjust for. Moreover, banking stresses have calmed since March. Commercial real estate remains a risk, but not uniformly; the challenges are concentrated at some banks and some types of properties, especially office.\n\nWhile the Fed must remain ready to respond if banking stresses reignite, we have strong liquidity tools, and we know how to use them. Our actions in March showed that. These liquidity tools give us the space to continue setting monetary policy appropriately for our dual-mandate goals.\n\nI also don’t expect the near-term dynamics of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet to create liquidity pressures that would call for a change in monetary policy strategy. Following the resolution of the debt ceiling, some market participants argued that the rebuild of the Treasury General Account (TGA) balance—coming on top of the ongoing runoff of the Fed’s asset holdings as we return to a more normal level of monetary accommodation—would drain regional banks’ reserves, pose a new risk to financial stability and meaningfully tighten financial conditions. But that wasn’t my expectation, and it hasn’t happened so far. In the weeks since the debt ceiling was resolved, Treasury has issued more than $450 billion in net new marketable debt—mainly Treasury bills—to rebuild the TGA and finance government spending. As investors such as money market funds and foreign central banks buy that debt or lend against it in repo markets, they have pulled a net $340 billion out of the Fed’s overnight reverse repo (ON RRP) facility and foreign and international monetary authorities’ reverse repo pool. Those shifts have largely offset the $360 billion growth in the TGA through last week and, in combination with other balance sheet components, left reserve balances little changed.[1]\n\nMy base case is that most of the TGA rebuild will continue to come from ON RRP balances or from reserves at very large banks. We’ve seen over time that even modest yield differentials are enough to encourage money market funds to move balances from the ON RRP facility to T-bills or private sector repos. And large banks have excess reserves that they’ll likely be comfortable allowing to run off as the TGA grows. So, while I’ll be vigilant in case the balance sheet dynamics play out differently, a large drain of reserves from regional banks doesn’t seem like the most likely scenario.\n\nWe could still see some temporary upward pressures on money market rates over time as the TGA grows and the Fed’s balance sheet normalization continues. Banks can’t perfectly predict deposit flows. They may have to pay more for short-term funding at times as liquidity redistributes through the financial system. As long as significant balances remain in the ON RRP facility, I wouldn’t see such rate pressures as a sign that liquidity was becoming scarce. Rather, the rate pressures would provide the incentive for funds to leave the facility and move to banks. And the Fed would have plenty of tools for maintaining interest rate control in such a scenario, including the standing repo facility, discount window lending or a technical adjustment in the ON RRP rate. The balance sheet outlook should not affect decisions about monetary policy at this stage.\n\nAnd history has shown the dangers of central banks easing off too soon on inflation. We are all familiar with the consequences of the Federal Reserve’s insufficiently resolute response to inflation in the 1970s. And recently, a number of central banks have had to resume or accelerate rate increases after pausing or slowing. The example of the Bank of Canada is instructive. The Canadian mortgage market uses more flexible rates that result in faster transmission of monetary policy to the economy. So, uncertainty about lags isn’t complicating the economic picture as much there. As an open economy, Canada appears to be getting a read on the persistence of global inflation. And what they’re seeing, in the Bank of Canada’s words , is that inflation is “stubbornly high.”\n\nIn this environment, the FOMC needs to make policy more restrictive so we can return inflation to target in a sustainable and timely way.\n\nIn my view, it would have been entirely appropriate to raise the federal funds target range at the FOMC’s June meeting, consistent with the data we had seen in recent months and the Fed’s dual-mandate goals.\n\nBut in casting my vote, I was mindful of several factors. In a challenging and uncertain environment, it can make sense to skip a meeting and move more gradually. And as I said earlier, financial conditions matter more for the economy than the precise path of the policy rate. Financial conditions depend not only on how fast rates rise but also on the level they reach, the time spent at that level, and, importantly, the factors that determine further increases or decreases. So, my hope was that the overall package of communications coming out of the June meeting would deliver a strong signal to financial markets and meaningfully tighten financial conditions.\n\nAt this point, it is important for the FOMC to follow through on the signal we sent in June. Two-thirds of FOMC participants projected at least two more rate increases this year. Significant unexpected events could always provide a reason to change course. But inflation and the labor market evolving more or less as expected wouldn’t really change the outlook. To have confidence that inflation will return to target on an appropriate timetable, we need to see more than some continued very modest rebalancing.\n\nIf we lose ground in our effort to restore price stability, we will need to do more later to catch up. The rate increases we’d need to keep inflation expectations anchored in that scenario would be far worse for workers, communities, households, businesses and banks than more modest increases now.\n\nThank you. I look forward to our conversation.\n\nNotes\n\nI am grateful to Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for assistance in preparing these remarks.",

            "content": "Good morning. Thank you for joining us for the second day of our conference on technology-enabled disruption.\n\nThis is the fifth conference on this topic in a series organized by the Atlanta, Dallas and Richmond Federal Reserve Banks. And the conversations among business leaders, scholars and policymakers remain as dynamic and important as ever.\n\nThe disruptive potential of technology has been unusually noticeable just in the short time since the previous conference in the series last October. After many years of relatively under-the-radar research, generative artificial intelligence [AI] exploded onto the public scene last November with the release of ChatGPT and, soon afterward, a number of competitors.\n\nThese remarkable new tools are already changing how companies provide customer service, how software developers write code, how college professors grade essays and even how art is made. However, you will be glad—I think—to know that the Federal Open Market Committee’s monetary policy statements are still written entirely by humans.\n\nOne wonders whether, years from now, we’ll look back at the time between this conference and the last one as a critical turning point—a time when we first truly saw a technology that, with its capacity to perform so many activities once thought of as uniquely human, may fundamentally reorient the human endeavor. Or will it turn out, instead, that generative AI is just another tool, an important one to be sure, but no more profoundly transformative or disruptive than other important technological tools?\n\nIn the financial sector, too, the disruption of technology has been quite volatile. We’ve seen in recent months how the combination of the rapid spread of information and the speed of financial transactions in the digital age puts a premium on banks’ effective management of liquidity risk. To bankers in the audience, I’d highlight a message from remarks I made at the Texas Bankers Association last week. In this new environment, I believe every bank should be fully prepared to borrow from the Federal Reserve’s discount window and to test its use regularly, including moving collateral between the Fed and the FHLBs [Federal Home Loan Banks]. It’s a sign your bank is strong, manages risk well and is fully prepared to serve your customers’ needs.\n\nAs authorities continue to learn from the recent episode, it will be valuable to examine how supervision and regulation can best take operational readiness into consideration. For example, an expectation that banks establish and regularly test the discount window access could help make individual firms and the financial system more resilient. Unlike requirements for banks to hold more liquid assets, an expectation for discount window readiness would allow banks to engage as much as always in the traditional business of banking—taking deposits and making loans—that is so critical to our economy. Also, if all banks regularly tested their discount window access, the traditional stigmas associated with borrowing from the Fed would be further reduced.\n\nThere is more here the Fed can do, too. Looking forward, the Fed should also consider expanding the hours of operation for critical services like the discount window. Our liquidity backstop should be available whenever banks might need it. As liquidity increasingly becomes a 24/7/365 business, that could come to include nights, weekends and holidays.\n\nThis morning, though, I’ll focus on another aspect of innovation in financial services that hasn’t gotten as many headlines as liquidity stresses but may be more transformative in the long run. That is how the Federal Reserve is advancing innovation in payments. I’ll then turn the stage over to our experts on technological disruption. As always, these views are mine and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\n\nThe Federal Reserve operates part of the nation’s payment system—a mission that is sometimes less visible than our work on monetary policy, financial stability and community economic development but is just as fundamental to the strength of the nation’s economy.\n\nThe latest addition to the Fed’s payments infrastructure is the FedNow service—a new instant payments service that the Fed is developing and will begin to roll out in July. FedNow will enable financial institutions of all sizes, in every community, to provide safe and efficient instant payment services for their depositors. Through institutions that use FedNow, people and businesses will be able to send and receive payments in real time. Recipients will have full and immediate access to funds. And the service will be available around the clock and every day of the year.\n\nThroughout my career, increased speed has been a key theme in financial services innovation. Algorithms that trade in fractions of a second have replaced voice-brokered and open-outcry markets. The settlement cycle for stock trades shortened to two business days from three in 2017 and is scheduled next year to shorten again to one day. The special fleet of airplanes that moved paper checks around the country for processing has now been almost entirely replaced by much faster image processing, and the total volume of checks processed by the Federal Reserve is down more than 80 percent from the peak three decades ago as people convert to electronic payments.\n\nBroadly available instant payments are the latest step in this push for speed, both in the United States and around the world. Of course, wire transfers between financial institutions are instantaneous and have been possible for decades. But enabling consumers and businesses to instantaneously make direct payments to one another is much newer and potentially transformative.\n\nThe private sector has created a number of options for instant payments—including tools built on existing payment rails as well as entirely new rails.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the Federal Reserve has the public responsibility of ensuring payment services are available and accessible to all depository institutions. That responsibility has been central to our work on many forms of payments over time. And as the world moves toward faster payments, we are taking that commitment to this new type of service. I see our commitment to ensuring broad and fair access as increasingly important in maintaining a diverse, vibrant banking ecosystem amid long-term trends toward consolidation.\n\nFedNow will be the public option for financial institutions to support instant payments for their customers. This new payment rail will work alongside private sector rails, but the key is that this rail will ensure broad access. All types of depository institutions will have the option to use it—from the largest money-center banks to the smallest banks and credit unions in rural communities.\n\nSome of the use cases for instant payments are already familiar, like using an app to instantly split a restaurant bill with a friend or getting paid immediately for your work instead of waiting for a paycheck.\n\nBut those familiar use cases are not why I see FedNow as potentially transformative. What’s transformative is that broad access to this new service is likely to foster all kinds of innovations that we haven’t even thought of yet.\n\nWhen email first became available to the general public, it didn’t seem like such a big deal to many of us. We thought it was just fine if a letter or bill took a few days to arrive through the mail. But once email was widely available, we discovered the power of immediate communication. Similarly, I expect that broad access to instant payments will enable people to invent all kinds of valuable new use cases that, today, we may not even imagine. And I think broad access is critical here because those great ideas could come from anywhere—any bank or any customer.\n\nSo that FedNow can achieve that transformative potential, I’m focused on making sure it is indeed accessible to the financial institutions that want to use it. Many smaller banks use third-party service providers known as core processors to connect to payments services. The Federal Reserve is working with core processors and other third-party technology providers to ensure banks will have the support they need to use FedNow.\n\nIt will take time to get all of the nation’s depository institutions set up for a change of this magnitude. We are rolling out FedNow in July with some early adopters. And then we will continue working with institutions on a rolling basis. Broad access must remain the goal so the country can harness the full benefits of this innovation.\n\nLet me conclude by briefly previewing this morning’s sessions.\n\nAs we can see in the work of the Federal Reserve and depository institutions to create and connect to FedNow, technological innovation requires investment. That can be large-scale financial investment by a business. Or the smaller-scale— but still very meaningful—investment of a person working late, lonely hours to pursue their idea for making a better future.\n\nIn either case, investments in innovation are forward-looking decisions. They rely on the innovator’s belief that the investment will ultimately pay a return.\n\nMacroeconomic and global uncertainty can challenge that belief. In a world of pandemics, wars and economic volatility, one could forgive the innovator for being a little less confident in earning a future return. Yet a world of pandemics, wars and economic volatility is quite likely a world that needs more innovation—not less.\n\nThis morning, we will hear how business leaders and researchers resolve, or at least think about, that dilemma. Our speakers include executives from real estate, health care and banking, as well as scholars of firm dynamics, finance, economic growth, and research and development. It is a testament to the importance of research to the future of the economy that there are researchers who research research! I know we’ll all learn a lot from these discussions.\n\nThanks to all of our speakers for sharing your expertise with us. And thanks to all of you for joining us here today.",

            "content": "Thank you for the kind introduction, Chris [Furlow], and for inviting me to join you for this year’s conference.\n\nI understand the Texas Bankers Association is the oldest and largest association of bankers in the United States. This is very fitting for a state that has more community banks than any other, as well as regional and large banks that combine to form a diverse, vibrant banking ecosystem.\n\nI grew up in Versailles, Kentucky, a small town that really revolved around our community bank. Its loans were an engine for economic and community growth. But more than that, it’s where our soccer carpool gathered before going to games—and the bank’s name was on the soccer jerseys. The bank also invested in the town in so many other ways, like supporting our personal finance classes in school. The bank served the community and was part of the community. That early experience gave me a strong appreciation for how important banks are in our economy and how important it is to have a strong and diverse banking system.\n\nToday, I would like to speak with you about two topics. As a Federal Reserve Bank president and member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), I’m often asked for my views on the economy and monetary policy. I promise you I’ll get to that subject in a few minutes. But first I want to discuss the Federal Reserve’s role in providing liquidity to the financial system, particularly during periods of market stress, and what this means for your banks. Let me note that the views I share today are mine and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\n\nLiquidity provision is one of the oldest roles of central banks around the world and an original purpose of the Federal Reserve System. One of the first lessons we are taught as central bankers is that to prevent stress and address crises should they arise, a central bank should stand ready to lend freely against good collateral.\n\nWhen a central bank offers a liquidity backstop, it supports financial stability in two ways: by reassuring the public and by actually adding liquidity to the system.\n\nIn many cases, the mere availability of ample liquidity can reassure depositors, calm stresses and help private funding markets continue to function smoothly. The central bank may not even need to make any loans.\n\nAnd when reassurance is not enough, the central bank can relieve pressures by delivering more funding. Over the years, across many episodes of financial stress, loans from central banks have helped bankers meet the needs of their customers—Main Street businesses and households—when other funding sources were unavailable. For this mechanism to work, the funds have to get out the door of the central bank and in the doors of commercial banks. Practical operational details become critically important, and all the more so in an era when liquidity needs can arise faster than ever.\n\nA banker I know told me how his great-grandfather managed a run on their family’s bank in 1932. He got in the car, drove to Dallas, borrowed $40,000, brought it back to the bank, showed customers the cash, and the run stopped. The world moves a lot faster these days. And I am pretty sure you couldn’t fit enough money in the car, either.\n\nThe events this year at Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) are only the latest example of how liquidity needs are speeding up. We also saw an astonishingly rapid dash for cash in financial markets at the onset of the pandemic. Liquidity needs surged so rapidly that the Fed’s trading desk, which I led at the time, had to respond by buying more than $100 billion of securities on some days. And the rise of electronic trading has contributed to fast-moving shocks in securities markets.\n\nMany people have spoken about lessons learned from the recent banking stresses for banks’ risk management, supervision and regulation. If you haven’t yet read [Federal Reserve] Vice Chair [for Supervision] Michael Barr’s report on SVB, I encourage you to do so. It’s a careful examination of the bank’s failings and a transparent, candid and self-critical look at the Federal Reserve’s own role in the matter.[1]\n\nToday, I will look at lessons learned through a different lens: operational readiness. Operational readiness was a focus of my work leading the Fed’s trading desk for many years, and I believe it should be a priority for banks of all sizes in this era of fast-moving stress. I’ll share some thoughts on implications for banks, for bank supervision and regulation, and—in the spirit of a candid look in the mirror—for our own operations at the Federal Reserve.\n\nWhen phones can move money, and bank names can trend on apps on those same phones, bankers must look at contingent liquidity sources in a new light. The traditional ways to mitigate deposit flight, such as face-to-face conversations and phone calls to answer questions from depositors, may not be available in all instances. If you can’t borrow from a funding source with almost as much speed as your depositors can push buttons on their phones, it might not help you meet withdrawals.\n\nOne important funding source for many banks is the Federal Reserve’s discount window. The ability to borrow at the window can be particularly critical for smaller banks that lack access to broader capital markets, as well as for larger banks that could need funding late in the day when other borrowing relationships may not be available.\n\nWhen banks establish access to the discount window, they can also gain access to the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), which we set up in March to respond to the recent stresses. With backing from the Treasury Department, the program allows banks to borrow for up to one year against Treasury and agency securities.[2] We lend through the BTFP based on the collateral’s par value, even if rising interest rates have reduced its market value. This additional funding, beyond what’s available at the discount window, helps ensure banks can meet their customers’ needs.\n\nDiscount window loans are priced a bit above prevailing market rates—we call this a backstop rate—because we don’t want to crowd out private funding. For that reason, banks generally do most of their borrowing elsewhere. But nevertheless, I strongly believe that every bank in Texas and every bank in our country should be fully set up at the discount window as part of its liquidity toolkit.\n\nLegal documents and collateral arrangements for the discount window should be in place well before any funding need arises. A bank facing today’s potential liquidity challenges may not have the luxury of waiting for setup.\n\nAnd banks should test the plumbing. Take out and repay a small-dollar loan. Practice moving collateral between the Fed and other funding sources that you use, such as the Federal Home Loan Banks. Evaluate how the lendable value of collateral varies across funding sources. These steps sound simple, and they usually are. But you want to have the muscle memory, so they’ll be easy even on a challenging day.\n\nThe same need for readiness applies to other contingent funding. Well-managed banks maintain access to a diverse set of funding sources. Maintaining access means more than a general idea that you could access funding from some source. The paperwork needs to be in place, and the operations need to be tested.\n\nAs the authorities continue to learn from the recent episode, it will be valuable to examine how supervision and regulation can best take operational readiness into consideration. For example, an expectation that depository institutions establish and periodically test access to the discount window could help make individual firms and the financial system more resilient. Unlike requirements for banks to hold more liquid assets, an expectation for discount window readiness would allow banks to engage as much as always in the traditional business of banking—taking deposits and making loans—that is so critical to our economy. Also, if all depository institutions regularly tested their discount window access, the traditional stigmas associated with borrowing from the Fed would be further reduced. To be clear, healthy banks borrow from our programs all the time. In the first quarter of 2021, the most recent period for which data have been released, 388 depository institutions took a total of 818 loans from the discount window.[3] Periodic borrowing by every bank would make it even more clear that borrowing is not in any way a negative signal.\n\nIf we are going to expect more of banks, we must also expect more of ourselves as the central bank. Liquidity tools that are not ready to get money out the door right away might not help us fulfill our responsibility to provide a liquidity backstop for the financial system. To be sure, the Federal Reserve has taken important steps to increase our operational readiness.[4] For example, the Standing Repo Facility (SRF) and Foreign and International Monetary Authorities (FIMA) Repo Facility, which we established in 2021, automatically add liquidity to the financial system when needed.[5] That eliminates the need to decide whether to provide liquidity and, if so, how much, a step that slowed us down in the past. Banks are eligible to access the SRF, and I’d encourage you to consider whether this would be another helpful funding source for your bank.\n\nBut there is more the Fed can do. Some bankers have expressed concerns that our setup process for discount window access can move slowly. We hear you. Senior executives at the Dallas Fed are collaborating with our counterparts at other Reserve Banks to accelerate the setup process.\n\nLooking forward, the Federal Reserve should also consider expanding the hours of operation for critical services like the discount window. Our liquidity backstop should be available whenever banks might need it. As liquidity increasingly becomes a 24/7/365 business, that could come to include nights, weekends and holidays.\n\nAnd while I’ve focused mainly on banks today, we should examine our readiness to provide liquidity broadly in the financial system. Besides the recent banking stresses, we should consider experiences from the pandemic, the repo market pressures in September 2019 and other episodes since the Global Financial Crisis. And we should think about potential risks not yet experienced. We should consider how we can employ the full range of the Federal Reserve’s tools, including emergency lending authority, support for financial market infrastructures and open market operations. For example, the FOMC could further consider the potential benefits of centrally clearing SRF operations.[6] Maximizing the effectiveness of our liquidity tools is essential so we can maintain financial stability while also taking the appropriate monetary policy actions in today’s macroeconomic environment.\n\nIn the rest of my remarks, I’ll assess the economic outlook and describe how I think monetary policy needs to respond.\n\nInflation remains much too high. The FOMC aims for 2 percent annual inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, but prices rose over the past year by 4.2 percent—more than twice our goal.\n\nThis high rate of inflation challenges families and businesses in the short run, and it weakens our economy in the long run. So, restoring price stability remains a critical priority.\n\nNow, inflation in recent months has been lower than the worst peaks last year. The labor market has cooled somewhat. And activity in some sectors, such as housing, has slowed dramatically. The economy is not nearly as far out of balance as when the FOMC began raising rates 14 months ago.\n\nBut the question for monetary policy is not whether there has been some progress. It’s whether inflation is on track to return all the way to our 2 percent target and to do so in a sustainable and timely way.\n\nThe closer we get to a turning point in the economy, the more difficult it becomes to answer that question. The economy doesn’t cool uniformly. Some sectors can continue to boom even as others slow. And inflation may not fall in lockstep with hiring or output. So, we have to parse the statistics and qualitative information with even more care and humility than usual.\n\nI’m keeping an open mind and a close watch on economic developments as we head toward the next FOMC meeting in mid-June.\n\nAs of today, though, I remain concerned about whether inflation is falling fast enough.\n\nPart of the slowdown in inflation in recent months has been due to lower prices of oil and other commodities. But while it’s a relief to see lower prices at the gas pump, energy prices can’t keep falling forever.\n\nCore inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, has historically been a better guide to where overall inflation will go in the future. And core PCE inflation was 4.9 percent annualized for the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThat is higher than overall inflation over the past year, higher than core inflation in the previous quarter and much higher than the inflation rate the public is counting on us to deliver.\n\nThe picture is the same with other statistics that filter out especially volatile prices to get a better signal of where overall inflation is headed. For example, the Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate is higher than headline inflation, and the 12-month rate has leveled off above 4.5 percent in recent months.\n\nWe haven’t yet made the progress we need to make. And it’s a long way from here to 2 percent inflation.\n\nThe labor market’s continued strength appears to be contributing to high inflation. To be sure, some labor indicators are no longer boiling over the way they were last year. But the job market is still very strong. If it isn’t boiling over, it hasn’t cooled to a gentle simmer, either.\n\nLast month, the U.S. economy added 253,000 jobs. That’s down significantly from the rate late last year. But it’s still more than twice what’s needed to keep pace with the growth of the labor force over time. And the unemployment rate last month ticked down to 3.4 percent, tied for the lowest unemployment rate since 1969.\n\nLast year and early this year, job openings were another red-hot indicator. At one point, there were two openings for every unemployed person in the United States—a historic high. Today, the ratio has fallen to 1.6 openings per unemployed person. That shows some progress toward better balance, but it’s still well above the 1.2 openings per unemployed person in the very strong labor market of 2019.\n\nAnd while wage growth has moderated, there are hints that it might be leveling off at a relatively high pace. The Employment Cost Index and average hourly earnings accelerated a bit in the latest readings. And the Dallas Fed’s regional surveys show no clear signs of deceleration in wages.\n\nIf labor productivity tracks historical trends, wage growth of 4.5–5 percent just isn’t sustainable, because it isn’t consistent with keeping inflation at 2 percent over time. And without price stability, high wage growth may not even make workers better off. Taking home more dollars doesn’t do much good if your budget is stretched thinner and thinner.\n\nThis complex environment calls for watching the data closely, interpreting the data carefully and remaining flexible.\n\nI recognize the arguments that if we tighten monetary policy too much or too fast, we risk seeing the labor market weaken more than is necessary to control inflation. Those job losses would be very costly, particularly for lower-income households.\n\nI am also attentive to the potential for nonlinear and unexpected deterioration in financial conditions. We are still learning how much the stresses at some banks will affect lending and economic growth in the aggregate. The Dallas Fed’s latest Banking Conditions Survey, which was released on Monday, found that 48 percent of responding bankers tightened credit standards and terms over the preceding six weeks. That’s the most since we started the survey in 2017. But it is not a huge surprise. Bankers have been telling us since last fall that higher interest rates are causing credit conditions to tighten. And, even now, they say the main reason for the latest tightening is restrictive monetary policy, not stress in the banking system.\n\nAnalytical models that try to calculate the incremental effect of banking stresses predict only a modest further drag on the economy. Most calculations so far suggest an effect comparable to raising the federal funds rate by 25 or 50 basis points. And it’s worth noting that other aspects of financial conditions have eased since March. Still, the estimates from these models are highly uncertain. We have to be prepared to respond to a range of outcomes.\n\nFiscal negotiations and geopolitics could slow the economy, too.\n\nBut all of these downside possibilities are risks, not likelihoods or certainties. And there are upside risks as well: The data could come in hotter than expected, or other lenders could substitute more for bank credit.\n\nMoreover, if the FOMC doesn’t stay committed to restoring price stability, the public could come to expect persistently high inflation. A self-fulfilling spiral of unanchored inflation expectations would require much larger rate increases to stop. Ultimately, that scenario would be worse for workers, households, businesses and banks than the costs of tighter monetary policy today.\n\nSo, even as we consider how best to manage the risks, they must not stop us from doing what’s necessary to achieve 2 percent inflation.\n\nThe FOMC is committed to delivering a healthier economy, with maximum employment and stable prices. To me, because of the potential costs of unanchored expectations, the path to that goal runs through bringing inflation back to 2 percent in a sustainable and timely way. After raising the target range for the federal funds rate at each of the last 10 FOMC meetings, we have made some progress. The data in coming weeks could yet show that it is appropriate to skip a meeting. As of today, though, we aren’t there yet.\n\nThank you.\n\nNotes",

            "content": "Thank you to Odessa College and President Gregory Williams for hosting this gathering. And welcome, everyone. Let me note that the views I share are mine and not necessarily those of others at the Federal Reserve.\n\nWe Federal Reserve officials are famous, or perhaps infamous, for giving a lot of disclaimers, and a lot of speeches—but today we are here to do something much more important: to listen.\n\nI’m very grateful to our panelists for taking the time to join us, and I’m really looking forward to the insights they’ll share.\n\nListening to people in communities throughout the country is so important because the Federal Reserve’s work is all about advancing an economy where everyone has opportunities to thrive. To do that, we need a nuanced and granular understanding of economic issues, and we need to understand how everyone is experiencing the economy.\n\nMy colleagues and I at the Dallas Fed travel frequently throughout the Eleventh District to engage directly with a wide variety of business and community leaders. These conversations add color and insight to the economic statistics.\n\nBy combining perspectives from our contacts with rigorous quantitative analysis, we can develop a deeper and more-inclusive understanding of the economy and make the best decisions to serve the public. That was true when I led the Fed’s trading desk on Wall Street, and it’s even more true in my role here leading the Fed’s activities in Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico.\n\nThe Dallas Fed has done extensive research, for example, on the nearly 5 million young people in the United States who are disconnected from both work and school, the loss of potential this represents for our economy and the policies that can help opportunity youths reengage.\n\nBut I gained an even deeper appreciation of those issues after I met with city and business leaders in San Antonio who are working to solve them and with a young woman who had dropped out of high school but got support from a city center for opportunity youths and is now on track to graduate from college.\n\nHere in the Permian Basin, I’ve been meeting for the past couple of days with energy, business and community leaders. This morning, I visited an elementary school where a community partnership called the ConnEctor Task Force is working to provide better internet access. The statistics on the 39 percent of Ector County households that lack broadband access are clear enough. But the importance of closing the digital divide is even more clear to me after hearing from students how hot spots from the task force made such a difference in their ability to prepare for class. The Dallas Fed is providing capacity-building support and technical assistance to the task force through our digital inclusion initiative. While the scale of this challenge is large, I am inspired by community leaders’ collaboration to address it.\n\nIndeed, promoting the economic resilience and mobility of low- and moderate-income communities is a top priority for the Fed. So, in our conversations this afternoon, I’m looking forward to learning more about efforts to advance economic opportunity in the Permian through education and career readiness programs.\n\nI’ll also be listening closely to your perspectives on the economy. As you surely know, inflation has been much too high. The Fed has raised interest rates by 4.5 percentage points over the past year to bring the economy into better balance.\n\nTo assess whether we have made enough progress, I’ve been watching three markers:\n\nOver the past six weeks, I’ve also been closely watching the effects of stresses in the banking system—both on the macroeconomy and on local communities, especially here in Texas where small and midsize banks are so important. Smaller banks are particularly significant in small business, rural, middle-market, and commercial real estate lending. And to have a strong economy, we need a diverse, vibrant banking ecosystem.\n\nYour views on these economic and financial considerations will be a great help in interpreting the quantitative data we receive.\n\nThank you again for joining us for this important conversation.",

            "content": "Thank you for the introduction, Anil [Kashyap], and thank you for organizing this workshop and bringing focus to this important topic. I’m looking forward to sharing perspectives with Andrew [Hauser], drawing on our unique experiences in recent years as well as work that we led together for the Markets Committee at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).[1]\n\nI’m pleased that so many experts have joined us today to discuss central bank responses to financial market dysfunction. The repeated severe stresses in core markets around the world in recent years emphasize the need for two types of change. The public and private sectors must work together to enhance market resilience so that these episodes will be far less frequent going forward. And, to be prepared for those rare occasions when extreme stresses in core markets threaten financial stability or the macroeconomy, central banks must continue to develop the toolkit for mitigating dysfunction. Finding the best approaches will require a wide range of perspectives, and I’m looking forward to today’s conversations. Before I proceed, let me note that these views are mine and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\n\nCore bond markets, such as those for government debt, are crucial to the economy—not only because national governments obtain financing in these markets, but also because these markets are used for implementing monetary policy, provide a safe source of collateral and establish a benchmark yield curve that underpins financing for households, businesses, and state and local governments.[2]\n\nBreakdowns of trading and price discovery in core markets thus put a vast array of economic activity at risk. But I would emphasize that the type of dysfunction I have in mind is more extreme than merely low liquidity. I am referring, rather, to fundamental failures in the process of intermediating between buyers and sellers, or lenders and borrowers, and identifying a market-clearing price for their transactions.\n\nThe U.S. financial system has become increasingly vulnerable to core market dysfunction because the supply of intermediation has not kept pace with demand as the Treasury market’s size and complexity have grown.[3] Treasury debt held by the public rose from 35 percent of GDP at the end of 2007 to about 95 percent of GDP in late 2022. And a growing share of the debt is held by investors such as hedge funds and mutual funds that trade more frequently or rely on the ability to quickly monetize assets when needed. Meanwhile, primary dealers, which are major intermediaries in these markets, have not increased the balance sheet devoted to Treasury holdings and Treasury repurchase agreements (repos) since 2007—even in nominal terms. The rise of electronic trading has also shifted intermediation toward principal trading firms, which typically hold less capital with which to absorb shocks, and increased the pace at which market developments unfold.\n\nThese themes are similar globally, and core markets around the world have repeatedly experienced dysfunction that posed risks to the broader economy.[4] The source of each stress episode has been unique, and each central bank intervention has been crafted to address the specific problems of the day. Yet, despite the varied initial shocks, central banks have faced a common problem: how to support market functioning without undermining the features that make these markets so important in the first place.\n\nThat central problem is the first of three topics I’ll address today. I’ll then offer three guideposts that I believe should shape central bank interventions given this problem: transparency, backstop pricing and distinguishing support for market functioning from monetary accommodation. And finally, I’ll assess our March 2020 operations in light of these guideposts and draw out some implications for market regulation and infrastructure and for the central bank toolkit.\n\nCentral banks should rarely intervene to support the functioning of core markets, but when such interventions are needed, they must be effective. At one level, intervening effectively should be straightforward. Central banks have powerful tools and, in principle, need only deploy them in sufficient size. But at another level, it is not at all straightforward to intervene in a way that ensures core markets continue to serve their crucial roles in the financial system.\n\nAs the Inter-Agency Working Group for Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG) indicated in its 2021 principles for the Treasury market, good market functioning is multifaceted.[5] In a well-functioning market, participants can efficiently buy, sell and borrow against assets. These transactions take place at prices that reflect economic and financial fundamentals. And there are minimal price distortions due to technical factors, externalities or frictions between closely related markets.\n\nIf, say, a rush of sales in the government bond market overwhelms intermediaries’ capacity to absorb the sales and find buyers, it is straightforward in principle for the central bank to step in and purchase some of the assets. But such an intervention may create risks and spillovers that would undermine other aspects of market functioning. Excessive purchases might crowd out private buyers. Poorly calibrated purchases could also push prices—of the specific securities purchased or of other securities—to a different level than would prevail in a well-functioning market. By removing duration from the market, the central bank’s purchases could reduce term premia and create a degree of monetary accommodation that policymakers might view as inappropriate given the macroeconomic fundamentals. And the mere potential for central bank intervention may create distortions, especially if market participants become overconfident and do not appropriately manage their own risks.\n\nIn the end, an intervention that substitutes one form of dysfunction for another may not represent an improvement. The problem is simply that avoiding this is easier said than done, because an intervention that improves the market’s functioning in one respect may change incentives in ways that impede the market’s functioning in other respects. Yet, in severe circumstances, refusing entirely to intervene would put the central bank’s fundamental macroeconomic and financial stability objectives at risk.\n\nCentral banking is an imperfect art, often practiced under great time pressure and with incomplete information. So it is useful to have some guideposts to aim for in designing interventions in those rare instances when they are needed—though I do not view these guideposts as rigid rules that can or must be achieved in every instance.\n\nThe accumulated knowledge of central bankers and scholars provides a wealth of such guideposts. From my own experience, three stand out as particularly important for mitigating the side effects of market functioning interventions:\n\nTransparency is fundamental across many central bank activities. We must be transparent about how we carry out our responsibilities so that we remain accountable to the public we serve.\n\nAnd transparency has special importance for promoting smooth market functioning. By clearly explaining how it is designing and carrying out its operations, a central bank can help ensure that all market participants have an equal opportunity to trade and have equal information about how the operations will influence the market. This is a matter of basic fairness. It promotes diversity in the market ecosystem. And by reducing uncertainty about the central bank’s activities, transparency helps ensure that prices reflect economic and financial fundamentals.\n\nThe second guidepost, backstop pricing, is one that we also emphasized in the report Andrew and I led for the Markets Committee. If a central bank’s operations are out of the money relative to normal market prices, then, when the market is functioning normally, no one will transact with the central bank. And when the market is not functioning normally, transactions with the central bank will generally push prices back toward the normal level. Thus, the risks of distorting prices or crowding out private activity are mitigated. Operations at a backstop price will naturally wind down when market functioning recovers. And pricing an operation as a backstop helps to make it transparent and distinguish it from monetary accommodation.\n\nThe third guidepost, distinguishing support for market functioning from monetary accommodation, recognizes that central banks have multiple goals. A central bank’s tools for supporting market functioning involve lending against assets or buying them. These are the same operations that are used to provide monetary accommodation. But, while smooth market functioning is critical to good macroeconomic outcomes, the scale of lending or asset purchases that is appropriate to support market functioning may not be the same as the scale appropriate to support aggregate demand.\n\nThe need to distinguish support for market functioning from monetary accommodation is most obvious when monetary policymakers are trying to tighten financial conditions to reduce inflation. However, even when policymakers are trying to ease financial conditions to boost economic growth, they may benefit from the ability to adjust the amount of monetary accommodation separately from actions to support market functioning.\n\nThree years ago this month, the Federal Reserve took forceful steps to respond to disruptions in core markets at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among other actions, we offered up to $1 trillion per day in overnight repos with primary dealers, plus additional term repos. And we purchased Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) at an unprecedented speed and scale.\n\nThe scope and purpose of our operations evolved. In March 2020, with purchases peaking at more than $100 billion per day, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) said the program’s goal was to support smooth market functioning and the transmission of monetary policy. By June, as market functioning improved, we reduced the pace of purchases to $80 billion per month in Treasuries and $40 billion per month in MBS. The FOMC also changed its statement in June 2020 to say the purchases were meant to “sustain” rather than “support” smooth market functioning, and in September 2020, the FOMC added a second goal: to foster accommodative financial conditions.\n\nHaving led the Fed’s trading desk during this period, I may not have an unbiased perspective, but I don’t think there is any doubt that our actions succeeded in restoring smooth functioning of core markets. Still, it is appropriate to reflect on what the experience teaches us about how to better support market functioning in the future. The guideposts I just described provide a helpful framework for this reflection.\n\nRepos measure up nicely, in part because their duration is short and in part because they can be priced as a backstop to the monetary policy target. The offering of practically unlimited repos was also straightforward to communicate transparently. These characteristics minimize the potential negative side effects of repos. In fact, the side effects of repos can be so well mitigated that the FOMC decided in 2021 to make backstop repos a standing part of our operations through the Standing Repo Facility (SRF) and the Foreign and International Monetary Authorities (FIMA) Repo Facility.[6]\n\nHowever, repos do not solve all problems. Smooth market functioning requires both funding liquidity, or the ability to borrow against an asset, and market liquidity, or the ability to easily buy and sell the asset. Repos directly support only funding liquidity. Moreover, repos directly provide funding only to the central bank’s counterparties. A central bank’s ability to support funding liquidity for the broader market depends on its counterparties’ willingness and ability to serve as intermediaries, which may be particularly limited during stress episodes.\n\nThus, as we saw in March 2020, purchase operations can be necessary both to directly support market liquidity and to influence market conditions for participants beyond the central bank’s counterparties. But purchases can pose challenges relative to all three guideposts.\n\nMonetary policy does not provide a benchmark for backstop prices on longer-term securities, unless a central bank is engaged in yield curve control. In addition, the deterioration of market functioning in March 2020 reduced the reliability of market indicators that could have helped derive a backstop price.\n\nIn consequence, we offered to buy fixed quantities of securities, evaluating the offers received in a multiple-price auction against both market prices and measures of relative value. While this approach was extremely effective in addressing dysfunction, it was not easy to provide a transparent link between the operation sizes and the degree of dysfunction.\n\nMoreover, while our market functioning purchases aimed to affect the flow of transactions, we could not avoid also changing the amount of duration risk held by the private sector and thus having some effect on term premia through a portfolio balance channel. The resulting monetary accommodation was appropriate following the large negative shock from the pandemic. But it did blur the signals about how we calibrated the size of our purchases.\n\nTo me, this experience has three implications.\n\nFirst, because both actual interventions and the potential to intervene can have side effects, central banks and other authorities should strive to reduce the need for intervention.\n\nI’m pleased by the relevant authorities’ ongoing focus on enhancing Treasury market resilience. Importantly, the Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed to expand the scope of central clearing of Treasury transactions.[7] Research by the Dallas Fed’s staff highlights that expanded central clearing would have four key benefits: uniform risk management standards, reduced balance sheet intensity of repo intermediation, reduced settlement risks and improvements in transparency.[8] In addition, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority last month began releasing daily statistics on Treasury trading volume and average prices, while the Office of Financial Research has proposed to close gaps in the collection of data on bilateral repos—both steps that will enhance transparency in the market—and the Federal Reserve Board’s holistic review of bank capital standards is evaluating, among other factors, the effects of leverage ratio requirements on Treasury market liquidity.[9], [10]\n\nI am optimistic that with continued reforms, we can make core markets resilient enough that interventions to support market functioning will be extraordinarily rare.\n\nSecond, because repos typically have far fewer drawbacks than outright purchases, central banks should work to enhance the efficacy of repo tools. While repos directly provide only funding liquidity, improvements in funding liquidity can enhance market liquidity as long as the funding liquidity reaches the right market participants, whether as direct counterparties of the central bank or through onward lending from direct counterparties.\n\nFor example, in March 2020, some foreign official holders sold Treasury securities for precautionary reasons to ensure they would have cash if needed. Only at the end of that month did the Fed establish a temporary FIMA Repo Facility—since made into a standing facility—to provide funding to foreign and international monetary authorities.[11] Had the facility been available sooner, it could have reduced precautionary sales and thereby improved the balance between the supply of and the demand for market liquidity. Transparency about the availability of the FIMA Repo Facility makes our repo operations more effective and should reduce the likelihood of needing to employ purchases to support market functioning in the future. The SRF does the same for domestic counterparties.\n\nCentral banks can also enhance the reach of repo operations by reducing existing counterparties’ cost of intermediating to the broader market. For example, the FOMC could further consider the potential benefits of centrally clearing SRF operations, as several committee participants suggested in a 2021 meeting.[12] Central clearing would reduce our counterparties’ balance sheet costs by allowing them to net funding received from the facility against onward lending to other market participants.\n\nFinally, when purchase operations are appropriate to support market functioning, it would be desirable to have options for clearly distinguishing these operations from monetary accommodation.\n\nOne approach, following the recent example of the Bank of England, could be for a central bank to separately track assets purchased to support market functioning and sell these holdings in a timely way once market functioning has normalized—independent of the direction of monetary policy at that time. The expectation of timely sales would limit the asset purchases’ effect on term premia.\n\nBut this approach could be complicated if the central bank were simultaneously buying assets to provide accommodation. And even if assets purchased to support market functioning are held in a separate portfolio, there remains the difficult question of what price to offer for them—both to ensure purchases take place at a backstop price and to distinguish market functioning interventions from operations to provide monetary accommodation.\n\nTo see why this question is difficult, it’s helpful to start with some cases where it is less difficult. MBS are typically priced at a spread to comparable-duration Treasuries, for example, using option-adjusted models. Option-adjusted spreads vary within a relatively limited range when the market is functioning smoothly. It would therefore be possible in theory—though even this would be operationally complex, so I mean this only as a thought experiment and not as a policy proposal—to support the functioning of the MBS market by offering to purchase MBS at a much higher spread to Treasuries than the range that normally prevails. Such a backstop price for MBS would avoid crowding out normal private transactions in MBS and allow monetary policy and private market trading to continue to influence the Treasury yield curve. Similarly, if severe market dysfunction caused large deviations between the prices of economically similar instruments, such as two Treasury securities of similar durations, it would be possible in theory to establish a backstop price for one of those securities by reference to the market price of the other.\n\nBut this process cannot go on forever. Eventually, we will run out of other securities to refer to. There will be one last security, or one last core group of securities, for which we have no other reference price. As the philosophers say, it can’t be turtles all the way down.\n\nThere is, as I alluded to earlier, one case where the central bank has a price to use as a reference even for those very last securities. The Reserve Bank of Australia and the Bank of Japan have at times implemented monetary policy through yield curve control. In that case, the yield caps established by monetary policy provide a natural reference point for backstop market functioning purchases. But this example simply shows why choosing the reference price is so consequential. At least in some circumstances, it may require determining where the yield curve belongs, which is the opposite of distinguishing market functioning from monetary accommodation and of letting the private market discover the price based on fundamentals.\n\nSo, in the spirit of a research workshop, let me conclude with some questions for further investigation. How should central banks establish prices when they buy securities to support market functioning? What methods can be employed to establish a backstop price for some core securities by referring to market prices of other securities? How effective would this be? And are there ways to establish backstop prices across the entire yield curve while still distinguishing that operation from monetary accommodation? Turning to broader topics, what further innovations can make central banks’ lending tools more effective? And what additional reforms, besides the ambitious road map that the U.S. authorities have laid out, can further enhance market resilience?\n\nThank you.\n\nNotes\n\nI am grateful to Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for assistance in preparing these remarks.",

I appreciate the many ways the Dallas Fed has been able to partner with Prairie View, including the Summer Banking Academy Program, the many students who have interned at our bank, and the graduates who are now part of our staff. Thank you so much for this invitation to join you all at The Hill.\n\nWhile today’s event was marketed as “A Conversation with Lorie Logan,” I have to say I am extremely honored to be the one having a conversation with Dr. Ruth Simmons. Dr. Simmons’ influence and achievements are almost impossible to overstate. As a scholar, teacher and administrator at universities across the country—from USC to Brown to Prairie View—she has changed the lives of countless students. You already know the many ways she has broken barriers. To put it simply, when the New York Times quotes Toni Morrison describing you as “a bit of a miracle” and “an unusual combination of real politics and integrity,” you are providing a powerful example of leadership and service.\n\nDr. Simmons’ passion for education and her extraordinary career are deeply inspiring to me and, I’m sure, to all of you.\n\nSo, Dr. Simmons, thanks for having me today. Thank you for your service as a member and, now, chair of the Houston Board of Directors at the Dallas Fed. And thanks most of all for the incredible work you have done throughout your career to create opportunities for everyone to grow, prosper and thrive.\n\nWhen I think about what we do at the Federal Reserve, it’s all about advancing an economy where everyone has opportunities to thrive.\n\nAt the Dallas Fed, we describe our work as “Building a Strong Economy Together.” The Dallas Fed is one of the 12 Reserve Banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. We are the nation’s central bank, and we perform five functions to support a strong economy for everyone in the United States:\n\nA theme of my remarks will be that in carrying out the Federal Reserve’s mission, we make decisions for the long term. We try to do what is best and most sustainable for the economy over time, even when those choices are not the easiest to make in the moment.\n\nThat longer-term focus will be familiar to you as college students who have made real sacrifices to invest in your education and your future. And that focus is particularly important to me today because of the economic situation we are in.\n\nThere are many good things about the current economy. Unemployment, for example, is at the lowest level in more than half a century.\n\nBut today’s economy also has flaws. Not everyone shares fully in the benefits of economic growth. And the high rate of inflation is undermining living standards.\n\nIn my view, the imbalances in the economy are not likely to be sustainable for the long term. So I would like to share with you some thoughts on what it will take to get to a more sustainable economy, and the Fed’s role in that effort. As always, these views are mine and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nInflation over the past two years has been much too high. The FOMC aims for 2 percent annual inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, but prices have risen since January 2021 at an average annual rate of 5.5 percent.\n\nThis high rate of inflation challenges families and businesses in the short run, and it weakens our economy in the long run.\n\nPeople’s incomes fall short of the rising cost of rent and groceries, and increases in the cost of living have been particularly stressful for lower-income households. Businesses can’t plan well when they don’t know what they’ll pay for materials or be able to charge their customers.\n\nAnd the longer high inflation continues, the greater the risk that prices and wages rise just because people think inflation will remain high. Such a spiral makes the business cycle more volatile, undermining the long and stable expansions that particularly benefit the most vulnerable in society.\n\nIn sum, price stability is foundational for a healthy economy and labor market over time.\n\nNow, there has been some progress on inflation in recent months. But the question for monetary policy is not whether there has been some progress, but rather whether the progress will continue. Will inflation return all the way to our 2 percent target, and will it sustainably remain there over time?\n\nTo answer those questions, I find it helpful to break down some of the components of inflation.\n\nAs it happens, for the last three months of 2022, headline PCE inflation slowed to an annualized rate of 2.1 percent. However, a good bit of that drop in inflation was due to falling prices of oil and other commodities. Energy prices, as measured by the PCE price index for energy goods and services, fell at a 16 percent annual rate over the last three months of 2022. But while it’s a relief to see lower prices at the gas pump, energy prices can’t keep falling at this rate forever.\n\nCore inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, has historically been a better guide to where overall inflation will go in the future. And core PCE inflation was nearly 3 percent annualized for the last three months of 2022, which is significantly higher than the inflation rate the public is counting on us to deliver.\n\nTo better understand the challenge in returning inflation sustainably to 2 percent, we can break down core inflation into a few more pieces: core goods, which includes items like cars and clothing; housing services, such as rent; and core services excluding housing. This last category makes up about half of personal consumption and includes everything from health care to transportation to entertainment.\n\nCore goods prices fell at a 3 percent annual rate in the last three months of 2022, partially offsetting rapid increases in services prices. Goods prices dropped in part because supply chains were recovering from the disruptions of the pandemic. Supply chains can’t recover twice, so I don’t see 3 percent deflation in core goods as sustainable. It seems more likely that core goods inflation will move up to the prepandemic trend of zero or a bit below, which means we’ll need lower services inflation to sustain 2 percent inflation overall.\n\nTurning to housing inflation, during the pandemic, the demand for housing rose, pushing up rents and house prices. More recently, the housing market has cooled as interest rates have risen. Because rents adjust infrequently as leases turn over, it takes time for a cooler housing market to translate into lower measures of housing inflation. Housing inflation was still around 9 percent annualized for the last three months of 2022. But our research at the Dallas Fed suggests that housing inflation should peak later this year.\n\nThe larger concern is with services other than housing. Core services inflation excluding housing has been running in a range of 4 to 5 percent for close to two years, with little sign of improvement. You could say this is the core of the inflation problem.\n\nIf core services inflation excluding housing remained in its current range, while other categories returned to their prepandemic pace, total inflation going forward would settle much closer to 3 percent than to our 2 percent goal. And depending on how the U.S. and world economies evolve, inflation could be even higher. For example, the Dallas Fed’s business contacts tell us that China’s rapid transition out of zero-COVID policies could drive up commodity prices this year by more than what most people currently expect.\n\nBroad-based and persistent services inflation is not the result of special circumstances like supply-chain disruptions that will eventually go away. Rather, I see it as a symptom of an overheated economy, particularly a tight labor market, which will have to be brought into better balance for the overall inflation rate to return sustainably to 2 percent.\n\nThe labor market is important in its own right for monetary policy, given the FOMC’s mandate to achieve both price stability and maximum employment. But in addition, because services prices depend substantially on labor costs, the outlook for sustainably returning inflation to 2 percent hinges in large part on what happens in the labor market.\n\nThe job market today is incredibly strong. Last month, the U.S. economy added 517,000 jobs. By most estimates, that’s more than five times what’s needed to keep pace with the growth of the labor force. We shouldn’t put too much weight on a single report, which can be driven by one-off factors. But on average over the past half-year, the economy has added 350,000 jobs a month, which is still very high.\n\nAnother sign of strength in the labor market is that as of December, there were 1.9 job openings for every unemployed person in the United States. That is down only slightly from the all-time high of two openings per unemployed person last March. And it is well above the ratio of 1.2 openings per unemployed person in 2019—which was thought at the time to be a very strong labor market.\n\nThe strong labor market has been driving up wages, which have been growing at an annual rate of about 4.5 to 5 percent by a variety of measures.\n\nNow, your first thought may be that rising wages are a good thing. If workers are earning 5 percent more, aren’t they better off? But rising wages make workers better off only if workers can buy more goods and services with those wages. Most workers’ wages have not risen as fast as prices. So even though workers are taking home more dollars, their budgets are stretched thinner and thinner.\n\nOver time, to be able to buy more goods and services with their wages, workers taken together must produce more goods and services. In other words, labor productivity must rise.\n\nThere is a formula for this. In the long run, if companies’ profit margins—or, more precisely, capital’s share of income—are stable, the growth rate of prices will equal the growth rate of wages minus the growth rate of labor productivity.\n\nFalling profit margins could also conceivably contribute to lower inflation in the short run.\n\nBut for 5 percent wage growth to be consistent with 2 percent inflation on a sustained basis, productivity would have to rise at a 3 percent annual rate. Yet output per hour worked grew at an annual rate of only 1 and a quarter percent from 2012 through 2019, and there is little indication it has accelerated meaningfully since then.\n\nAbsent a dramatic rise in productivity, it seems likely that sustainably returning inflation to 2 percent will require substantially lower wage growth. That may take time. Respondents to the Dallas Fed’s Texas Business Outlook Surveys expect more than 5 percent wage growth in 2023, which is down significantly from what they saw in 2022 but still quite elevated. Wage pressures have moderated somewhat in the latest national reports on average hourly earnings and employment costs. I’d need to see a lot more data, though, to be convinced the labor market is no longer overheated.\n\nTo achieve better balance, labor supply will have to increase, or labor demand will have to decrease.\n\nLabor supply has been weak coming out of the pandemic. Early retirements, deaths and lingering illness from the pandemic have reduced the supply of workers. So have structural challenges like the lack of child care for working parents. And immigration fell to nearly zero during the pandemic, though it has since bounced back sharply. Beyond that, employers tell me that when workers are available, they often lack the necessary training or skills.\n\nAddressing the structural challenges is critical for the Texas and U.S. economies in the long run. Developing a larger, higher-skilled workforce will help support productivity growth and ensure we have a strong economy for everyone.\n\nAt the Dallas Fed, we’re committed to partnering with communities in our region and conducting research that can inform solutions. For example, our digital inclusion initiative is helping community leaders in South Dallas, Ector County, El Paso County and southern New Mexico find ways to expand affordable broadband internet access and digital skills training to bridge the digital divide. That will allow more students to complete online school assignments, more parents to access online job postings and more people to participate fully in the economy. Through our Advance Together initiative, we are also supporting public, nonprofit and business leaders who are transforming their local education and workforce systems.\n\nBut efforts like these take time. So when it comes to the current elevated inflation, the FOMC has to respond by tightening monetary policy to reduce demand.\n\nWhat do I mean by tightening monetary policy? The FOMC’s primary tool is the target range for the federal funds rate, an overnight interest rate. Since the start of 2022, we have raised this target by 4.5 percentage points, the largest one-year increase in four decades. In addition, since last June, we have been reducing our holdings of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities.\n\nBoth of these tools push up interest rates for consumers and companies throughout the economy. Financial conditions have, therefore, tightened significantly. The 10-year nominal Treasury yield has risen about 2 percentage points, and mortgage rates have risen nearly 3 percentage points, since the start of 2022. Importantly, in recent months, real medium-term interest rates as measured by the yields on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities have averaged above 1.5 percent. That is a significantly restrictive level given that most estimates suggest the neutral real interest rate is below 1 percent.\n\nIn moving forward with monetary policy, we need to manage two risks.\n\nThe most important risk I see is that if we tighten too little, the economy will remain overheated and we will fail to keep inflation in check. That could trigger a self-fulfilling spiral of unanchored inflation expectations that would be very costly to stop.\n\nJust last week, the Dallas Fed’s Research Department hosted some of the world’s leading scholars on the history of inflation. These experts had studied experiences with high inflation in the United States, Europe and Latin America from the 1920s through the present. They offered a wide range of views on macroeconomics and monetary policy, and it was a stimulating debate. A key lesson I took away was that when central banks aren’t sufficiently proactive in addressing high inflation, the road back to price stability is longer, the labor market is weaker, and the scars on the economy can last long after inflation is finally reduced. We must stay focused on bringing inflation back to target in a sustainable and timely way.\n\nAt the same time, if we tighten too much or too fast, we risk seeing the labor market weaken much more than is necessary to control inflation. Those job losses would be very costly, too, particularly for lower-income households.\n\nMy own view is that, given the risks, we shouldn’t lock in on a peak interest rate or a precise path of rates. After raising rates at a historically rapid pace during 2022, the FOMC decided at our most recent meeting to increase rates by a more historically typical increment of a quarter percentage point. I anticipate we will need to continue gradually raising the fed funds rate until we see convincing evidence that inflation is on track to return to our 2 percent target in a sustainable and timely way.\n\nThe evidence I’m looking for to gain confidence in the inflation outlook includes some further and sustained improvement in the inflation statistics, as well as a clear change in the underlying factors—like the imbalance of aggregate supply and demand and resulting very tight labor market—that have been producing high inflation. And I think we need to see the economy evolving more or less as forecasts predict. When inflation repeatedly comes in higher than the forecasts, as it did last year, or when the jobs report comes in with hundreds of thousands more jobs than anyone expected, as happened a couple weeks ago, it is hard to have confidence in any outlook.\n\nI will also remain attentive to financial conditions. Ultimately, conditions need to be sufficiently restrictive to restore price stability. We must remain prepared to continue rate increases for a longer period than previously anticipated, if such a path is necessary to respond to changes in the economic outlook or to offset any undesired easing in conditions. And even after we have enough evidence that we don’t need to raise rates at some future meeting, we’ll need to remain flexible and tighten further if changes in the economic outlook or financial conditions call for it.\n\nThe FOMC is committed to delivering a healthier economy, with maximum employment and stable prices. And our policy strategy must be one that will sustain those outcomes over the long run. That requires paying attention not only to the latest wiggles in inflation and employment, but also to whether the economy is rebalancing in a way that can last.\n\nThank you.\n\nNote\n\nI am grateful to Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for assistance in preparing these remarks.",

            "content": "Thank you, Dean [Lillian] Mills, for the kind introduction and the warm welcome to the University of Texas.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has been tightening monetary policy for the past year to bring inflation back to our 2 percent target. One of the questions I’m asked most often is: How much more will we do? More specifically, how high will we raise interest rates? Or, as my family used to ask on our road trips back home to Kentucky: Are we there yet?\n\nThose of you who have taken family road trips know that, sometimes, the best way to handle this question is not to answer it.\n\nThe same is true today in monetary policy. Just as I was committed to completing those long drives, the FOMC is committed to reaching our goal of restoring price stability. But considering the uncertainties we face, I don’t find it particularly helpful at this time to lock in on a peak rate or the precise path rates will follow. Rather, we need to keep our eyes on the economic and financial outlook and lay out a strategy that is both flexible and robust so we are best positioned to achieve our goals however the outlook evolves.\n\nInflation over the past two years has been much too high. The FOMC aims for 2 percent annual inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, but inflation has averaged 5.8 percent at an annual rate since January 2021.\n\nThis high rate of inflation weakens our economy. People’s incomes fall short of the cost of rent and groceries, and new research at the Dallas Fed finds that the rising cost of living is particularly stressful for lower-income households. Businesses can’t plan well when they don’t know what they’ll pay for materials or be able to charge their customers. And the longer high inflation continues, the greater the risk that prices and wages rise just because people think inflation will remain high—a spiral that would significantly increase the cost of bringing inflation down. In sum, price stability is foundational for a healthy economy and labor market over time.\n\nIn my view, the run-up in inflation has had two sources. Special circumstances, now mostly in the rearview mirror, pushed up prices in particular sectors, like energy, manufactured goods and housing. But inflation then spread to a broad set of services, and this broader inflation is what shapes the outlook today.\n\nThe pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have made energy prices remarkably volatile. In March and April 2020, as global economic activity slowed, the price of oil fell from $60 per barrel to around $20. Then, as the economy recovered while fossil fuel production remained low, the price steadily climbed through mid-2022. Last year, Russia’s war caused additional volatility around this trend. Natural gas prices have fluctuated even more, and in Texas, we’ve also seen enormous spikes in the wholesale price of electricity during some winter storms.\n\nEnergy prices are quite noticeable in our daily lives and quite important to the economy here in Texas, where oil and gas production makes up more than 11 percent of state GDP and half of state exports. But because energy inflation tends not to persist, the recent drop in energy prices doesn’t greatly change the inflation outlook.\n\nTurning to goods, responses to the pandemic disrupted global supply chains just as consumers shifted to consuming more goods and fewer services. The natural result was that prices of goods rose.\n\nStatistical measures suggest that supply-chain pressures peaked in December 2021 and have now recovered substantially, though not fully. Correspondingly, goods prices have started to fall. Continued recovery in supply chains should help hold down goods inflation going forward, although there are risks from China’s transition out of zero-COVID policies and the disruptions resulting from Europe’s energy crisis.\n\nIn the housing market, people fortunate enough to be able to work remotely during the pandemic often wanted bigger homes. They also considered locations far from their offices—in some cases, across the country. And mortgage rates fell to historically low levels in 2020 and 2021. All of this drove up demand for housing.\n\nBut homes can be built only so fast, so in the short run, prices soared. Austin was perhaps the national epicenter of this effect, fueled by domestic migration and the boom in technology jobs. House prices rose 58 percent here, outstripping all other major Texas metros and straining affordability for working-class and middle-class families.\n\nHousing prices nationally and in Austin are now cooling as mortgage rates have risen. However, our research at the Dallas Fed finds that changes in house prices take around 18 months to feed into measures of housing inflation, which are based on average rents. The main reason for the lag is that rents adjust infrequently as leases turn over. Our research suggests it could be mid-2023 or later before year-over-year housing inflation begins to fall. Still, I’m confident relief will come.\n\nWhat’s more concerning is the way inflation has spread to the broader economy. About half of personal consumption consists of what are called core services excluding housing. This category includes everything from health care to transportation to entertainment to dining out. Early in the pandemic, prices of nonhousing services were soft as many consumers stayed home. But as the economy reopened, inflation began to broaden. Core services inflation excluding housing has now been running in a range of 4–5 percent for close to two years, and while headline inflation has softened notably in the last few months, this category has stayed high.\n\nBroad-based and persistent services inflation surprised many forecasters who thought inflation would come down when shocks like supply-chain disruptions had dissipated. Moreover, it’s hard to point to special circumstances that suggest services inflation will go away on its own. Rather, I see elevated services inflation as a symptom of an overheated economy, particularly a tight labor market, which will have to be brought into better balance for the overall inflation rate to return sustainably to 2 percent.\n\nThe labor market is important in its own right for monetary policy, given the FOMC’s mandate to achieve both price stability and maximum employment. But in addition, because the tight labor market appears to be driving the broad-based services inflation we are seeing today, the outlook for inflation hinges in large part on how much and how rapidly the labor market eases.\n\nServices prices depend substantially on labor costs, and wages have been growing at about a 5 percent annual rate by a variety of measures. For that kind of wage growth to be consistent with 2 percent inflation over the long run, productivity would have to rise at a 3 percent annual rate. Yet output per hour worked grew at an annual rate of only 1 and a quarter percent from 2012 through 2019, and there is little indication it has accelerated since then. So, absent a dramatic rise in productivity, it seems likely that returning inflation to 2 percent will require wage growth to slow substantially. That may take time. Respondents to the Dallas Fed’s Texas Business Outlook Surveys expect more than 5 percent wage growth in 2023, which is down significantly from what they saw in 2022, but still quite elevated.\n\nOther statistics also point to an unsustainably tight labor market. As of November, there were 1.7 job openings for every unemployed person in the United States. This is down from a peak of two openings per unemployed person last March but still well above the ratio of 1.2 openings per unemployed person in 2019—which was thought at the time to be a very strong labor market. Payrolls have been growing by more than 200,000 workers per month. And even without looking at the statistics, you can see how tight the labor market is when your favorite restaurant or store cuts its hours because it doesn’t have enough workers.\n\nBut some other information is starting to point to a slower labor market. While job growth has remained robust in the payroll survey of employers, numbers based on a household survey are significantly lower since last spring. And a much-larger dataset called the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) shows a sharp slowing in employment growth in the second quarter of last year. In fact, when benchmarking Texas jobs data to the QCEW, which the Dallas Fed does regularly, the revisions reduced Texas job growth from 4.7 percent to 3.4 percent, annualized, for the first 10 months of 2022. Some business contacts also tell me their hiring plans are slowing. In addition, wage pressures moderated in the latest national report on average hourly earnings. I’d need to see a lot more data, though, to be convinced the labor market is no longer overheated.\n\nTo achieve better balance, labor supply will have to increase, or labor demand will have to decrease.\n\nLabor supply has been weak coming out of the pandemic. The labor force is several million people below what we would have expected by now based on prepandemic trends. You might be surprised that rapidly rising wages haven’t encouraged more people to look for work, but because wages haven’t risen as fast as inflation for most workers, the incentive to work isn’t necessarily that strong. Labor supply is also held back by a substantial number of early retirements, as well as deaths and lingering illness from the pandemic and structural challenges like the lack of child care for working parents and a decrease in immigration. Beyond that, employers tell me that when workers are available, they often lack the necessary training or skills.\n\nWhile all these constraints are at play in Texas, the state has been a bit of an outlier. The labor force here is 5 percent above its prepandemic level, thanks to accelerating migration from other states.\n\nAddressing the structural challenges is critical for the Texas and U.S. economies in the long run. Developing a larger, higher-skilled workforce will help ensure we have a strong economy for everyone. At the Dallas Fed, we’re committed to partnering with communities in our region and using our research to help advance solutions. But that work takes time. So when it comes to the current elevated inflation, the FOMC has to respond by tightening monetary policy to reduce demand.\n\nWhat do I mean by tightening monetary policy? The FOMC’s primary tool is the target range for the federal funds rate, an overnight interest rate. Since the start of 2022, we have raised this target by 4.25 percentage points, the largest one-year increase in four decades. In addition, since June 2022, we have been reducing our holdings of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities.\n\nBoth of these tools push up interest rates for consumers and companies throughout the economy. Financial conditions have, therefore, tightened significantly. The 10-year nominal Treasury yield is up nearly 2 percentage points, and mortgage rates are up nearly 3 percentage points, since the start of 2022. Importantly, since the September FOMC meeting, real medium-term interest rates as measured by the yields on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities have averaged above 1.5 percent. That is a significantly restrictive level given that most estimates suggest the neutral real interest rate is below 1 percent.\n\nIn moving forward, we need to manage two risks. And in both cases, the risk is not just that of getting a slightly different outcome than we’d prefer, because the financial system and economy sometimes shift in abrupt and nonlinear ways. The most important risk I see is that if we tighten too little, the economy will remain overheated, and we will fail to keep inflation in check. That could trigger a self-fulfilling spiral of unanchored inflation expectations that would be very costly to stop. We must stay focused on bringing inflation back to target in a timely way. At the same time, if we tighten too much or too fast, the labor market could weaken much more than is necessary to control inflation. Those job losses would be very costly, too, particularly for the most vulnerable in society.\n\nThere is much we don’t know about how 2023 will unfold. There is uncertainty, first of all, about how much and how rapidly the economy will respond to tighter monetary policy—the famous “long and variable lags.” We also could get good news, like an unexpected increase in labor supply or gains in productivity that would allow inflation to fall without as much slowing of economic activity. Wage pressures could ease more rapidly than expected if the labor market proves not to be as overheated as many statistics suggest. Or, less happily, challenges like new geopolitical headwinds or rising inflation expectations could emerge. Financial conditions could ease or tighten for reasons unrelated to U.S. economic developments and monetary policy, and to maintain appropriate conditions to achieve our policy goals, it might be necessary to respond with a different policy path.\n\nIn this environment, I believe we need a strategy that is both flexible and robust.\n\nTo put ourselves in the best position to manage the risks, I believe we shouldn’t lock in on a peak interest rate. Rather, we need to continually and carefully assess what the incoming data imply about the economic outlook and adjust course accordingly.\n\nThat assessment will not be simple. I mentioned some of the mixed messages in the labor market data, and I expect that the data and qualitative reports will become even more mixed as the economy slows.\n\nNow, if you’re on a road trip and you encounter foggy weather or a dangerous highway, it’s a good idea to slow down. Likewise if you’re a policymaker in today’s complex economic and financial environment. That’s why I supported the FOMC’s decision last month to reduce the pace of rate increases. And the same considerations suggest slowing the pace further at the upcoming meeting.\n\nTo be clear, I don’t see the argument for a slower pace as depending very much on the latest data. Nor should a slower pace signal any less commitment to achieving our inflation goal, any more than slowing the car would suggest you don’t want to get back home to Kentucky.\n\nA slower pace is just a way to ensure we make the best possible decisions.\n\nWe can and, if necessary, should adjust our overall policy strategy to keep financial conditions restrictive even as the pace slows. For example, a slower pace could reduce near-term interest rate uncertainty, which would mechanically ease financial conditions. But if that happens, we can offset the effect by gradually raising rates to a higher level than previously expected.\n\nMy own view is that we will likely need to continue gradually raising the fed funds rate until we see convincing evidence that inflation is on track to return to our 2 percent target in a sustainable and timely way.\n\nThe evidence I’m looking for to gain confidence in the inflation outlook includes some further and sustained improvement in the inflation statistics, as well as a clear change in the underlying factors—like the imbalance of aggregate supply and demand and resulting very tight labor market—that have been producing high inflation. And I think we need to see the economy evolving more or less as forecasts predict. When inflation repeatedly comes in higher than the forecasts, as it did last year, it is hard to have confidence in any outlook.\n\nI will also be attentive to how financial conditions respond to the economic data and monetary policy. Ultimately, financial conditions need to be sufficiently restrictive to restore price stability. Even after we have enough evidence to pause rate increases, we’ll need to remain flexible and raise rates further if changes in the economic outlook or financial conditions call for it.\n\nWhile the fed funds rate target is our primary tool, the runoff of asset holdings is another important component of tighter policy. We expanded our balance sheet during the pandemic to support economic growth and the flow of credit to households and businesses. Now that the economy has recovered, it is important to allow these assets to mature to help restore price stability.\n\nUnlike with the fed funds rate, we are not adjusting asset runoff in response to the economic outlook. Rather, because our assets back our liabilities, like currency and bank reserves, the path of our assets will depend on the need for those liabilities. As our assets run off, our liabilities also fall. We can continue that process as long as we are providing enough currency and reserves for the payments, banking and financial systems to function smoothly.\n\nJust like with interest rates, you could ask how long that is. Here, too, I think the right answer is more about strategy than numbers. Bank reserves are currently far more than ample. And more than $2 trillion of excess liquidity is parked in our overnight reverse repo facility. If we saw some modest money market rate pressures in this environment, I would not interpret it as a sign that liquidity is scarce. It would simply be an incentive for banks to redistribute liquidity where it’s needed.\n\nThe process of redistribution from the overnight reverse repo facility to banks won’t necessarily be perfectly smooth. Banks can’t perfectly predict deposit outflows. But over time, if a bank sees reserves fall lower than it would prefer, it can attract more funding by increasing the rates it pays on deposits or wholesale borrowing. I think it is important to allow markets to work to redistribute liquidity in this way, so that the FOMC can reduce the balance sheet to an efficient size. In addition, the Fed’s Standing Repo Facility (SRF) provides a backstop against excessive interest rate pressures or shortfalls in reserves. I would be comfortable seeing some temporary usage of the SRF while balances in the overnight reverse repo facility remain high, as part of the process of redistributing liquidity.\n\nWith the SRF as a backstop and the power of market incentives to redistribute liquidity, I am confident that we have room to continue running off our assets for quite some time. Exactly how long that is will depend on a careful assessment of the financial environment. The financial system is constantly evolving. We can’t pinpoint the amount of liquidity that will be needed over time. We’ll need to watch the outlook and adjust our balance sheet strategy appropriately so that liquidity levels don’t fall too low.\n\nIn conclusion, the FOMC is committed to delivering a healthier economy, with maximum employment and stable prices. To achieve this, I expect we will need to continue increasing the fed funds rate. In my view, we shouldn’t lock in on a peak interest rate or precise path. Instead, I believe it’s appropriate to gradually raise rates, carefully assess financial conditions and the outlook, and remain flexible to adjust as needed, so we can robustly manage the risks we face.\n\nThank you. I’d be happy to answer some questions.\n\nNote\n\nI am grateful to Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for assistance in preparing these remarks.",

This is the Dallas and Kansas City Feds’ seventh joint conference on energy, and the topic is more vital than ever. As a newcomer to this region, where energy is so central to the economy, I’m eager to learn and delighted to participate in this conference for the first time.\n\nI’d like to thank everyone who has worked so hard to bring this event together, and particularly thank Esther George, president of the Kansas City Fed, for her partnership on this effort over the years. President George has been an extraordinarily impactful leader across all aspects of the Federal Reserve’s mission during 40 years of service. She is a wise voice in our monetary policy discussions; she has brought about a leap forward in our nation’s payments system as executive sponsor of the forthcoming FedNow service; and she has been a strong advocate for effective and efficient regulation of banks, especially community banks, throughout her career. President George is retiring this January—but before that, she is going to do us the honor of giving today’s keynote address. Esther, I’m so grateful for everything I’ve learned from you, and I know I’m not alone when I say we will miss you deeply.\n\nToday’s conference theme is “Energy and the Economy: The New Energy Landscape.” I’d like to share a few thoughts on energy and on the economy to begin our discussions. As always, these views are mine and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nEnergy prices have been extremely volatile this year. The front-month futures price of West Texas Intermediate oil was up more than 52 percent at points during the year, though it has since retraced, while natural gas is up 20 percent since a year ago at the Henry Hub and 61 percent in continental Europe. Significant pressures and volatility in energy prices have stemmed from Russia’s war against Ukraine and Russia’s weaponization of energy exports. Although European nations have worked hard to build natural gas inventories and make plans to conserve energy, Europe still faces a difficult winter under even the best scenarios. This context provides daily reminders that energy plays a critical role in economic life and national security.\n\nEnergy is especially important here in the Tenth and Eleventh Federal Reserve Districts, which together produce almost half of the nation’s energy. Texas leads the nation in the production of oil, natural gas and wind power, and is second in utility-scale solar installations. Our region also leads the nation in refinery capacity and petrochemical production. In Texas, oil and gas production is a significant employer and makes up 11 percent of state GDP and almost half of exports. Adding in chemical products, the energy share of state exports rises to more than 60 percent.\n\nThe Dallas Fed is deeply committed to advancing the understanding of energy’s influence on the regional, national and global economies. We do so through our public outreach and research, including our quarterly energy survey of 200 oil and gas firms in Texas, southern New Mexico and northern Louisiana. We are grateful to those of you who participate in the survey.\n\nWe also bring people together, at events like today’s conference, our Energy Advisory Council meetings and other important gatherings, to work through the issues and identify constructive paths forward.\n\nAs Daron said, my years of experience in finance have given me a deep understanding of the criticality of energy markets and how events in these markets can reverberate through the broader financial system. But I am relatively new to the real side of the energy economy—namely, how energy is produced, distributed and consumed. So, although I’m fortunate to have an expert energy team at the Dallas Fed and have learned a great deal from visiting with some key energy leaders around the Eleventh District, I look forward to listening and learning more. I am particularly looking forward to today’s discussions and to connecting with all of you.\n\nA deep understanding of the energy ecosystem is critical so the Federal Reserve can best accomplish core elements of our mission: setting monetary policy to promote maximum employment and stable prices, promoting the stability and efficiency of the financial system, and supporting community development. Energy sector developments affect economic output, employment, inflation, investment and credit markets. In turn, the Federal Reserve’s policies significantly affect the energy sector, through both changes in macroeconomic conditions and changes in financial conditions that influence investment.\n\nToday’s economic conditions are complex, but they can be summarized in five words: Inflation is much too high.\n\nNot only is inflation far above the FOMC’s 2 percent target, but with aggregate demand continuing to outstrip supply, inflation has repeatedly come in higher than forecasters expected. This morning’s CPI [Consumer Price Index] data were a welcome relief, but there is still a long way to go.\n\nPrice stability is foundational for a healthy labor market and economy over time.\n\nIn short, high inflation is a drag on our economy. The longer it continues, the worse the drag gets, the greater the risk that high inflation becomes entrenched and the greater the cost that must be paid to bring inflation down. The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate for monetary policy—maximum employment and price stability—but to achieve the maximum employment part of the mandate in a sustainable way, I believe monetary policy must focus now on promptly restoring price stability.\n\nThe FOMC has raised its target range for the federal funds rate by 3.75 percentage points since the start of the year, including with historically large 75-basis-point hikes at each of the past four meetings. Financial markets are pricing in the expectation of substantial further increases, and the FOMC is also removing monetary accommodation by reducing our asset holdings as described in the plans that the FOMC issued in May. As a result, broad financial conditions have tightened significantly. The 10-year Treasury yield has risen to more than 4 percent, compared with 1.51 percent at the start of the year, and option-adjusted yields have reached nearly 6 percent on investment-grade corporate debt and about 9 percent on high-yield debt. Thirty-year fixed mortgage rates have climbed to 7.32 percent from 3.27 percent. Importantly, real—or inflation-adjusted—interest rates, as measured by yields on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, are significantly above zero across the yield curve.\n\nThese tighter financial conditions are beginning to bring demand back into balance with supply, particularly in interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as housing.\n\nSufficient cooling of the economy will eventually bring inflation back to our target. But this process is just getting started. The labor market remains very tight, and wages continue to grow considerably faster than the rate that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation.\n\nYou may have heard debate about whether tighter policy will imperil the financial system. It’s important to remember that higher interest rates should cause pressures. As you are likely well aware, some investments that had a positive net present value at last year’s interest rates do not make sense at today’s higher rates. Some projects will have to shut down. Financial markets, businesses and the economy will have to adjust after so many years of near-zero rates. Such adjustments are expected and appropriate to moderate demand and reduce inflation.\n\nSo far, I believe we are seeing a normal financial market response to tighter monetary policy. Although the cost of credit continues to rise and issuance continues to slow, credit markets remain open for most borrowers. And while liquidity conditions in key financial markets have been strained, those strains appear so far to result primarily from high economic uncertainty and volatility that raises the costs of market-making, rather than the other way around.\n\nAlthough inflation poses hardships in the near term and damages the economy’s long-run strength, falling house prices, a cooling labor market and tighter financial conditions create hardships of their own.\n\nI believe that the FOMC must do everything we can to restore the price stability that will support a healthy economy in the long run, but we should also try, if we can, to avoid incurring costs that are higher than necessary.\n\nIn my career in financial markets, I’ve learned that financial conditions usually evolve smoothly but sometimes deteriorate abruptly, with severe consequences for the economic well-being of households and businesses. As financial conditions become more restrictive, I am attentive to the potential for nonlinear and unexpected responses to further policy tightening.\n\nWhile I believe it may soon be appropriate to slow the pace of rate increases so we can better assess how financial and economic conditions are evolving, I also believe a slower pace should not be taken to represent easier policy. I don’t see the decision about slowing the pace as being particularly closely related to the incoming data. The restrictiveness of policy comes from the entire policy strategy—not just how fast rates rise, but the level they reach, the time spent at that level, and, importantly, the factors that determine further increases or decreases. The FOMC can and should adjust other elements of policy to deliver appropriately tight conditions even as the pace slows. We must remain firmly committed to our 2 percent inflation goal.\n\nI will look to a wide range of information to assess whether policy is sufficiently restrictive. For example, I’ll be watching the evolution of the labor market and economy, as well as thinking about real yields and about the accuracy of inflation forecasts, among other factors. Real interest rates remaining significantly above zero would contribute to the slowing of demand that I expect will reduce inflation. By contrast, inflation forecasts that consistently miss on the low side do not foster confidence that we understand the inflation process well enough to predict success.\n\nThat is a lot of words to explain a five-word economic situation. So let me sum up. Inflation is much too high. The FOMC must restore price stability—but must also proceed in a way that allows us to better assess how financial and economic conditions are evolving. That is how we can deliver the healthier economy, with stable prices and maximum employment, which is the Federal Reserve’s responsibility.\n\nThank you. I look forward to learning from all of you today, and especially to hearing President George’s keynote remarks over lunch.",

            "content": "October 4, 2022\n\nGood morning and thank you all for joining us for the second day of our conference on technology-enabled disruption.\n\nThis conference series started in 2018 as a collaboration between the Atlanta, Dallas and Richmond Federal Reserve Banks. The vision for the conference series was to bring together business leaders, academics, educators and policymakers to explore the implications of technology-enabled disruption for business, labor markets and, ultimately, monetary policy from a variety of angles. This model has proven remarkably effective, and we are delighted to be able to do the event in person again this year.\n\nThe broad theme of the conference series is to consider how technological change—driven primarily by innovations in information technology—is playing a disruptive role in economic life. Past installments, as well as yesterday’s sessions, have focused mainly on how technological change is disrupting existing business models and the broader macroeconomy. We have also made a point of hearing from educators and others involved in workforce development to better understand how education and training infrastructure needs to evolve to meet the needs of the future.\n\nOne theme we explored in the first conferences was the disconnect between the seemingly rapid pace of technological change and the disappointing pace of measured productivity growth. That puzzle has yet to be resolved. Yesterday, we learned that the surge in productivity that we saw during the pandemic did not herald a new age of faster productivity growth but rather was just a temporary deviation. Another topic of conversation at the earlier conferences was the disruptive potential of online education. I think we all learned during the pandemic that although online education has a role to play, it remains a poor substitute for in-class instruction for many students.\n\nToday, we’ll get to look at disruption in an area that’s been a significant focus for me over many years—namely financial services.\n\nAcross a range of areas, technology is allowing the financial system to move faster, to serve new customers, but also to take on some new risks. During the pandemic, there was a big shift from cash to digital payments as more transactions were conducted online.[1] Trading in crypto assets has grown substantially and brought with it a range of new use cases as well as growing operational, crime and other risks. More central banks are experimenting with digital currencies.\n\nThese developments pose important challenges for public policy. Well-designed improvements in financial technology have the potential to reduce frictions and make the financial system work better for all. For example, modernized payments systems can allow people and firms to move money faster, more securely and at lower cost both within the country and across borders. These improvements can have benefits all across the spectrum of income and wealth. Better cross-border payments are obviously useful for multinational corporations and can equally help immigrants send remittances to their families.\n\nBut it’s crucial that technological improvements are, in fact, well-designed. The computer scientist Bruce Schneier published an insightful essay last week in the New York Times about the perverse incentives around security in new technologies.[2] He pointed out that a start-up must focus on growing rapidly by providing the features its potential customers want before funding runs out or a competitor captures the market. As a result, security takes a back seat, and before long, the company may be serving millions of customers but without the security needed to protect them from hacking, fraud or worse. Moreover, once the service is under heavy use, it’s difficult to rebuild it more securely, and there may be little commercial incentive to do so if the security flaws aren’t readily visible.\n\nSchneier’s essay was about technology start-ups in general, but I’d note that these incentive problems are particularly severe in financial services and payments where network externalities increase the pressure on new entrants to quickly gain market share. And while Schneier focused on security, I’d argue that these incentive problems apply just as much to operational resilience.\n\nOf course, innovation does not take place in a vacuum. Regulations establish the playing field on which innovators compete and the standards they must uphold. So there is a crucial role for public policy in creating an environment where technological innovation in finance and payments can thrive, but thrive responsibly.\n\nPresident Biden’s executive order on digital assets earlier this year emphasized the need for responsible innovation, and I was encouraged to see the Treasury Department’s recent release of three reports studying these issues, as well as the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s release of a report yesterday. The reports address the future of money and payments; the implications of digital assets for consumers, investors and businesses; illicit financing risks; financial stability risks and regulatory gaps. Across the reports, there is a recognition that opportunities exist for digital assets to improve the U.S. financial and payments system, but that these opportunities come with significant risks and challenges that public policy must address.\n\nI’d like to talk briefly about the considerations on money and payments in particular. There are three broad strands of innovation in payments globally.\n\nFirst, both the public and private sectors are developing faster payments systems. The Fed will launch our FedNow service between May and July of next year, providing broad access to instant payments and complementing private sector innovations.\n\nSecond, as I mentioned earlier, some central banks are experimenting with CBDCs [central bank digital currency]. In the U.S., no decision has been made on whether to create a CBDC, and the Federal Reserve has indicated that issuance of a CBDC would need clear support from the executive branch and Congress. Treasury’s recent report highlights that extensive further research is needed. Key design choices affect a CBDC’s efficiency as a means of payment; its accessibility to consumers, especially those who currently struggle to access the financial system; its influence on the United States’ role in global finance; and the risks it may pose to national security, such as through illicit transactions, or to financial stability, such as through the potential for destabilizing runs. Additionally, it is important to assess what benefits a CBDC could bring over and above the benefits of faster payments through FedNow.\n\nThird, amid the overall growth of digital assets, the private sector has invented an array of stablecoins. If these assets’ value is indeed safe and stable, they have the potential to serve as a form of private money—that is, a unit of account, store of value and medium of exchange. But safety and stability are not automatic, as the high-profile collapses of some algorithmic stablecoins have demonstrated. Even asset-backed stablecoins may fluctuate significantly in value if the assets backing them are not sufficiently safe or liquid, and the potential for these fluctuations can in turn lead to destabilizing runs and fire sales. Some jurisdictions are considering ways to bring stablecoins inside the regulatory perimeter as banks or other licensed entities, potentially creating the ability to back stablecoins with central bank reserves. But as I’ve discussed elsewhere, this could drive large and variable demand for central bank liabilities or could change the incentives created by the monetary policy implementation framework, and it is important to take a holistic approach to these decisions.[3]\n\nThis morning, we will explore how the fintech industry has adapted and grown in the wake of the pandemic. The shift to remote work, social distancing and online retailing in 2020 accelerated trends in payments that were already in place before the pandemic, as I noted earlier. These changes raise important policy questions. The cash economy is accessible to all, but digital payments are less so. What progress has been made to make digital payments as inclusive as cash, and what further steps need to be taken? Does the shift to digital payments have implications for access to consumer credit, especially among those communities that have not historically had a strong relationship with the traditional financial sector? How should we think about balancing the risks and benefits from digital innovation in payments and finance?\n\nFinally, let me thank our colleagues at the Richmond and Atlanta Feds for working with us on this conference series and the Atlanta Fed for hosting us this year. I look forward to our discussions this morning. Thank you all again for joining us.\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n",

            "content": "Nonfarm payroll employment disappointed in April, increasing just 266,000, well below consensus expectations of nearly 1 million new jobs. With payroll employment remaining well below its prior peak, slow job growth would typically suggest weak demand for labor from firms and limited employment opportunities for job seekers. Current conditions in the labor market, however, may be far from typical.\n\nThere are several reasons why previously employed individuals may not currently be actively looking for work or are searching with low intensity. These reasons might include lingering health concerns; working mothers staying home to care for children, perhaps reflecting a lack of accessible child care options; generous unemployment insurance benefits; and decisions to retire or prioritize other activities.\n\nBased on these issues, it may be wise to consider a wider range of indicators, in addition to headline employment data releases, in order to assess the state of the current labor market.\n\nMany of the labor market indicators that we track at the Dallas Fed point to labor market conditions that are tighter than the headline level of employment would suggest.\n\nFor example, the red line in Chart 1 plots the ratio of job openings to the number of unemployed, excluding temporary layoffs.[1]\n\n\n\nDownloadable chart | Chart data\n\nYou can see in this chart that, as of March 2021, job openings were at a historically high level (blue line) and the ratio of job openings per unemployed is similar to mid-2017. Consistent with this analysis, a recent National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) survey indicates the percentage of small businesses that report few or no qualified applicants for job openings increased to 54 percent in April, above the 2019 average of 52 percent.\n\nChart 2 plots the Conference Board labor market differential, which takes the share of consumer survey respondents saying jobs are plentiful and subtracts the share saying jobs are hard to get.\n\n\n\nDownloadable chart\n\nThis differential has increased rapidly since March 2021, reaching 34.6 in May. This exceeds its 2019 average of 33.2, suggesting that jobs are relatively abundant for those looking for work.\n\nIn addition, the rate that employed workers quit their jobs was 2.4 percent in March, equal to its record high in 2019. The quits rate was historically tightly correlated with the unemployment rate through 2019—a high quits rate has been consistent with a tight labor market, as workers are confident enough to leave their current positions in order to pursue better opportunities.\n\nThe signals coming from wages are consistent with those coming from our alternative measures of labor market tightness. According to the employment cost index, which adjusts for composition effects, wages increased 2.7 percent over the 12 months ended March 2021. This is only slightly below the pace of wage growth in 2019 and much stronger than during the slack labor market conditions that existed during the aftermath of the Great Recession.\n\nIn the most recent April jobs report, growth in average hourly earnings accelerated sharply to 0.7 percent month over month, even though greater employment growth in lower-wage industries should have had the impact of weighing down this measure. It should be noted that last year, as the economy shed relatively low-paying jobs, compositional shifts appear to have artificially boosted average hourly earnings. This recent data is consistent with reports from employers throughout the Eleventh Federal Reserve District that the labor market has recently tightened, and that wage pressures have intensified since the first quarter of 2021.\n\nMany employers throughout our district report that they are struggling to rehire former employees as the economy reopens, as many of their former employees are reluctant to return to their old jobs. The Real-Time Population Survey asks individuals who were employed in February 2020, but not currently employed, whether they would be willing to return to their previous position for the same pay and hours. The share responding yes has declined to just over 50 percent in April (Chart 3).\n\n\n\nDownloadable chart | Chart data\n\nSince February 2020, the economy-wide employment-to-population ratio has declined by 3.2 percentage points, or by about 8.5 million workers. About 1.6 percentage points (4.1 million people) of the decline consists of unemployed workers who will likely eventually return to employment.\n\nThe remaining roughly 1.7 percentage points (4.4 million) represents a higher share of individuals not in the labor force—meaning that they are not currently actively looking for work. What is driving the higher share out of the labor force? Out of this 1.7 percentage points, 1.0 percentage points (2.6 million) report that they are currently retired, and 0.5 percentage points (1.3 million) report to be caregivers (individuals whose primary activity is taking care of a household or family).\n\nCan we expect the 2.6 million workers who have self-identified as retired to return to the workforce? Chart 4 shows that the share of the population in retirement increased from 18.5 percent in February 2020 to 19.5 percent in April 2021. Assuming 2019 retirement rates for the various age groups, we estimate that 0.4 percentage points of the rise in retirement (1.2 million) would have retired regardless of the pandemic. The additional retirements account for approximately 0.6 percentage points (1.5 million).\n\n\n\nDownloadable chart | Chart data\n\nOne might expect a number of individuals who have retired during the pandemic to return to the labor force as the effects of the pandemic continue to fade. However, in making this judgment it is worth comparing rates of retirement in the three years leading up to the pandemic.\n\nChart 4 shows how a hot labor market in 2018 and 2019 likely prompted many older workers to delay retirement, causing the share of the population in retirement to increase more slowly than the rate of aging would have implied. We see that during 2020 and 2021, the rate of retirement returned to its 2017 trend. How this trend unfolds—along with the degree to which caregiving, unemployment benefits and other special factors influence employment—will impact the ultimate size of the available workforce.\n\nOne group that is increasing its participation is teenagers. According to the latest employment report, the employment-to-population ratio for individuals age 16–19 increased to 32.8 percent in April, exceeding its prepandemic level of 32.1 percent in February 2020.\n\nThis increase in teenage employment accounted for approximately 78 percent of the increase in employment in the April 2021 jobs report. While this may signal increased opportunity for younger workers, it could also have negative implications for educational attainment and future productivity.\n\nIn particular, a wide range of school superintendents in the Eleventh District are expressing concern about dropout rates for their junior and senior classes and the long-term impact on the workforce if these young adults don’t return to achieve their high school certificate.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is committed to supporting a broad and inclusive recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting recession. However, as the Federal Open Market Committee’s 2020 statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy states, maximum employment “changes over time owing largely to nonmonetary factors.”\n\nIn this post, we wish to suggest that policymakers should be cognizant of a range of supply factors that may currently be weighing on employment. These factors may not be particularly susceptible to monetary policy.\n\nWe would expect that many of these factors will fade as the year progresses, increasing the number of job seekers and potentially reducing labor market tightness. However, it is also possible that labor supply will increase less than expected. It is our view that this possibility should be kept in mind as policymakers assess the appropriate stance of monetary policy.",

            "content": "In our most recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the Federal Reserve decided to leave the federal funds rate unchanged in a range of 1.5 to 1.75 percent. In addition, we made a 5-basis-point upward adjustment to the interest paid on excess reserves (IOER) held by banks on deposit at the Fed. This was a technical adjustment intended to support the setting of the federal funds rate well within the range set by the FOMC.\n\nI supported these decisions as well as the post-meeting communication regarding the path of the Federal Reserve balance sheet. The Fed balance sheet expanded rapidly in the fourth quarter of 2019 as repurchase agreement (repo) operations and Treasury bills purchases were needed to maintain reserve levels.\n\nIt is my hope and expectation that, as reserves in the banking system meet or exceed ample levels of at least $1.5 trillion, the Fed balance sheet will expand only gradually to reflect trend growth in the demand for currency and other Federal Reserve liabilities. I would expect that, over the first half of 2020, the pace of balance sheet expansion will moderate significantly as active repo operations gradually decline and reserve management purchases of Treasury bills slow in the second quarter.\n\nI continue to support a review of our supervisory guidance and regulatory policies in an effort to assess whether we could put Treasury bills and reserves on a more equal footing in terms of bank liquidity management. I also remain open to consideration of other alternatives which could help the Fed run an ample reserves regime with a sensitivity to limiting growth in the size of the Federal Reserve balance sheet.\n\nIt is the base-case view of Dallas Fed economists that U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) will grow at a rate of approximately 2 to 2.25 percent in 2020. This forecast is based on our expectation that global growth is likely to remain sluggish but will show signs of stabilization due to some calming of trade uncertainties—particularly as a result of the ratification of the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement, the Phase One agreement with China, and some greater clarity regarding Brexit. In this regard, we also expect U.S. manufacturing to remain sluggish but show some signs of stabilization. Lastly, we expect business fixed investment to firm somewhat from disappointing levels in 2019. These developments, combined with a strong U.S. consumer (which accounts for approximately 70 percent of U.S. GDP), should lead to solid growth in 2020.\n\nOf course, this outlook is clouded by the impact of the coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China. This development will likely mean slower growth in China and risks to the downside for global growth. Dallas Fed economists are considering various alternative scenarios for how this virus could impact U.S. and global GDP growth. However, at this stage, it is still too soon to predict with confidence the ultimate impact of this virus on the U.S. and global economies. Our Dallas Fed team will continue to actively monitor this situation and assess its ongoing implications.\n\nIn addition, I am cognizant that the delay in production of the Boeing 737 Max airplane is likely to reduce U.S. GDP growth by as much as 0.4 percent (annualized) in the first quarter of 2020. The extent of the full-year effect will ultimately be determined by the timing of a return to production, likely later in the year. Finally, the first half of 2020 will benefit from the return of post-strike production at General Motors.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the U.S. consumer continues to be the key underpinning of the U.S. economy. Household debt to GDP has gone from a peak of 98 percent in 2008 to approximately 74 percent as of third quarter 2019.[1] In addition to this improvement in household balance sheets, the current rate of unemployment in the U.S. is approximately 3.6 percent.[2] Furthermore, the U-6 measure of unemployment—which takes into account the unemployed, plus discouraged workers who have given up looking for work, plus workers who work part time but would prefer to work full time—is currently running at approximately 6.9 percent.[3] This reading is near its historic low of 6.7 percent reached in December 2019. The labor force participation rate (the percentage of 16 year olds and above either employed or actively looking for work) now stands at 63.4 percent, its highest level since June 2013.[4] All this suggests to Dallas Fed economists that the U.S. economy is likely at or past the level of full employment. This further bolsters our near-term confidence in the strength of the U.S. consumer.\n\nBased on our forecast, we would expect headline unemployment to drift down from the current reading of 3.6 percent to approximately 3.5 percent during 2020. In addition, Dallas Fed economists believe that the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation rate will gradually move toward the Fed’s 2 percent target in the medium term. This confidence is bolstered by the fact that the Dallas Fed’s Trimmed Mean PCE measure of inflation, which exes out inflation components with extreme moves to the upside or the downside, is currently running at approximately 2 percent on a 12-month basis.[5] Our research indicates that the trimmed mean is a good indicator of future headline PCE inflation trends.\n\nExpected 2020 growth of 2 to 2.25 percent is in line with the average growth rate of the U.S. economy since 2010.[6] However, this level of growth is sluggish by historical standards. GDP growth is made up of growth in the workforce plus growth in productivity. As I’ve discussed in previous essays, aging demographics and sluggish workforce growth (Chart 1) and more modest productivity growth (Chart 2) are negatively impacting potential GDP growth in the U.S.\n\n\n\nDownloadable chart\n\n\n\nDownloadable chart\n\nThe rate of U.S. workforce growth has declined from a yearly average of approximately 2.71 percent in the 1970s to 1.27 percent in the 1990s to an expected 0.24 percent in the 2020s.[7] This deceleration in workforce growth is not being offset by improvements in productivity per worker. The rate of U.S. productivity growth has declined from a yearly average of almost 2 percent in the 1990s to 0.85 percent since 2010.[8]\n\nIt’s the view of Dallas Fed economists that structural reforms are needed if we are to improve U.S. workforce growth. These reforms could include policies that facilitate child care and transportation services, which make it easier for marginally attached workers to enter and stay in the workforce. In addition, immigration reform that focuses on skills and employer needs could also help increase the rate of U.S. workforce growth.\n\nProductivity growth could be enhanced by policies that help workers impacted by technology and technology-enabled disruption to get reskilled. Dallas Fed economists believe that the emphasis on skills training programs could be dramatically increased in the U.S. In addition, policies that focus on improving early-childhood literacy and the overall math, science and reading skills of our next generation of workers would help improve their adaptability and productivity. Lastly, investments in selected infrastructure improvements could help create greater efficiencies in the U.S. economy.\n\nWe would also note that, in this context, global trade is likely an opportunity for the U.S. to grow faster. In particular, integrated logistics and supply-chain arrangements, especially those with Mexico and, to a lesser extent, Canada have been critical to improving the global competiveness of U.S. firms, which has allowed these firms to add jobs and domicile their businesses in the U.S.\n\nFinding ways to improve the potential growth rate of the U.S. economy is critical given that the amount of U.S. government debt held by the public is now approximately 79 percent of GDP[9] and the present value of unfunded entitlements is now approximately $59 trillion.[10]\n\nWhile monetary policy has a key role to play in enhancing the ability of the U.S. economy to grow at its potential, it is not a substitute for structural reforms and policies that can improve the level of potential growth in the U.S. As a central banker, I believe it is important to point out the limits of monetary policy and the need for broader policies to improve the economic future of the U.S. (See the essay “Economic Conditions and the Key Structural Drivers Impacting the Economic Outlook,” Oct. 10, 2019, which discusses these structural challenges and opportunities).\n\nOil industry outlook\n\nThe Eleventh District of the Federal Reserve is home to the Permian Basin, which accounts for approximately 36 percent of U.S. crude oil production.[11], [12] Due to the emergence of the U.S. shale industry, the U.S. now produces approximately 12.9 million barrels per day (mb/d) of crude oil.[13] This compares with crude oil production of approximately 11.3 mb/d by Russia and 9.7 mb/d by Saudi Arabia.[14]\n\nIt is the view of Dallas Fed economists that global oil production (crude oil and liquids) will increase by 0.7 mb/d to approximately 102.3 mb/d from fourth quarter 2019 to fourth quarter 2020.[15] This production forecast assumes growth of 0.7 mb/d in the U.S. and 0.7 mb/d in other non-OPEC countries, and a decline of 0.7 mb/d in OPEC oil production.\n\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that global consumption will likely grow by approximately 1.0 mb/d to 102.2 mb/d in 2020.[16] The coronavirus presents a meaningful risk to demand growth globally as overall Chinese oil consumption represented approximately 14 percent of total global consumption and approximately 57 percent of global consumption growth in 2019.[17] The IEA consumption forecast indicates that, due to the impact of the virus, first quarter 2020 global oil demand will decline by approximately 0.4 mb/d versus the first quarter of 2019. It further assumes that a substantial portion of this consumption decline will reverse in subsequent quarters of 2020. It is worth noting that the expected first-quarter consumption decline would be the first year-over-year drop in quarterly oil demand since the Great Recession of 2007–09.\n\nIn this context, Dallas Fed economists expect U.S. crude oil production growth of approximately 0.4 mb/d in 2020.[18] This compares with production growth of 2.0 mb/d in 2018 and 0.9 mb/d in 2019.[19] These forecasts assume West Texas Intermediate oil prices stay in the range of approximately $50 to $60 per barrel.\n\nThis expected decline in U.S. production growth is influenced by weaker global demand growth and is also heavily influenced by a dramatic increase in pressure from capital providers to see “discipline” in capital allocation from energy and production firms. In practice, this means that capital expenditures for drilling activity will have to be funded by internal cash flow versus debt issuance. This is a fairly significant change from historic practice. It should be noted that shale projects are more “short-cycle” investments than typical conventional projects—they can be drilled and brought onstream very quickly and, on average, for approximately $6 million to $8 million per well. However, as output of wells tends to decline rapidly in the first few years of production, producers must continuously invest in order to maintain overall production levels.\n\nAs a result of these developments, our Dallas Fed oil industry contacts have indicated to us that they expect capital spending in the U.S. oil and gas sector could be down by as much as 10 to 15 percent in 2020. This reduction in capital spending is likely to have a substantial impact on energy service companies. Several companies have already announced restructurings, charge-offs and layoffs. In light of this, we would expect that 2020 will be a year of restructurings, consolidation where possible, and general belt tightening.\n\nImplications for Texas and the U.S. Economy\n\nDespite a more challenging environment for oil and gas production, Dallas Fed economists still expect 2020 job growth in Texas to be approximately 2.1 percent.[20] While the state’s economy has grown substantially and become much more diversified over the past several decades, the energy sector still represents approximately 9 percent of Texas GDP[21] and remains a key economic driver in a number of important regions of the state.\n\nIn the U.S. more broadly, lower oil prices should benefit U.S. consumers by freeing up more of their disposable income for the consumption of non-oil goods and services. However, because the U.S. is no longer a net importer of oil and petroleum products, the benefit to U.S. GDP of lower oil prices for consumers may be increasingly offset by the negative impact on domestic energy producers in terms of capital spending and employee compensation. Changes in oil prices will increasingly redistribute income between sectors and states within the U.S., as opposed to impacting the transfer of income between the U.S. and other oil-exporting nations.\n\nAs a result of these developments, over the past several years, the U.S. has become somewhat less sensitive than in the past to oil price fluctuations. Additionally, since the 1970s, the U.S. economy has become less oil-intensive due to substitution for oil by other forms of energy, improved fuel efficiency, and growth in the less-energy-intensive services sector as a share of the overall economy.\n\nGrowth in Renewables\n\nDallas Fed energy economists expect that global energy consumption will increasingly reflect reduced reliance on fossil fuels (oil, natural gas and coal) as a share of total consumption. This reduced reliance is primarily due to expected growth in renewable energy. Renewable energy sources include hydropower, solar power, wind power (offshore and onshore), geothermal and modern bioenergy production (including energy content in solid, liquid and gaseous products derived from biomass feedstocks and biogas). While estimates of the increase in renewable energy production vary, there is clear evidence that a transition is underway in the energy industry.\n\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) base-case forecast suggests that renewables are likely to substantially increase as a percentage of global energy consumption over the next 20 years.[22] Their forecast indicates that, under stated policies, renewables will grow approximately 125 percent over the period, outpacing global oil and natural gas consumption growth of approximately 21 percent.[23] However, the IEA notes that if global regulators take a much more aggressive stance to achieve the energy-related goals of the United Nations Sustainable Development agenda,[24] it estimates that renewables could grow by over 200 percent and global oil and natural gas consumption could decline by as much as 20 percent by 2040.[25] In that case, renewables would account for nearly 33 percent of global energy consumption.[26]\n\nOur Eleventh District industry contacts report to us that they believe investments in sustainability and innovative approaches to mitigate the impacts of climate change are likely to provide substantial growth opportunities for U.S. businesses. We are already seeing a number of these investments in Texas.\n\nIt is my view that, based on my base-case outlook for the U.S. economy, the current setting of the federal funds rate at 1.5 to 1.75 percent is roughly appropriate. Consistent with this view, my Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) submission in December 2019 indicated that I expected no movement in the federal funds rate through 2020.\n\nOf course, my views are subject to revision based on how the outlook for the U.S. economy evolves over the course of this year. In that regard, I will be closely monitoring a variety of economic developments and, in particular, continuing to assess how the coronavirus ultimately will impact the U.S. and global economies.",

            "content": "November 18, 2015 Houston\n\nThank you, President Khator for that very warm introduction. Renu Khator is a fantastic president of the University of Houston and chancellor of the University of Houston System. You may know that she also chairs the board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. This is an important job, and we appreciate the contributions she makes to the Dallas Fed and the Federal Reserve System. President Khator, thank you for your service and for your leadership.\n\nIt is an honor for me to be here today. Growing up in Kansas, I frequently traveled throughout Texas with my father, who was a jewelry salesman. Through these visits, I learned firsthand the challenges of running a small jewelry store. I learned about the importance of access to credit in order to carry inventory. I learned about the key role that community banks play in helping small businesses get started and flourish.\n\nIn my professional career, I visited Houston regularly while working as a banker and, later, as a professor. Things here have changed a lot over all these years—but I have always been impressed by the entrepreneurial spirit and can-do attitude in this city and in this state. It is a pleasure for me to be in Houston.\n\nI have been president of the Dallas Fed for about 2 1/2 months now and have represented the Eleventh District in two Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings—in September and October. People often ask me if there have been any surprises. The answer is yes—and they have all been positive.\n\nFirst, I have been enormously impressed with the quality, rigor and dedication of the Federal Reserve staff who work in the Eleventh District and throughout the entire Federal Reserve System. They are truly outstanding. They are focused on the mission of serving the people of this district and the nation. If you could see what I see every day, you would be enormously impressed.\n\nSecond, I have been gratified by the warm welcome and hospitality of the people of the Eleventh District, which (as you probably know) includes Texas, southern New Mexico and northern Louisiana. They have been welcoming and have gone out of their way to help me integrate into the community and get up to speed so I can effectively do my job. Since I started this job, I have spent a substantial amount of time meeting with business and community leaders, as well as a variety of other people in the district, and talking with Federal Reserve staff to get their advice and perspectives. Through these interactions, I have learned that an openness and a willingness to embrace newcomers set Texas apart—I believe these are characteristics that have helped to make this state so successful.\n\nSo now, I’m proud to say that, while I wasn’t born in Texas, I got here as soon as I could!\n\nAs you may know, I worked in the global markets for 23 years and then taught leadership at Harvard University for 10 years. I lived in Asia during five of those years (in the early 1990s). Over the course of my career as an executive, I’ve run several global businesses, seen booms and busts in the markets, and certainly made my share of mistakes. As a professor, I’ve had a chance to work with a broad range of leaders across sectors and countries—and learned a lot about what leadership practices work and about those practices that usually do not. I bring these lessons and experiences to my new role as president of the Dallas Fed and a participant in the FOMC.\n\nWith this as background, I’d like to discuss today the economic conditions in the Eleventh District, the nation and the world. Then I’ll discuss the implications of all this for U.S. monetary policy. Of course, the views I express today are my own and are not necessarily shared by my Federal Reserve colleagues.\n\nEleventh District: Discussion of Energy\n\nLet me start with a discussion of the energy industry because of its importance to the Eleventh District and its broader impact on the national and global economies.\n\nPercentage-wise, the state’s energy sector is smaller than it was in the mid-1980s. However, it is still a major driver of the Texas economy. The industry in Texas accounts for roughly 3 percent of employment but is responsible for 14 percent of the state’s gross domestic product (GDP).[1] This industry has transformed itself over the past two decades, which is a credit to many people in this great city.\n\nThe Department of Energy currently estimates that the world production of crude oil exceeds consumption by about 1.6 million barrels per day.[2] In the 34 member countries of the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development), excess oil inventories now stand at record levels.\n\nIt is our view that it will not be until late 2016 or early 2017 before inventories stabilize and daily production and consumption reach some reasonable degree of balance. Only after that point should demand be sufficient to begin working down this high level of inventory.\n\nWhile several factors will influence this balancing process, certainly supply will need to be further reduced among higher-cost producers. Much of this reduction is already occurring in the United States—particularly among companies that produce oil from shale formations. We have already seen dramatic rig count declines as producers change their oil-price outlook to “lower for longer” and cut back on the amount of capital allocated to drilling.\n\nSeveral additional factors will likely affect the balance between global production and consumption of crude oil. These include the level of demand in China as well as consumer demand in the U.S., and additional production coming online in Iran and Libya. Of course, geopolitical developments in the Middle East could impact production levels as well.\n\nAs market participants work to get a grip on the speed of this balancing process, we expect to see significant price swings and volatility. We also expect to see more bankruptcies, mergers and restructurings in the energy industry. Unfortunately, much of this pain will be felt in the U.S. because we have a large concentration of high-cost production coming from shale. Houston is certainly feeling some of these negative repercussions.\n\nOn the bright side, lower energy prices help U.S. consumers. However, the reduction in drilling continues to negatively impact growth and employment in the Eleventh District.\n\nDiscussion of Economic Conditions in the District\n\nThe energy situation and a stronger dollar have created headwinds in the district. Despite this, the Texas economy is expanding—Texas employment growth, which has typically been faster than that of the nation, has slipped to 1.3 percent year to date through September, compared with 1.7 percent for the U.S. as a whole. We expect Texas job growth to finish this year at 1.2 percent, much lower than the 3.6 percent growth the state experienced in 2014.\n\nThe Dallas Fed’s Texas Business Outlook Surveys (TBOS) and employment data point to continued weakness in the state’s manufacturing sector but solid growth in the service sector. The service sector has kept the Texas economy out of recession this year—with particular strength in the health care and leisure-and-hospitality industries.\n\nEven with tepid job growth, the unemployment rate in Texas has held steady this year at approximately 4.2 percent—well below the national rate of 5.0 percent (it’s 4.4 percent in Houston, 3.7 percent in Dallas, 3.6 percent in San Antonio, and 3.2 percent in Austin). The statewide rate of 4.2 percent matches the 2007 prerecession cyclical low. This resilience is due to the state’s diversified economy as well as continued significant expansion of the petrochemical industry along the Gulf Coast—spurred by low prices for natural gas (the primary feedstock).\n\nWe continue to see labor shortages in Texas in construction, machinery and food manufacturing, nursing, truck driving, retail and restaurants. Texas home prices are rising at a rapid pace—up 6.1 percent year over year in September.[3] Home inventories remain tight at 2 to 4 months in most of the state’s major markets.\n\nIt’s worth emphasizing that the migration of people and firms has been a key underpinning of the Texas economy. Over the past several years, many foreign and domestic companies have moved their operations to the state—and many others are considering moving to Texas. Since 2000, the average rate of population growth has been almost a full 1 percentage point higher in Texas than in the U.S. as a whole. I would expect this trend to continue over the next several years.\n\nWhile facing challenges, the Texas economy is proving to be highly resilient, and I’m very optimistic about the state’s future.\n\nNational Economy\n\nGDP\nU.S. GDP growth slowed to approximately 2 percent in the third quarter versus 2.3 percent over the first half of this year.[4] The Commerce Department reported a slowing of inventory accumulation during the quarter. This deceleration in inventory investment was enough to subtract roughly 0.9 percentage points of growth from the U.S. economy. In the face of uncertainty about foreign demand, along with a strengthening U.S. dollar, it appears that U.S. firms decided to cut back their stock building in the quarter in order to avoid excessive inventory accumulation.\n\nHowever, in this same quarter, the Commerce Department estimates that real final demand in the U.S. increased at a 2.9 percent annual rate—slightly better than the 2.7 percent rate recorded over the first half of the year. Most of the growth can be attributed to an increase in domestic consumer demand as well as to some gains in business fixed investment, residential investment and government purchases.\n\nThe U.S. economy maintained its forward momentum in the third quarter, largely because of strength in the service-providing sector, which represents about 80 percent of the U.S. economy.\n\nAt this point, our economic team at the Dallas Fed forecasts that U.S. GDP growth will average between 2 and 2.5 percent through the end of 2016. While this is sluggish growth compared with past expansions, given demographic trends, we believe it should be sufficient to continue to drive down the unemployment rate.\n\nUnemployment\nAs I mentioned earlier, the U.S. unemployment rate has fallen to 5.0 percent—a rate that is near most estimates of full employment.\n\nIn 2015, the U.S. has added on average 206,000 nonfarm jobs per month. In addition, the pace of employment growth accelerated in October to 271,000 jobs after decelerating in August and September. This monthly rate of job growth has been strong enough to drive down the headline unemployment rate by 0.6 percentage points since the start of the year.\n\nAt the Dallas Fed, we estimate that the breakeven number of new jobs necessary to keep the unemployment rate steady likely ranges between 100,000 and 150,000 per month—depending on assumptions regarding the labor force participation rate as well as estimates of the relationship between the number of jobs in the economy and the number of people who actually hold jobs (these measures are not identical because some people work multiple jobs).\n\nAt this point, the question is: How much “slack” remains in the economy with the unemployment rate this low? My own view is that excess capacity needs to be increasingly viewed in a global context—particularly in assessing the level of unemployment that is consistent with price stability. This is a critical point that has emerged as the global economy has become increasingly interconnected. It means that overcapacity in non-U.S. economies must be considered along with domestic labor slack in assessing the implications of a given U.S. unemployment rate.\n\nIn order to assess the level of domestic labor market slack, we closely monitor various measures beyond the headline unemployment rate. In particular, we closely track the transition of workers from part time to full time as well as the number of would-be workers who are “discouraged” and have given up looking for a job.\n\nFor much of the current recovery, these broader utilization measures suggested that there was more labor slack than was implied by the headline unemployment rate. However, particularly in the past two months, an increasing number of part-time workers have converted to full-time status—which suggests that we are making more progress toward reaching our full-employment objective.\n\nInflation\nInflation continues to run below the Fed’s 2 percent target. The headline year-over-year PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation reading for September was only 0.16 percent.[5] This is a lower level of inflation than we are accustomed to. Much of this recent weakness is due to the near-term effects of lower energy and other commodity prices, with downward pressure also coming from slowing economic growth and overcapacity outside the U.S. and the impact of a stronger dollar on import prices.\n\nOur economists particularly focus on the Dallas Fed’s Trimmed Mean PCE inflation reading, which strips out the most extreme monthly upside and downside price movements. We believe that the trimmed mean is a more useful guide to assessing the medium-term trend in headline inflation than is the conventional, ex-food-and-energy core inflation reading.\n\nThis Trimmed Mean PCE inflation measure has been running at approximately 1.7 percent year over year through September, and at a somewhat faster rate on a six-month basis.[6] The stability of this Trimmed Mean PCE inflation measure, in the face of commodity price declines and falling import prices, gives us confidence that these influences will ultimately run their course. This confidence, in combination with anticipated further reductions in labor market slack, leads our Dallas Fed economists to forecast 1.8 percent inflation in 2016 and 2 percent inflation by year-end 2017.\n\nThis is an analysis (and a judgment) that we’ll be scrutinizing and revisiting over the coming weeks and months.\n\nInternational Economy\n\nAssessments of economic conditions outside the United States are critical because the world is becoming more and more interconnected. What happens in China, emerging markets and advanced economies around the world increasingly impacts the U.S economy.\n\nOur staff at the Dallas Fed estimates that second-quarter global GDP growth (excluding the U.S.) was the slowest since the second quarter of 2013. Advanced as well as emerging-market economies experienced slower yearly growth rates in the second quarter. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), in its latest World Economic Outlook, forecasts that this trend will likely continue for the remainder of this year and through the end of 2016. Russia, Brazil and Venezuela are in outright recession. Advanced countries are experiencing only modest growth—with a forecast of 1.4 percent GDP growth for 2015.[7] While economies such as China and India still exhibit relatively strong real output growth, their growth forecasts are being revised downward due to various headwinds.\n\nFactors contributing to this uneven performance include overcapacity in various economies, higher levels of debt, falling commodity prices and exchange rate developments.\n\nLet’s focus more specifically on China. While the Chinese economy grew 6.9 percent year over year in the third quarter, according to official estimates, growth is clearly slowing. This slowing has been manifested in dramatic price swings in the Chinese stock market and in government actions to address key longer-term challenges.\n\nUnderstanding China’s slowdown is important because China is still the largest individual contributor to global growth.[8] The effects of a slowdown in China will be felt in the United States as well as other countries. The IMF forecasts that 2016 Chinese GDP growth will slow to 6.3 percent.\n\nAt the Dallas Fed, we estimate that a 1 percentage-point decline in the Chinese GDP growth rate slows the U.S. GDP growth rate by about 0.2 percentage points due to direct and indirect third-country effects.\n\nIt is my own view that the primary economic challenges faced by China—manufacturing overcapacity, an aging population, higher levels of debt to GDP, and a structural transition to a more service-based economy—are all secular. That is, they are likely to play out over many years (versus months). As a result, the world will likely have to adjust to lower expected rates of Chinese growth.\n\nImplications for Monetary Policy\n\nGiven these factors and the situation I have laid out, let me turn to a discussion of U.S. monetary policy and the decisions facing the FOMC.\n\nThe Fed has a dual mandate given to it by Congress—fostering full employment and price stability. Further, the Fed has set 2 percent as its longer-run target rate for inflation.\n\nAt this stage, it appears that we are well on our way to meeting our full-employment objective, although there is still some question as to the rate of unemployment that constitutes full employment in a more global world. As I mentioned earlier, a critical question I am focusing on is: What is the unemployment rate at which we have depleted excess capacity in the labor force? This rate may be lower than we would have previously thought.\n\nInflation continues to run below our 2 percent long-run target. However, as the labor market tightens and certain transitory factors ultimately pass through the data, our economic team in Dallas still expects to see inflation gradually rising to 2 percent over the medium term.\n\nOur economic team is continuing to consider how overcapacity, demographic trends, high degrees of leverage in some sectors and other secular issues in countries outside the U.S. (particularly China) might adversely affect GDP, unemployment and inflation within the U.S.\n\nIn light of all these factors, it will likely be appropriate that U.S. monetary policy remain accommodative for some time. Moreover, a lower-than-usual federal funds rate may well be needed to achieve any given desired level of accommodation. Accordingly, it is probable that the return to “normal” interest rates will be gradual. As a business manager or as an investor, I think these are key messages I would be taking from our FOMC statements.\n\nHowever, accommodative policy does not necessarily mean a zero fed funds rate. There are various costs to maintaining a zero fed funds rate for too long—particularly in terms of potential distortions in investment and business decisions. These distortions can create imbalances in investments, inventory and hiring decisions that may later need to be (painfully) unwound when policy normalizes. My experience is that these imbalances are sometimes tough to see in real time but often relatively easier to recognize in hindsight.\n\nIn thinking about these potential imbalances, we’re sensitive to the fact that monetary policy affects the economy with a lag.\n\nThese are all issues that will have to be assessed and reassessed as the economic outlook unfolds. In my view, the FOMC—in the previous two meetings—has been prudent in waiting for more data before taking policy action.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak today. I look forward to getting to know you better in the months and years ahead. Now, I’d be happy to take your questions.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "March 9, 2015 Houston Speech in PDF\n\nThank you, Mr. Ambassador (Ed Djerejian), for hosting me this evening. I am honored to have been chosen to give my last speech as a Federal Reserve official to the Baker Institute’s Founding Director’s Lecture Series.\n\nJim Baker is, himself, an institution; I admire him greatly. Few individuals in the history of this country—I think the only others may be George Shultz and the late Elliot Richardson—have held as many cabinet posts as Jim. And few are as loyal a friend.\n\nJim and I were cabin mates on an elk hunting trip on the high plains of Utah last fall. As you may know, he is a crack shot and a skilled hunter. We spent the first few hours after arrival at our campsite practicing at the range. While I missed every single shot, Jim effortlessly placed every one of his squarely in the bull’s-eye, at every distance. And yet the next day, within an hour of our setting out in a light snow and bitter cold, on my very first shot, I dropped a big bull that had long evaded his ultimate fate. That bull’s nickname was Hugh Hefner—he was old and always had a dozen or so cows with him. Hugh Hefner the elk had an impressive, wide-spread six by six point rack; he was a true trophy. I was proud of my little accomplishment and told Jim about it immediately and repeatedly through the day.\n\nThe next two days, Jim returned without firing a single shot. He said he “just couldn’t find anything worth shooting.” But I suspect that he held himself back simply to allow me to have my bragging rights for the trip. That’s the kind of gentleman Jim Baker is. (Though I feel compelled to tell you he did not hold himself back in loudly winning the snoring contest we had in our cabin: In addition to all his accomplishments, including his kindness to neophyte hunters like me, Jim Baker should be on the list of the world’s great snorers!)\n\nIt Ain’t Brag if It’s True\n\nOn the bragging rights front, I have thoroughly enjoyed using my perch at the Fed to spread the story of Texas’ economic success. Last Friday, I shared some statistics about our state with an audience in Dallas.[1] Like this one: 1,605,576,000,000. Do you know what that represents? No, it is not the number of “likes” or followers that Houston native Beyoncé has on social media, although that number might be up there. If you place a dollar sign before it, $1,605,576,000,000 is the estimated gross state product of Texas for 2014. One trillion, six hundred and five billion, five hundred and seventy-six million dollars. That is the amount of output Houstonians and their fellow Texans produced last year—roughly equivalent to the output of Canada, our great neighbor to the north.\n\n\n\nThere has been strong momentum building up to that number. Just since I came to the Dallas Fed in 2005, my staff estimates that the real Texas economy has grown by $382 billion, or 36 percent. That increment equates to adding more than the entire output of Norway, my mother’s homeland and now one of the world’s richest nations measured on a per capita basis.\n\nTo put Texas in global perspective, my staff put together this tongue-in-cheek map of the United States that compares the output of each state of the union with an international counterpart.\n\n\n\nI am not sure my friends in Rhode Island—whose wonderful Bryant University awarded me an honorary doctorate last June—will much appreciate their output being compared to that of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Or that another cabinet member named Richardson—Bill Richardson, who went on to become governor of New Mexico—will like seeing that New Mexico produces the economic equivalent of Serbia. Or that my colleagues in New York will cotton to having the same output level as Iran. But there you are: Texas is the second-largest economic engine in the country, behind only California. But I rather like pointing out that California can be compared to Italy, for unless it corrects its course of over-taxation and regulation, it will surely end up with an economy very much like that of the Repubblica Italiana.\n\nU.S. Economic Landscape\n\nNow enough of the Texas braggadocio, even though it happens to be true. This is my final speech at the Fed and I want to address some of the more pressing issues facing my counterparts on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in the months ahead.\n\nFirst, it helps to put the size of the U.S. economy in perspective. In 2014, the U.S. produced $17.4 trillion in goods and services. Just since I arrived at the Dallas Fed 10 years ago, the U.S. has increased its total level of real output approximately $2.2 trillion. In sum, the U.S. is a huge, muscular economy.\n\nWhat is the muscle tone of our economy? Where are we presently in terms of growth and from the perspective of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate of maintaining price stability and providing the monetary conditions to underwrite full employment?\n\nHere is a simple “dashboard” we use at the Dallas Fed to encapsulate the economy’s current condition:\n\n\n\nThe bottom line: At present, inflation is contained, unemployment is declining and approaching the level most economists feel is sustainable without creating inflationary pressures, and the overall economy is steaming along at a growth rate of 2.4 percent.\n\nImportantly, our fellow citizens are once again feeling more confident about the economy. In an economy propelled by household and business spending, it is helpful to get a grasp of the feelings of the average American consumer. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Survey does just that, and right now it is telling us that consumers feel better than they did on average from 2002 to 2007. It had been a long time since hope sprang eternal, but 2014 was a huge year for rebuilding consumer confidence.\n\n\n\nEnter Prince: ‘Gonna Party Like It’s 1999’?\n\nDespite increased consumer sentiment, the U.S. experienced very uneven gross domestic product (GDP) growth during 2014. This was partly a result of severe winter weather and partly a result of the Affordable Care Act rollout, which disrupted the pattern of household health care expenditures. For the year as a whole, growth looks to have averaged out to around 2½ percent. That may not sound like much at first blush, but it was enough to give us a 1.1 percentage-point drop in the unemployment rate and the largest job gains since 1999.[2] You might not have expected that at the beginning of the year if you had listened to the gloom-and-doomers. The musician Prince (or should I call him by one of his other names: “the artist formerly known as Prince,” Joey Coco, Alexander Nevermind or that symbol?) must have foreseen this when he sang “gonna party like it’s 1999.”\n\nSo, are we going to rock on? Should we look for more of the same in 2015? Or should we be reminded of another lyric from Prince: “… parties weren’t meant to last”? Again, we need to put things in perspective.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal recently published an article that included a chart comparing the level of real GDP in the current expansion with that of four prior expansions. In that chart, the current expansion finished dead last, with output well behind what one might have expected based on the economy’s performance during the late 1970s and the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s.\n\n\n\nThis picture changes markedly, though, if you divide GDP by the available labor force. Then the current expansion is tied with that of the 1990s and edges out those of the 1970s and 2000s. Really, all four of those expansions lie almost on top of one another, as the following chart shows. Only the recovery from the 1981–82 recession stands out. The implication is that the weak GDP growth we’ve seen during the current expansion is entirely explained by weak labor force growth.\n\n\n\nSo why has labor force growth been weak? Demographics have played a big role. Population growth has slowed from 2¼ percent per year in the mid-1970s to 1 percent per year today, and more and more baby boomers—old codgers like me and Ambassador Djerejian—are pushing retirement age. The combined effect of these trends is that growth in the working-age (16 to 64) population has slowed to just 0.5 percent per year.[3] In addition, a higher proportion of young people are attending college than in the past, and the huge flow of women from the home to the workplace has largely run its course.[4] The recession of 2008–09 undoubtedly pushed many people into premature retirement. It’s doubtful, though, whether enough of them can be brought back into the job market at this point to move the participation rate appreciably higher.\n\nIn sum, labor force growth has been anemic because of slow growth in the working-age population and because, for reasons that have nothing to do with monetary policy, the labor force participation rate for those of working age has stopped rising and started trending downward. Labor force growth is likely to remain anemic over at least the next couple of years. With the working-age population growing at only 0.5 percent per year, the dividing line between a rising and a falling unemployment rate is less than 100,000 jobs per month for any realistic assumption about labor force participation.\n\nThe point is that economic growth at the pace we saw in 2014 will very quickly drive us to and past the 5 to 5.5 percent unemployment range regarded as sustainable by most policymakers and private analysts. A repeat of 2014’s performance would put us around 4.5 percent unemployment by year-end.\n\nThe sustainable—or in Fedspeak, the “natural” rate of unemployment—varies over time with changes in educational attainment and the demographic composition of the labor force. At any point in time, estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty. We have to be constantly alert to the possibility that current estimates are mistaken. Still, given the dangers associated with overshooting full employment, I believe it behooves monetary policymakers to be cautious. With all the benefits of hindsight, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the natural rate of unemployment has averaged 5.6 percent and has never fallen below 5 percent in the United States going all the way back to 1948.\n\nSome commentators point to subdued wage growth as evidence that substantial labor market slack remains. Taking policy cues from present wage growth, though, would move us into dangerous territory indeed. Slack responds to monetary policy with a lag, and wage growth responds with a lag to slack, so current wage growth is a very backward-looking measure of policy’s stance. Moreover, research conducted at the Dallas Fed has demonstrated that wage growth’s response to labor market slack is highly nonlinear: The response gets stronger and stronger as slack diminishes.[5] The gradual increase in wage growth that we’ve seen to date is entirely consistent with historical experience once lags and nonlinearity are taken into account. The red lines in these two graphs will show you how we tracked from the beginning of 2011 to the end of 2014 in terms of wage growth detrended by inflation expectations (the vertical axis) relative to the declining unemployment rate (the horizontal axis), and then where we at the Dallas Fed expect to be at the end of 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\nLiftoff!\n\nSome highly respected observers would have the Fed wait until we “see the whites of full-employment’s eyes” before it starts raising interest rates or shrinking its $2.5 trillion bond portfolio. Would pushing past full employment really be so bad? So what if inflation rises, temporarily, above target? Can’t we do an after-the-fact course correction if it should turn out that policy has been too accommodative?\n\nThere’s certainly something to the argument that it’s okay to go off your diet from time to time, especially if your weight has been running below target. But you can’t consistently binge without getting into trouble. Sooner or later, you have to bring your caloric intake back to normal, lest your weight and your waistline balloon and your health deteriorate. In the monetary policy sphere, unfortunately, cutting back has proven to be even more difficult than it is in personal weight control. In the real world, one never sees the smooth, moderately sized unemployment increases that our simple mathematical models so readily generate. A recessionary dynamic kicks in whenever the unemployment rate rises by more than a few tenths of a percentage point. The problem with overshooting full employment to any significant degree is that it has always set the stage for a new recession. Gaining weight (reducing the unemployment rate) is easy. Attempts to lose weight (to stem overheating of the economy) seem always to get out of control and land us in the hospital. Every time the Fed has tightened policy after achieving full employment, it has driven the economy into recession.\n\nIt’s because of this dynamic, and my desire to prolong the current expansion, that I have argued that we should begin reducing policy accommodation earlier than many of my colleagues on the FOMC appear to prefer.\n\nThere’s every indication that solid, above-potential growth in employment and output is going to continue through the summer of 2015. The unemployment rate is likely to reach the bottom of the range of natural-rate estimates within that time frame. So if we are serious about limiting full-employment overshoot, I posit that prompt action to scale back policy accommodation is likely to prove imperative. The idea that we can substitute a steeper future funds-rate path for an early liftoff seems risky to me. I would rather the FOMC raise rates early and gradually than late and steeply.\n\nThe credibility of a “later and steep” policy strategy is suspect, it seems to me. Isn’t it possible—even likely—that the public will interpret a decision to defer liftoff as a signal that the committee is generally “dovish” and generally disinclined to raise rates? In other words, mightn’t the public see the choice as between “earlier and gradual” and “later and gradual” rather than between “earlier and gradual” and “later and steep”?\n\nI have felt that were we to begin liftoff—I have been eager to use this term in this town for some time, especially with Ellen Ochoa, the director of Johnson Space Center and the chair of the Houston Branch board of directors sitting right here in front of me!—earlier in 2015, markets would have more confidence about the “gradual” in “earlier and gradual.” Otherwise, as some of my colleagues have stated publicly, if we were to defer liftoff until, say, December 2015 but plan to raise rates quickly thereafter, people have to wait until January 2016 to determine whether the FOMC is serious. Early and gradual is quickly verified. Later and steep requires a high level of trust. It is certainly no stretch to think that the public might not completely buy into the “steep” in “later and steep.”\n\nAnd what about the incentive to renege? January 2016 arrives. Suppose that the public has, in fact, not bought into the FOMC’s promises of a steeper funds rate path. What if the Fed’s surveys of market operators and dealers reveal that financial bets and commitments have been made such that a move to raise rates appears likely to incite financial market turbulence? Might future policymakers then be strongly tempted to back down?\n\nInflation Outlook\n\nIn the aviary of central bankers, I am known as a “hawk,” even though I have not spoken of the threat of immediate inflation since 2008, when we had an inflationary scare before having the legs pulled out from the table of the economy with the implosion of Lehman Brothers and the financial superstructure. You may wonder how I view the minimal inflation, or even deflationary pressure, some commentators seem to be worrying about.\n\nThe FOMC is trying its level best to understand the dynamics of inflation. We have declared a 2 percent intermediate target for inflation, which seems to be standard for most central banks. Headline inflation measures show a significant shortfall from that target. The headline personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index fell 0.5 percent in January. Its 12-month increase was just 0.2 percent, down from 1.6 percent in June. Should this low, and still falling, rate of price inflation retard the date of the liftoff from the zero-interest-rate policy we have been operating for more than six years?\n\nI think not. Especially here in Houston, folks know that headline inflation is being held down by the big decline in energy prices that began in the second half of 2014. But we should also know that once energy prices stabilize, headline inflation is likely to bounce right back up. Policy needs to take past inflation into account, but it needs to take future inflation into account, too. For policy purposes, it is inflation’s medium-term trend that matters. That’s why, in evaluating progress toward our price-stability objective, I pay close to zero attention to realized headline inflation. I pay nearly as little attention to conventional core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices. I prefer the Dallas Fed’s Trimmed Mean PCE core inflation measure, which each month excludes the most extreme upward and downward price movements, regardless of their source. Here’s a graph of the current trend of both headline and Trimmed Mean PCE inflation:\n\n\n\nA good core inflation measure strips the noise out of headline inflation and leaves the signal. The trimmed mean inflation rate has, so far, held pretty steady in the face of the drop in energy prices and the appreciation of the dollar. It would not surprise me to see some decline in the trimmed mean run rate, as we did last month, in the near term; but I think that the decline will likely be temporary. The inflation trend should reverse later this year, assuming that energy prices don’t fall further and that the dollar stabilizes.\n\nIf you go to the Dallas Fed website, you will see our most recent posting: The 12-month trimmed mean rate slipped slightly to 1.5 percent, just below the range of 1.6 to 1.7 percent it’s occupied every month since April 2014.[6] While 1.5 percent is lower than the FOMC is shooting for, it’s a whole lot less discouraging than a headline inflation reading of almost nil. At the end of the year, trimmed mean inflation is more likely to be above its current 1.5 percent rate than below.\n\nJanet Yellen Is No Mae West!\n\nThat’s probably about all the interpreted Fedspeak you can handle in an evening, so perhaps I can leave you with a few simple takeaways. The U.S. economy is improving. We are approaching any sensible measure of full employment. And even though the numeric inflation target for the intermediate term has not been reached, we have reasonable price dynamics that are unlikely to threaten further economic growth and continued job creation as long as the FOMC doesn’t flinch from beginning to normalize policy on a timely basis.\n\nWe will see. In a recent speech to the Economic Club of New York, I quoted Mae West: “I generally avoid temptation,” she said, “unless I can’t resist it.”\n\nI think I am safe in saying that Janet Yellen is no Mae West. I leave the Fed with the high expectation that she will ably lead the FOMC down the path of normalizing monetary policy and resist any temptation to delay for too long that path-changing task.\n\nEd, thank you for letting me speak here tonight. I thank the people of Houston and all of Texas for allowing me the privilege of serving for a decade as president and CEO of the Eleventh District’s Federal Reserve Bank. The past 10 years have been challenging but immensely rewarding. Indeed, in my farewell letter to my staff, I suggested that given the crisis we went through, the life of a Fed president should be measured in dog years. So I thank you all for letting me lead your Federal Reserve Bank for the past 70 years.\n\nGoodnight, God bless you, and God bless Texas.\n\nNotes\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "March 6, 2015 Dallas Speech in PDF\n\nThank you Ralph (Hawkins). I am honored to be speaking to the Dallas Regional Chamber of Commerce as I finish my 10-year tenure as president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nComing to Dallas\n\nI first came to Dallas in 1973 and I remember one thing above all: A palpable sense that this was a “can-do” town in a “must-do” state.\n\nBefore settling here, I worked on Wall Street and lived in Washington, D.C., serving in the U.S. Treasury. I learned from each of those experiences and enjoyed them. But having experienced the dynamism of Dallas, I couldn’t wait to return here and make this my home. I specifically recall taking my firstborn son, Anders, on a ferry to see the Statue of Liberty in 1979. We returned to Manhattan as the sun was setting. The Big Apple glimmered in the gold light of the setting sun. But holding my little boy in my arms, I thought to myself: This is a glorious city, but New York is fast losing its right to name itself the Empire State. New York is the past; Texas’ Lone Star illuminates the real empire state. It was at that very moment that I decided Dallas is where I ought to plant my roots and raise my son and those children who will follow him.\n\nI was right. And I thank Ray Hunt and others who are here today, and Jim Collins, Stanley Marcus, Charlie Pistor, Johnny Johnson, Irvin Levy, Bob Strauss and others who have since departed this earth but are still vivid in my memory and hold a special place in my heart, for encouraging me out of the wilderness, bringing me to economic nirvana.\n\nThe Sweet Ambrosia of Texas Brag: In Context\n\nNow, whenever foreigners—columnists from the New York Times, for example—think I am simply intoxicated with the ambrosia of Texas Brag, I like to walk them through the facts, not the lore.\n\nHere is a fact—a number—that focuses the mind.\n\n\n\n$1,605,576,000,000: That is the estimated gross state product of Texas, the amount of output we produced in 2014. It is roughly equivalent to the output of Canada, our great neighbor to the north.\n\nAnd with each passing day, Texas gains momentum.\n\nWe estimate that the real Texas economy grew by $382 billion, or 36 percent, between 2005 and 2014. That increment equates to adding more than the entire output of the country of Norway, my maternal homeland and now one of the world’s richest nations measured on a per capita basis. Or to bring it closer to home, that’s almost the equivalent of gaining the sum total of the economic capacity of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Arkansas.\n\nThese sorts of comparisons provide for great cocktail conversation. So might this: a tongue-in-cheek map of the United States that has been assembled by my staff that compares the output of each state of the union with an international counterpart.\n\n\n\nRhode Island—whose wonderful Bryant University awarded me an honorary doctorate last June—produces the economic equivalent of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. And New Mexico produces the economic equivalent of Serbia, Oklahoma equates to Belarus, and Arkansas produces the equivalent of Kenya. It is noteworthy to me that the old Empire State, New York, today produces the economic equivalent of Iran. To be sure, California still out-produces us by a significant margin. But I rather like pointing out that it can be compared to Italy, for unless it corrects its course of over-taxation and regulation, it will surely end up with an economy very much like that of the Repubblica Italiana.\n\nJobs Are Paramount\n\nWe in Dallas understand that the route to dignity is a job. Working women and men are proud women and men. Nobody wants to be dependent on handouts from the state; they want to pull themselves up by the bootstraps of hard work.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is charged with a “dual mandate”: Preserving price stability and creating the monetary conditions to enable full employment. Here is the record of Texas in creating jobs, going back to 1990:\n\n\n\nTexas has outperformed the rest of the U.S. in the pace of job creation by a greater than 2-to-1 margin for more than two decades. For every 100 jobs that existed here 25 years ago, we have 68 net new jobs today. The former center of the industrial revolution driven by Henry Ford and the auto magnates, Michigan, has created only seven net new jobs; New York has created 10; the Land of Lincoln, Illinois, has created 12. Even California, the epicenter of cyberspace, has created only 25 jobs for every 100 that existed in 1990.\n\nAnd here is a slide my staff has given me as a parting gift: The growth in jobs since I assumed the helm at the Dallas Fed almost a decade ago.\n\n\n\nOf course, I’d like to take credit for this spectacular outperformance by Texas in enabling the people of Texas to realize their economic potential. But I can’t. I can only say that I have been lucky to have helmed the Dallas Fed during a time when Texas and its great cities like Dallas have blossomed and clearly outpaced the rest of America. Since April 2005, Texas has created more than 2.2 million of the 7.1 million jobs gained by the country as a whole. That means Texas accounted for almost a third of net job gains seen in the U.S. over the past 10 years, while only constituting 8.5 percent of the country’s population.\n\n“Bull Droppings”\n\nMy “foreign” friends will say “but you only create low-paying jobs in Texas” or “they are all in the oil and gas sector.” The Wall Street Journal, cleaning up my two-word response to this assertion last month, quoted me as saying this myth was “bull droppings.”[1]\n\nHere are the facts: Between 2000 and 2014, the United States economy ex-Texas (that is, were we allowed to secede statistically—and only statistically, mind you—from the union) has experienced job destruction in the two middle-income quartiles of workers, the muscle and fiber of our country. As you can see from this chart, Texas has indeed outperformed the rest of the U.S. in creating low-income jobs. But we have also outperformed in creating jobs in every income quartile.\n\n\n\nAnd Texas has seen job creation across a widely diverse swath of industrial groups, as is evident from this slide of jobs created by sector last year:\n\n\n\n2014: A Year of Records for Texas\n\n2014 was a year of records: State output climbed to new heights; employment growth was broad-based across industries and income groups; the state reached new highs for income per person; Texas was again the top migration destination from other U.S. states; we had the highest percentage of home mortgages with positive equity; construction contract values reached a new record; and oil and gas production soared along with refining capacity and exports of petroleum products.[2]\n\nTexas grew 3.4 percent from December 2013 to December 2014, and yet, if one has been reading major U.S. newspapers recently, it has been nearly all doom and gloom for Texas. To which I suppose I should once again say: “Bull… droppings!” To be sure, hydrocarbon prices have moved sharply lower the past seven months; but Texas is a diversified economy. The state has benefited from high oil prices, being the sixth-largest oil producer and the top oil services provider in the world. So, of course, lower oil prices are a headwind to economic growth here. But my researchers at the Dallas Fed don’t see recession in the cards, simply a downgrade to growth to something more like 2 percent, which would be a slower pace of growth than the nation for the first time since 2003.\n\nDallas Fed Facts\n\nThe dynamism of our state is also reflected in the activity I have personally witnessed during my tenure at the Dallas Fed. The Dallas Fed operates out of its headquarters in Dallas and through its branches in Houston, San Antonio and El Paso. In April 2005 our total Bank assets were $35 billion. At the end of 2014, our assets were $160 billion. Some 600 more banks and bank branches are ordering and/or receiving currency from the Dallas Fed since 2005. The Bank’s on-site holdings of cash increased nearly 170 percent from 2005 to 2014, from $137 billion to over $368 billion.\n\nAnd our loan portfolio has expanded significantly: The Dallas Fed made 1,764 loans through our discount window for a total of $68,522,804,000 during my watch as president and CEO. I approved each and every one of these loans personally. I’m happy to report that we didn’t lose a penny on a single one of them.\n\nLast but not unimportantly, in 2005 we distributed from our operating profits at the Dallas Fed $1.1 billion to the U.S. Treasury; last year, we distributed $3.4 billion. Over the course of my decade in this job, the Dallas Fed has distributed a total of $23 billion to the U.S. Treasury. You are looking at one of 12 people—the 12 presidents of the nation’s Federal Reserve banks—who actually pay down the nation’s deficit!\n\nThe Good People of the Fed\n\nThose who have taken the time to read some of the 155 published speeches I have given over the past decade know that I like to illustrate a point and put things in context by drawing on literature. So I am going to use a literary reference to put in context the blessing and privilege of serving alongside the people I have worked with at the Dallas Fed and in our branches, the good women and men who guided me through 96 regular and special meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee under three Fed chairmen, the many conference calls Ben Bernanke held during the financial crisis, a decade of Conference of Presidents meetings where we organize the operations of the Federal Reserve System, and the day-in, day-out handling of our business operations in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and El Paso.\n\nOne of my all-time favorite books was a gift from Anders, the son I carried in my arms on that fateful day after visiting the Statue of Liberty. It is titled The Match. It details in beautifully written, poignant prose a legendary round played at Cyprus Point in 1956 between two of golf’s greatest professionals, Byron Nelson and Ben Hogan, and the two great amateurs of the time, Ken Venturi and Harvie Ward. But it is more than a golf book. It spoke to me in a way few outside the hallowed halls of the Fed might understand.\n\nIn the afterword of The Match, the author, Mark Frost, laments the transformation of golf into a big-money sport from its origins and long tradition of honorable competition played by decent men simply for the honor of serving the game. “Not enough of the meaningful prizes in life are contested solely for honor anymore, for the love of the thing itself, or the undiluted satisfaction of testing your mettle against the best you can find and, win or lose, walking away the better for it because of the truths it enabled you to face and find out about yourself.”\n\nI didn’t take the job at the Dallas Fed for money; I gave up a lot of money to take that job. But I gave up what I was doing for something far better.\n\nFor 10 years now, I have been privileged to work alongside the most decent men and women at the Fed who are there solely for the honorable tradition of central banking, for the love of the thing itself. I have tested whatever mettle I have been able to muster against the most thoughtful and brilliant, earnest, devoted and articulate people I have ever known. And I had the privilege of doing so in the most civil and dignified forum in the government of the greatest country on earth, during one of the most challenging periods in its 239-year history. I have won some arguments; I have lost plenty. I say goodbye to them now, better for the truths they enabled me to learn not only about economics and monetary policy and operating a Federal Reserve Bank but about myself. They have provided me with the most meaningful experience of my professional life.\n\nTexas Jockeys Secretariat\n\nOn May 10, 2005, I gave my first speech in Dallas as president and CEO of the Dallas Fed to the World Affairs Council. Today, I give my last speech to you.\n\nI conclude by saying I am a proud Dallasite and a proud Texan. But I am above all a proud American. This great country took my parents in and enabled their child—me—to live the American dream.\n\nHaving lived that dream, I harbor no doubts about my country’s future. During the recent financial crisis, I admit to having some doubts; I was given to saying that relative to all other economies, America’s was “the best-looking horse in the glue factory.” Now I phrase it differently. Just look at the job creation numbers announced this morning: The nation’s payrolls increased by 295,000 in February, and the unemployment rate has dropped to 5.5 percent, approaching what many consider the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment that most economists think we are capable of achieving.\n\nIf you parse the figures, you will understand what makes me grin from ear to ear: 288,000 of those jobs were created by the private sector; only 7,000 by government. Compare that to Europe or Japan or China or whomever else the naysayers have claimed will lap us. Nowhere on the planet are there businessmen and women who are the equal to ours in entrepreneurship and innovation and determination to master the process of creative destruction and make it work for the betterment of all people. And nowhere in America is that done better than right here in Dallas and in Texas.\n\nHere is the image I now have in mind for the American economy.\n\n\n\nWe are the economic equivalent of Secretariat winning the Belmont Stakes in 1973 by 31 lengths. We are the best-looking, the strongest, and the fastest horse on the global track. And sitting atop that magnificent thoroughbred, goading and guiding it to greatness, is the best jockey one can imagine: Texas.\n\nThank you. Thank you for allowing me the honor and privilege of serving you this past decade.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "February 17, 2015 Mexico City, Mexico\n\nMy relationship with Mexico has been a lifetime affair.\n\nIt starts with a little boy who walked every morning in his gray flannel shorts and white shirt, a green leather satchel strapped to his back, from his home on Calle Monte Tauro to the Maud Crocker School.\n\nAlong the way, tortilleras would treat him to heavily buttered and salted handmade tortillas that, by the time he arrived at school, would leave stains on his shirt, incurring the wrath of his maestras.\n\nThose maestras taught him math so well, it formed the basis for his career as an investor and banker. And despite the punishment they meted out for the butter-stained shirts, to this day whenever he goes to a Mexican restaurant in Texas, he always asks first for a tortilla that he covers in butter and salt. His granddaughters call them “Baba’s tacos.” Over a half-century later, they carry on a treasured tradition that started here on the streets of D.F.\n\nIt starts with a boy being taught the history of the Olmecs, Mayans, Toltecs and Aztecs; of the Grito de Dolores of Don Miguel Hidalgo—the real “Zorro”; and of La Reforma of Don Benito Juárez.\n\nIt starts with a boy who spent Saturdays at las charreadas, cruised the then-clean waters of Xochimilco, water skied on Lake Tequesquitengo, and whose mother took him on Sundays to La Villa to the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe. It starts with a boy laughing at Cantinflas and weeping for Marcelino Pan y Vino.\n\nIt starts with a boy playing Little League baseball for los Tigres and later, los Leones, coached by a man named Norman Borlaug. On weekends, Mr. Borlaug would take that wide-eyed boy on tractor rides through corn and wheat fields, where at the end of the day they would eat paletas while the coach analyzed samples from the fields. Those samples became the basis for the Green Revolution that he started in Mexico and that ended up feeding billions of people around the world.\n\nWell, I think by now you know that the boy I’m speaking of is me. I may be the only central banker on the planet whose Little League baseball coach went on to win the Nobel Peace Prize!\n\nMy fondest childhood memories are from Mexico. Small wonder that I delighted when President Clinton asked me to become deputy U.S. trade representative and help implement NAFTA—even if it meant matching wits with formidable negotiators like Luis de la Calle and Herminio Blanco!\n\nSmall wonder that as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, I have delighted in working closely with Guillermo Ortiz and Agustín Carstens. Small wonder that at meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee or in U.S. banking circles, I have often argued Mexico’s case. Or taken sheer pleasure in pointing out to U.S. congressmen and senators, and in speeches and media interviews, that the Mexican government—unlike my own government—actually can agree on a budget, keep deficits under control, bring about structural change and resist interfering with the workings of an independent central bank.\n\nI am full of pride for Mexico. I am full of pride that this country, the country of my happiest childhood years, would now choose to honor me with the Order of the Aztec Eagle.\n\nThe citation for this honor speaks of my being a fierce defender of price stability. In the parlance of central banking, I am referred to as a “hawk.” Well, it may not surprise you to learn that taxonomists place the eagle and the hawk in the same bird family. So, Secretary Meade, Secretary Videgaray and dear friend Agustín, I accept this thoughtful honor from the president of the country I love so much with hawkish pride and close kinship to the golden eagle that is the symbol of Mexico.\n\n¡Viva México!\n\nThank you.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "February 11, 2015 New York City ·\n\nI am grateful to be invited to speak to the Economic Club of New York on the eve of my retirement from 10 years of service as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. I have sat through 78 regular meetings and an additional 18 special meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) for a total of 96 meetings under three Fed Chairs over the past decade. Given what we went through during the crisis and the healing we have tried to engineer in its aftermath, I would argue you ought to measure the life of a Fed policymaker in dog years. This morning, I thought I might offer some suggestions based upon those 70 years of experience.\n\nRoosa Boys\n\nBefore doing so, let me say I am tremendously honored to be introduced by Paul Volcker. Paul and I share a common heritage: We were both mentored by the late, great Robert V. Roosa. We are two of the “Roosa Boys,” the men—and women—Bob Roosa took under his wing every few years to teach real-world economics and a love for policy. Paul was “Class of ’47” in the Roosa “school”; I was ’75. Of course, none of the successive Roosa Boys (and Girls) could ever match the original standard, as is sometimes said about our nation’s presidency. I consider Paul to be the George Washington of monetary policy—the very exemplar of the leadership and integrity and dedication that needs to be the inviolable hallmark of every central banker who follows in his footsteps.\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, prudent monetary policy gave way to political expedience before the quick-and-easy approach was reined in by Paul. Were it not for his insistence that the Fed do what was politically unpopular, we would have seen our nation and the world destroyed by hyperinflation. Please join me in applauding Paul for his selfless service to our great country.\n\nHogwarts, the Death Star and Ebenezer Scrooge\n\nPaul Volcker stood his ground on the principle that monetary policy should never be politicized. Which brings me to the first message I wish to impart today: that of the overriding importance of maintaining an independent Fed.\n\nI recently came across a little volume by John Lanchester, titled How to Speak Money. In describing the Bank of England, Lanchester writes: “There’s a lot of ritual and ceremony and protocol at the Bank, which to outsiders seems a cross between Hogwarts, the Death Star, and the office of Ebenezer Scrooge.”[1] The same can be said of the Federal Reserve, at least by those who don’t take the time to read the copious amounts of reports and speeches and explanations the 12 Federal Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors continuously emit. It is always politically convenient to make something sound mysterious, if not malevolent, by claiming it is opaque.\n\nWhich is precisely what is happening now with Senate Bill 264: the Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2015 and its call to “audit the Fed.” The operations and finances of the Board of Governors and the 12 Federal Reserve banks are already audited up the wazoo. As to policy, as soon as our deliberations at the FOMC conclude, we report to the public what we decided. We publish a thorough review of what we discussed—and all views are considered, even those of dissenters like Richard Fisher—in the form of minutes of every FOMC meeting three weeks after we meet. And we subject our Chair to a no-holds-barred press conference on a quarterly basis. All of this alongside frequent speeches and press interviews by the 12 Federal Reserve Bank presidents, who voice their independent views.\n\nMy suspicion is that many of those in Congress calling for “auditing” the Fed are really sheep in wolves’ clothing. Having proven themselves unable to cobble together with colleagues a working fiscal policy or to construct a regulatory regime that incentivizes rather than discourages investment and job creation—in other words, failed at their own job—they simply find it convenient to create a bogeyman out of an entity that does its job efficiently.\n\nI come from Texas. I hail from the land of Wright Patman and Henry B. Gonzalez. I am fully aware of the appeal of Fed antipathy and the passion it can stir. It is nothing new. Close your eyes when you hear a strident speech about auditing the Fed from one of the current bill’s authors and you will hear echoes of radio broadcasts from the 1930s of Father Charles Coughlin, pastor of the Shrine of the Little Flower in Royal Oak, Mich. He railed passionately against the “money changers” and what he termed “the Federal Reserve banksters … and the rest of that undeserving group who without either the blood of patriotism or of Christianity flowing in their veins have shackled the lives of men and of nations ...”[2] That’s powerful rhetoric.\n\nI am personally confident that responsible senior senators and congressmen like Sen. (Richard C.) Shelby of Alabama, who chairs the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, and Congressman (Jeb) Hensarling, the Texan who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, can prevent any meddling with monetary policy while understanding the need for their colleagues to vent and score political points. And I find it hard to believe that wise and experienced leaders like Sen. Mitch McConnell would actually want the Fed’s policy deliberations to be infected by politics. There is so much else to do under the purview of the Senate and the Congress to clean up the flotsam of fiscal policy and jetsam of regulatory interference that is inhibiting job creation and economic expansion.\n\nBut we’ll see. Mae West put it best: “I generally avoid temptation unless I can’t resist it.” Even the greatest political leaders have trouble resisting the temptation to fiddle with a central bank. If you read Liaquat Ahamed’s brilliant book, Lords of Finance, you’ll recall that German Chancellor Bismarck’s closest confidant, Gershon Bleichröder, warned him “… that there would be occasions when political considerations would have to override purely economic judgments and at such times too [politically] independent a central bank would be a nuisance.”[3] We know that when the German central bank gave into political considerations, the result was the Weimar hyperinflation and its eventual consequences. And that the Bank deutscher Länder, having established the principle of the independent central bank, which became the Bundesbank, was instrumental in Germany’s rising from the ashes of World War II and becoming the economic pillar of Europe.\n\nWho in this room isn’t grateful that Paul Volcker was a nuisance?\n\n“Audit the Fed” is nothing more than an attempt to override purely economic judgments and bend monetary policy to the will of politicians. It is misguided. I pray we don’t go there. I can think of nothing that would do more damage to our nation’s prosperity.\n\nWorms in Whiskey\n\nThat doesn’t mean we should be deaf to the drumbeat of concerns about the Fed.\n\nMy friend, former Sen. Sam Nunn, likes to tell the tale of a backwoods preacher who was alarmed at the drinking habits of one of his parishioners. So the preacher called the man in. He put two glasses in front of him, one filled with water and the other with whiskey. He then put a worm in the glass of water. It swam around merrily. He then lifted the worm and placed it into the whiskey-filled glass. It sank to the bottom, dead. “Son, do you get the message?” the preacher asked. “Yes sir, I do,” the parishioner replied. “If I drink whiskey, I won’t get worms.”\n\nLike the parishioner, I don’t think the Fed is getting the message.\n\nFirst, in this era of social media and über-transparency, we at the Fed need to learn to speak English, rather than “Fedspeak.” I have done my level best during my tenure at the Fed to speak plainly, always bearing in mind that when I speak as a Fed official, I am speaking to the American people whom we serve, not to a small group of economists or just to the mavens of Wall Street.\n\nThe best case of this I have experienced the past decade occurred in May 2012, when the Dallas Fed board of directors traveled to a joint meeting with the board of the St. Louis Fed. The chairman of my board at the time was Herb Kelleher, the puckish, iconic founder of Southwest Airlines. Of course, we flew to St. Louis on Southwest. True to form, after we reached cruising altitude, Herb took the microphone and said: “My name is Herb Kelleher, and I want to thank you for flying on the airline I founded.” Herb is beloved by the people who fly Southwest; enthusiastic cheers and applause erupted from the passengers. Then he said, “Since I have a captive audience, I want to tell you about the Federal Reserve. Today, you have on board one of the most important people in the global financial system … me! Well, not really me, but I am chairman of the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, and with me is the Bank’s president, who sits on the committee that decides the amount and the cost of your money.” He went on to explain what the FOMC does and what the Fed banks do, how they are structured and so on, punctuating his remarks with references to Wild Turkey Bourbon and other personal favorites.\n\nYou know the kind of folks who fly Southwest. They range from people dressed like you and me in suits and ties to work-by-the-sweat-of-your-brow folk dressed in bib overalls—like the one seated behind me with his wife. When Herb finished, again to a big round of applause and attaboys, the man behind me turned to his wife and said, “Ethel, if Herb Kelleher is involved with the Federal Reserve, why did we vote for Ron Paul?”\n\nTie Your Camel\n\nSecond, I think we at the Fed must fully and frontally address the concern of many who feel that too much power is concentrated in the New York Fed. I am a great admirer of Bill Dudley. I consider him a dear friend and a man of tremendous capacity both as a policymaker and as a regulator of the financial institutions in his district. And I have enormous respect for Simon Potter and the good women and men who work our trading desk, faithfully implementing the instructions they receive from the FOMC, which crafts the nation’s monetary policy. Yet I understand the suspicions that surround the New York Fed.\n\nThere is an ancient Arab saying that one should “trust in Allah but tie your camel.” I would suggest the following common-sense proposals for quelling concerns for securing our franchise as an independent Fed and, in fact, creating a more efficient policymaking and implementing process. Bill, you might not like these, but I think they are needed:\n\n1) We should rotate the vice chairmanship of the FOMC. Under the current structure, the president of the New York Fed is the FOMC’s permanent vice chair, which renders him the second-most-powerful person at the table, behind the Chair. The purpose of the FOMC is to decide policy and to instruct the New York trading desk to implement it by managing the Fed’s System Open Market Account and short-term trading operations. Having the New York Fed president as the FOMC’s vice chair gives the appearance of a conflict of interest. To correct this, I would rotate that position every two years to one of the other 11 Fed presidents.\n\nWe have a convenient mechanism for doing so: The 12 Fed presidents meet frequently to discuss operational matters under the Conference of Presidents. Remember, there are no operating entities at the Board of Governors in Washington; it is the 12 Banks that lend money through their discount windows, house the forces that examine banks, operate the vaults that keep safe the people’s cash, and so on. The Conference of Presidents rotates its chair among the presidents on a biennial basis. So I would simply have the chairman of the Conference of Presidents automatically become vice chair of the FOMC. This way, over the course of two years, the Federal Reserve representatives of all 50 states (and all congressional districts) would occupy the second-most-important slot on the FOMC, and any appearance of conflicted interest would disappear.\n\n2) With regard to regulation, the greatest concern appears to be the problem of regulatory capture by the largest and most powerful institutions, the so-called Systemically Important Financial Institutions, or SIFIs. We have instituted at the Board of Governors a powerful and, to my mind, extremely able and disciplined leader on regulatory matters, Governor Dan Tarullo. But if that alone proves unsatisfactory to the Congress, a simple solution would be to have each of the SIFIs supervised and regulated by Federal Reserve Bank staff from a district other than the one in which the SIFI is headquartered. Each of the Fed Banks has an able body of examiners. With a tough central disciplinary authority in Washington dispatching those troops to districts where SIFIs are concentrated, we might eliminate any perception of conflicted interest and, again, assure that regulators from all 12 Federal Reserve districts, rather than from just two cities, are deployed in maintaining the safety and soundness of our banking system.\n\nThose are the two suggestions I thought would be most offensive to this New York audience!\n\nAnd I have a third and fourth:\n\n3) I would give the Federal Reserve Bank presidents an equal number of votes as the Washington-based governors, save the Chair.\n\nPresently, the New York Fed gets a permanent vote and the remaining 11 Banks get four votes, with Cleveland and Chicago voting every two years and the rest voting every three years. This makes no sense to me. The population of the New York Federal Reserve district is smaller than that of the San Francisco, Atlanta, Chicago, Richmond and Dallas districts. The Cleveland district is much smaller than New York’s, roughly equal to that of Kansas City, and only slightly larger than that of St. Louis, Boston and Philadelphia—each of which has 6 percent or less of the country’s population. (Minneapolis is the smallest district, with fewer than 3 percent of the nation’s population and roughly 1 percent of the Federal Reserve’s deposits.)\n\nAnd if you look at population growth, it is clear that the districts that get to vote most often are not the ones that are growing but the regions that were most prominent generations ago. Since 1970, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s district has grown in population by less than 7 percent, New York’s by 9 percent and Chicago’s by 18 percent. At the other end of the spectrum, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’ district has grown by 123 percent, San Francisco’s by 112 percent, Atlanta’s by 105 percent and Richmond’s by almost 70 percent.\n\nThe current voting schedule makes no sense to me. But I wouldn’t necessarily change it simply to avenge the past. I would change it to balance out the division of power between the Federal Reserve Banks that are out in the field and among the people and businesses that operate our economy and have their own independent research staffs, and the Board of Governors, which is Beltway bound geographically and is briefed and guided by a single staff. I have great admiration for the brilliance and integrity of the members of the Board of Governors research staff. But you will notice that for at least a couple of decades, the governors have tended to vote in a block, and it brings to mind Peter Weir’s romantic comedy Green Card, where the character played by Gerard Depardieu chastises the woman played by Andie MacDowell, saying, “You get all your opinions from the same place.” The members of the Board get their opinions from the same staff; the Fed bankers who sit at the FOMC table get theirs from 12 disparate staffs of the same high quality as that which resides in Washington.\n\nI would give six Banks the vote to match the six governors other than the Chair. The next year, the other six would have the vote. The Chair would then be the tiebreaker if a tie were to ensue, though given the collegial way in which we conduct our deliberations, my guess is that a tiebreaker would be a rarity. Thus, over a two-year stretch, all 50 states and all congressional districts would have someone representing their constituents sitting as a voter at the table. Every year, six Fed Banks whose presidents serve under boards of directors chosen from within the states in their districts would match wits with Fed governors appointed by presidents and approved by Congress, providing a balance between what some might consider representatives of Main Street and Washington factotums. To me, this is eminently sensible.\n\n4) Fourth and finally, I would have the Chair hold a press conference after every FOMC meeting. I have long advocated this. Presently, the Chair holds a press conference every quarter. In effect, this means that any change in monetary policy can be made only at a quarter’s end. (For if we were to suddenly announce that in between quarter ‘X’ and quarter ‘Y’ the Chair was going to hold a press conference, it might spook and destabilize the markets). In the parlance of economics, this injects some time-dependency into our deliberations when we should be guided in making policy strictly by the state of the economy, and take action on monetary policy when it is needed. I believe the Chair should hold a press conference after every meeting to explain the whys and wherefores of the policy decision taken by the committee. This would both add transparency and give the FOMC greater leeway in implementing policy. For the record, I have been arguing for this for years now.\n\nMonetary Alzheimer’s\n\nIn the interest of time, I am going to make some additional, abbreviated suggestions, based on my decade at the Fed.\n\nPolicymakers must be rigorous in their analysis but must be guided by common sense. We have developed very sophisticated models of the economy at the Fed, and they are useful in providing a framework for deliberation. Yet they are always at risk of becoming stale or inappropriate to the situation. My advice is to heed Charles Kindleberger’s warning that “different circumstances call for different prescriptions.” “The art of economics,” he said, “is to choose the right model for the given problem, and to abandon it when the problem changes shape.”[4]\n\nRight now, we are trying to understand the dynamics of inflation. We have declared a 2 percent intermediate target for inflation, which seems to be standard for most central banks. Headline inflation measures show a significant shortfall from that target. The headline personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index fell 0.2 percent in December. Its 12-month increase was 0.75 percent, down from 1.6 percent in June. Should this low, and still falling, rate of price inflation retard the date of the liftoff from the zero-interest-rate policy we have been operating for more than six years?\n\nI think not. We all know that headline inflation is being held down by the big decline in energy prices that began in the second half of 2014. We know that once energy prices stabilize, headline inflation is likely to bounce right back up. Policy needs to take past inflation into account, but it needs to take future inflation into account, too. That’s just another way of saying that, for policy purposes, it’s inflation’s medium-term trend that matters—which is why analysts and policymakers pay so much attention to core inflation measures. The widely heralded FRB/US model that has been used by the Board of Governors staff since 1996 is an example: It is built around PCE inflation excluding food and energy—which is the traditional measure of core inflation. Ex-food-and-energy PCE inflation was essentially zero in December, month over month, while the 12-month rate slipped to 1.3 percent from 1.5 percent in June.\n\nHere’s where that Kindleberger quote is relevant. A good core inflation measure strips the noise out of headline inflation and leaves the signal. By that standard, recent analysis shows that the ex-food-and-energy PCE inflation rate that drives the FRB/US inflation forecast is a second-rate core inflation measure, at best. An alternative measure developed at the Dallas Fed—the Trimmed Mean PCE—is superior in three respects.\n\nFirst, trimmed mean inflation is better insulated from transitory energy-price swings. Since 1994 (the start of the current 2 percent-inflation era), conventional core inflation’s correlation with changes in the real price of oil is 0.26, while trimmed mean inflation’s correlation is just 0.05.\n\nSecond, as judged by root-mean-square error (sorry, but I do have to drop a little Fedspeak economic jargon here), it is more closely aligned with intuitive, direct measures of trend headline inflation—like the 36-month centered average, or headline inflation’s average over the coming 24-month period—that we are only able to observe after the fact.[5]\n\nThird, trimmed mean inflation has shown substantially less systematic bias. Over the past 10 years, looking only at data that would have been available to policymakers in real time, conventional core PCE inflation has averaged 1.65 percent—nearly 30 basis points below headline inflation’s 1.94 percent average. Meanwhile, trimmed mean inflation has come in at 1.83 percent—just 10 basis points below headline. Setting policy using conventional core as your guide is like navigating using a compass: It has a systematic bias and is influenced by local anomalies in the Earth’s magnetic field. Using the trimmed mean to set policy is more akin to navigating by GPS.\n\nIf you go to the Dallas Fed website, you will see our most recent posting: The 12-month trimmed mean rate held steady in December, staying within the 1.6 to 1.7 percent range it’s occupied every month since April 2014. That’s a lower range than we’re shooting for, but a whole lot less discouraging than an inflation reading of 0.75 percent or even 1.3 percent.\n\nUnemployment trends give us additional reason not to be overly concerned about the current inflation shortfall.\n\nRecently, Pope Francis gave a stern lecture to the College of Cardinals about the risks of what he termed “spiritual Alzheimer’s.” I worry that the FOMC, preoccupied with its 2 percent inflation target and understandably shy about moving too soon to lift off from the “zero bound,” is at risk of “monetary Alzheimer’s.”\n\nMy chief policy advisor, Evan Koenig, and I, and our Dallas research colleagues Anil Kumar and Pia Orrenius have authored papers that show the Phillips curve—the relationship between unemployment and wage growth—is not linear but convex, meaning that wage growth initially picks up slowly in response to unemployment rate declines, but as you approach maximum employment, inflation turns upward with increasing intensity. Up to now, we’ve been in picks-up-slowly territory, with wage and salary inflation rising 0.2 percentage points each year, from 1.5 percent in 2011, to 1.7 percent in 2012, to 1.9 percent in 2013 and to 2.1 percent in 2014. But if historical patterns hold, we’ll see larger and larger increments to wage inflation going forward.\n\nInflation responds to slack with a long lag in today’s world, where—thanks greatly to the efforts of Paul Volcker—confidence in the Federal Reserve’s commitment to price stability is strong. It’s easy for policymakers to take that confidence for granted, and understandable that they would want to push hard against real resource constraints in an effort to spread prosperity more broadly. However, as I have repeatedly reminded my FOMC colleagues, every single time the Fed has waited for full employment to be achieved before starting to withdraw accommodation, it has ended up driving the economy into recession. When policymakers get too clever by half, the public pays a steep price.\n\nI liken monetary policy to piloting a ship, as I learned to do at the Naval Academy. When you are at the conn—at the wheel of a large ship—you begin to slow down miles before you reach your intended destination. There are no brakes you can slam on to make a sudden stop. Ship velocity, like monetary policy, operates with a lag. If we wait to see the whites of the eyes of full employment and then have to raise rates sharply, I believe it will shock the economy and invite an adverse reaction. So, taking a page from Pope Francis, I hope we don’t forget the past and will remember that the wisest policy option has proven to be early and gentle interest rate increases as we approach full employment.\n\nSecretariat\n\nDuring the financial crisis, I said we were “the best-looking horse in the glue factory.” The outlook was bleak everywhere, and we were hobbling along on unsure legs. Now, thanks in part to accommodative monetary policy and the indestructible force of American entrepreneurialism, most vividly demonstrated by George Mitchell and other innovators in the energy sector, and with no thanks to fiscal and regulatory shenanigans by a feckless Congress and White House, the U.S. economy is now racing down the track.\n\nOur businesses used the downturn to tighten their expense structures and ramp up productivity and efficiency. They have used the accommodative monetary policy of the Fed and the abnormally low interest rates the Fed has engineered to clean up their balance sheets, replacing existing debt with lower-cost debt and also tightening up their equity structures, buying back shares and improving shareholder satisfaction by paying out higher dividends. During the depth of the crisis, one of my most esteemed colleagues on the FOMC noted that, looking at our banks’ balance sheets, “nothing on the right was right and nothing on the left was left.” Now both sides of the balance sheets of most U.S. companies, as well as banks, are healthier than they have been in decades.\n\nHere is the point: Thanks to the Fed’s monetary policy and to their own ingenuity, private businesses in the U.S.A.—those that create real, lasting jobs—are well-groomed and fit and ready to run faster around the global track than the businesses of any other country.\n\nSo let me conclude with the visual that I believe embodies the potential of our economy: that of Secretariat at the Belmont Stakes in 1973. And let me remind you that despite all the naysayers and doomsayers—those who said Europe would lap America, that Japan would lap America, that China would lap America, that the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India and China) would lap America, that America could not compete with the masses of low-cost labor that were unleashed in China and India and elsewhere by the end of the Cold War and with the advent of globalization—we are No. 1. The U.S. and its North American Free Trade Agreement partners, Mexico and Canada, form the most dynamic growth region of the world. We are Secretariat, and we can win the global economic race by 31 lengths if only we are given freer rein by fiscal and regulatory authorities.\n\n\n\nG-6 to Gee Whiz\n\nI was a child of the Cold War. We lived then under the threat of mutually assured destruction. The Wall came down. The Soviet Union disintegrated. Mao died. Communism was swept into the dustbin of history. Sure, we have the group formerly known as ISIS and the Taliban and other perpetrators of evil. But the great powers have turned from mutually assured destruction to mutually assured competition. When I was sent by Bob Roosa to work in the Carter administration and learn, in his words, “how government can screw things up,” we had a G-6—ourselves and five nations that we interfaced with economically: Canada, England, France, Italy and Germany. Now we have a Gee Whiz. There is a G-20, a G-30, a World Trade Organization and so on. We won! Every nation wants in on the economic prosperity; every nation wants to compete to better the living standards of its people.\n\nWe paid with precious blood and treasure to win the Cold War and create a world of mutually assured competition. And there is no country, no people, nobody anywhere on this planet who can outpace us. Nobody. Period.\n\nThank you.\n\nAnd now, in the spirit of what every signatory to S. 264 worries about, I’d be happy to avoid answering your questions.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "November 30, 2016 New York City\n\nThank you for having me here today at the Economic Club of New York.\n\nI spent 23 years working on Wall Street. Much of my business career and many of my nonprofit activities have been based in this city. Many of my closest friends and mentors live in New York, and some are in attendance this morning. So I am very glad to be visiting with you here today.\n\nAs most of you know, I have been president and CEO of the Dallas Fed since September 2015. In this role, I have now participated in 10 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings and am firmly ensconced in performing the key duties of a Federal Reserve Bank president. In that regard, I have spent a substantial amount of time getting to know business and community leaders throughout the Eleventh District and have developed good working relationships with the other Federal Reserve Bank presidents and the Board of Governors.\n\nThe Dallas Fed is one of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks in the United States. We represent the Eleventh District, which is composed of Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico.\n\nAs you probably also know, Texas now accounts for 8.7 percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP).[1] It is the largest exporting state in the U.S. and is home to 52 Fortune 500 companies. The characteristics of our district help give the Dallas Fed excellent insight into energy, trade, immigration and other key aspects of the regional, national and global economies.\n\nToday, I would like to speak with you about my assessment of economic conditions as well as my views regarding monetary policy. After that, I will look forward to taking your questions.\n\nDiscussion of Economic Conditions\n\nLet me begin my remarks by talking about energy, given its importance to the Eleventh District as well as the United States. As you know, energy prices have substantially declined since June of 2014. In early 2014, the mining sector, composed substantially of oil and gas exploration and services, accounted for approximately 2.8 percent of U.S. GDP. By early 2016, the sector had declined to approximately 1.3 percent of GDP.[2]\n\nAt the Dallas Fed, we believe that global oil production and consumption will get into rough balance by sometime in the first half of 2017. This balancing process could be accelerated if there is a more explicit agreement worked out between OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) nations to limit production levels.\n\nWhile there are varying estimates of the timing of reaching balance, we believe that the overall trend is the key—we are moving toward balance. Our analysis is based on the expectation that global oil supply will grow at a slower rate and that daily demand will continue to grow, on average, at approximately 1.3 million barrels per day for the remainder of 2016 and at a similar rate in 2017.\n\nThis balancing process has been more painful and slower than some had anticipated. While average daily U.S. oil production has declined by as much as 1 million barrels over the past year, this decline has been more than offset by production increases in Iran, Saudi Arabia, Russia and other countries. As a result of these developments, global oil supply reductions have been slow to materialize, and excess inventories of oil products now stand at record-high levels.\n\nAs we look ahead to 2017 and 2018, we expect to see continued price volatility. However, as the market moves toward balance, we expect to see excess inventories stabilize and then begin to decline, and prices continue to firm. Despite this firming, we expect to see more bankruptcies, restructurings and merger activity in the energy sector in the U.S. While rig count has increased over the past few months, based on our energy surveys and discussions with market participants, we believe that rig count is unlikely to increase significantly in the U.S. until prices rise to between $55 and $65 per barrel.\n\nA weak energy sector and a stronger dollar have created headwinds for our district. The rate of job growth in Texas for the first half of 2016 was just below 1 percent. We saw continuing job losses in energy as well as weakness in the state’s manufacturing sector and slowing growth in its service sector. However, as the headwinds from energy begin to subside, we are starting to experience faster growth. In this regard, we now expect to see approximately 2 percent job growth in the second half of 2016 and a similar rate of growth in 2017.\n\nTexas continues to benefit from the migration of people and firms to the state. The population in Texas stood at approximately 27.5 million in 2015 versus 22.8 million in 2005.[3] As a result of an increasingly diversified economy as well as continued migration of people and firms to the state, I am very optimistic about the growth prospects for Texas and the Eleventh District in the months and years ahead.\n\nU.S. GDP growth in the first half of 2016 was a disappointing 1.1 percent.[4] Underpinning this weak growth was the financial turmoil in the first quarter of this year as well as a sizable inventory deceleration in the second quarter. Estimates of third-quarter GDP growth now show an improvement to 3.2 percent. Based on these estimates and our confidence in the strength of the U.S. consumer, we now expect full-year 2016 GDP growth of approximately 2 percent.\n\nThis is sluggish growth by historical standards but should still be sufficient to continue to drive down the unemployment rate and remove slack from the labor market. In assessing labor slack, we look at the headline rate of unemployment of 4.9 percent, but we also track the participation rate, estimates of the number of people working part time for economic reasons and other measures of labor market utilization. The participation rate stands at 62.8 percent versus 66 percent in 2007.[5] Our economists at the Dallas Fed believe that much of this decline is due to changes in demographics—that is, workers are aging out of the labor force. This trend is expected to continue in the U.S. as well as almost all advanced economies. For example, within the next 10 years, we expect the participation rate to fall below 61 percent if no mitigating actions are taken.[6] Without a material improvement in the rate of U.S. productivity growth, this trend is likely to have significant negative implications for future potential GDP growth.\n\nRegarding inflation, our Dallas Fed economists track headline inflation and other measures of core inflation, including the Dallas Fed’s Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate. This measure trims out the most extreme upward and downward monthly price movements. It has been running consistently at 1.7 percent since the start of 2016, up from 1.6 percent in 2015. The stability and trend of this measure gives us confidence that the headline inflation rate should gradually reach the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target in the medium term. Progress in reaching this objective has been frustratingly slow over the past few years.\n\nIn assessing economic conditions in the U.S., my research team is closely monitoring economic developments outside the U.S. to assess how these developments might impact economic growth domestically. In this regard, we are closely watching the impact of Brexit on the U.K. and European economies as well as monitoring the risk of contagion. At this stage, I believe that the impact of Brexit is likely to be very manageable for the U.S.\n\nOur Dallas Fed research team is also monitoring emerging-market countries, particularly China. China has a high degree of overcapacity (particularly in state-owned enterprises), high and growing levels of debt, and is in the midst of a multiyear transition from being a manufacturing- and export-driven economy to one that is based on consumer spending and services. We think this transition is likely to take many years, and the world is going to have to become accustomed to lower rates of Chinese growth. This deceleration, coupled with high levels of debt, is likely to create currency volatility and make global markets more vulnerable to periodic bouts of turmoil—which could have the potential to tighten global financial conditions.\n\nBroader Secular Trends\n\nIn addition to monitoring key cyclical trends in the economy, I also closely monitor more persistent secular drivers, which help explain shorter-term economic results. I am particularly focused on four key drivers:\n\nImplications for Monetary Policy\n\nAs you know, the Fed has a mandate to pursue full employment and price stability. Regarding our full-employment objective, as I just discussed, I believe we are making good progress toward reaching our goal. I do believe that, in a more interconnected world, labor slack should be assessed in a global context. Excess capacity outside the U.S. may be dampening inflation pressures in the U.S. As a result, I think we may still have some capacity for further job growth without overheating the economy or unduly stressing the capacity of the U.S. workforce.\n\nIn terms of price stability, even though headline inflation continues to run below our 2 percent objective, I believe that, as the impacts of lower energy prices and a stronger dollar begin to dissipate and as the labor market continues to tighten, headline inflation will likely trend toward our 2 percent objective in the medium term.\n\nIn light of the challenges posed by the broad secular drivers I discussed earlier, I have been suggesting that removal of accommodation should be done gradually and patiently. I am cognizant that, from a risk-management point of view, our monetary policy tools are asymmetrical at or near the zero lower bound—that is, it is easier to tighten policy than to ease policy at this point in the normalization process.\n\nLastly, I have repeatedly stated that I believe it is important that we strive to take steps to “normalize” monetary policy because there is a cost to excessive accommodation in terms of penalizing savers, as well as creating potential distortions and imbalances in asset allocation, investing, hiring and other business decisions. These imbalances are often easier to recognize in hindsight and can be very painful to address.\n\nBased on these considerations, as we continue to make progress in achieving our dual mandate, I would advocate that we take action to remove some amounts of accommodation.\n\nLet me now turn to a discussion of the appropriate role of monetary policy.\n\nThe Role of Monetary Policy\n\nAs you know, the target range for the federal funds rate stands at 25 to 50 basis points. It is worth noting that the last time short-term interest rates in the United States were this low was during the middle and late 1930s as the U.S. struggled to emerge from the Great Depression. While policy rates are historically low, real government bond yields—returns after inflation—are also at historically low levels across a wide swath of countries, including the United States.\n\nA major driver of these historically low rates is the decline in expectations for future economic growth. As I have discussed, key persistent trends—particularly aging-workforce demographics, as well as weak productivity growth—are having a negative impact on growth prospects in the U.S. as well as in most other advanced economies. An additional likely reason for the persistence of low interest rates is the emergence of the U.S. as a chief supplier of safe assets to the world. In an increasingly financially interconnected world, the search for safety and return occurs globally—which means that low rates in one country can quickly impact interest rates in other countries.\n\nMonetary policy has a key role to play in economic policy. However, at or near the zero lower bound, it may be less effective than other tools of economic policy. Monetary policy is not designed, by itself, to address the key structural issues we face today stemming from demographic changes, lower levels of productivity growth, high levels of debt to GDP, as well as the dislocations created by globalization and increasing rates of technology-enabled economic disruption. While monetary policy certainly has a key role to play, it is not a substitute for actions that could address more fundamental economic challenges.\n\nFor the past eight years, in the aftermath of the Great Recession, advanced economies have relied heavily on monetary policy and much less on structural reforms and fiscal policy. However, at this stage, if we are going to generate higher sustainable rates of GDP growth and address key secular challenges, there needs to be policy action beyond monetary policy. This action could take a variety of forms.\n\nPotential Policy Actions Beyond Monetary Policy\n\nGiven that aging-workforce demographics are expected to create headwinds for future economic growth, more could be done to explore policies that could grow the workforce in the years ahead. Appropriate immigration policy is likely to be a key element of this effort. Historically, immigration has played an important role in economic growth in the U.S. It is estimated that immigrants and their children have comprised more than half of the growth in the labor force in the U.S. over the past two decades.[8]\n\nPolicies that involve greater emphasis on improving levels of educational attainment are likely to be critical in order to ensure that an increasing percentage of our population can become more productive members of the workforce. Options for improving educational attainment could include beefing up public/private partnerships that focus on vocational training that equips workers for technical and other skill-based opportunities of the 21st century. These programs could help to grow the workforce and address the skills gap that has been identified by numerous companies we speak with in the Eleventh District.\n\nPublic investments that upgrade aging infrastructure could potentially improve productivity and help bolster sluggish demand. Given the sizable private pools of capital that exist today, some meaningful portion of this investment could come from public/private partnerships, with substantial capital coming from the private sector.\n\nMore broadly, tax reform and regulatory policies could be considered in order to create increased incentives for growth and investment, which might ultimately improve future rates of GDP growth. Improved growth expectations could help to counter the forces holding down global interest rates, giving monetary policy makers greater scope for action without resorting to unconventional tools.\n\nSome observers suggest conducting a comprehensive review of regulations at the national, state and local levels. They argue that, in some cases, excessive regulation and fees might be creating undue burdens on capital investment, lending and the formation and growth of small businesses. This may help explain why business investment and small-business formation have been disappointing over the past several years.\n\nEntitlement reforms, which involve strengthening Social Security and Medicare without jeopardizing potential benefits for those already 55 or older, could help improve the sustainability and ease the future fiscal burden of these programs. In addition, reforms might reduce current disincentives to remain in the labor force while helping to soften the impact of aging-workforce demographic trends on growth and interest rates. Such reforms, insofar as they ease long-term concerns regarding the sustainability of future government debt burdens (as a percentage of GDP), might also reduce uncertainty about future tax rates and boost growth expectations through that channel.\n\nThese are some examples of policy actions that could be considered. There are certainly other examples, including efforts to implement more comprehensive trade reforms, which could create a more level global playing field for the movement of goods and services. Policymakers would need to address which of these options might make sense to pursue—but my point is that some of these actions will be necessary to address the fundamental challenges we currently face.\n\nClosing\n\nMonetary policy is a key element of economic policy—but it shouldn’t be the only element of policy. To improve future economic outcomes for our citizens, we need to consider structural and fiscal policies alongside sound monetary policy.\n\nIt has been a pleasure speaking with you today. I would now be happy to take your questions.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "November 4, 2016Mexico City\n\nThank you for having me here today at the Asociación de Bancos de Mexico.\n\nMexico is a very important partner to the United States, and there is a long history of close relations between the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and the Banco de México as well as with the broader leadership of Mexico. In particular, I would like to thank Agustín Carstens for his warm hospitality and outstanding efforts to build a strong relationship with the Dallas Fed over the past several years.\n\nAs most of you know, the Dallas Fed is one of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks in the United States. We represent the Eleventh District, which is comprised of Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico. This territory includes 74 percent of the 1,933 miles that comprise the U.S.–Mexico border.\n\nAs you probably also know, Texas is the largest exporting state in the U.S., and Mexico is our number one trading partner.[1] A majority of Texas immigrants come from Mexico.[2] In addition, cross-border investment is a key element of economic development in our region. So, building our relationship is critically important—which is why I am very glad to be here today and why I look forward to working with you for many years to come.\n\nToday, I would like to talk briefly about the close ties between Mexico and the United States. I would then like to discuss my assessment of economic conditions as well as the appropriate role of monetary policy in addressing key economic challenges we face. Then, I look forward to taking your questions.\n\nThe Mexico–U.S. Relationship\n\nSince the implementation of NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement), trade between the U.S. and Mexico has grown from approximately $159 billion in 1994 to over $532 billion in 2015. According to U.S. government estimates, approximately 45 percent of this represents U.S. exports to Mexico, and the remaining 55 percent represents imports from Mexico to the U.S.[3] Approximately 81 percent of Mexico’s exports in 2015 went to the U.S.[4]\n\nIncreased bilateral trade and production sharing between the U.S. and Mexico has resulted in stronger economic integration, rising foreign direct investment and increasing business-cycle synchronization. For example, estimates indicate that approximately 40 percent of content in U.S. imports from Mexico originates in the U.S.[5]\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, Mexico is the number one destination for Texas exports. In 2015, Texas exported approximately $92.5 billion of goods to Mexico.[6] Dallas Fed research indicates that trading collaboration with Mexico has materially improved Texas’ global competitiveness.[7]\n\nToday, many Texas border cities benefit from increased U.S.–Mexico economic integration. Roberto Coronado is head of the El Paso branch of the Dallas Fed and has done extensive work trying to better understand this economic integration. His research suggests that growth in manufacturing activity in northern Mexico has generated substantial job growth in border cities such as El Paso and McAllen.[8] Job gains have been concentrated in services and transportation, resulting in better wages and improved standards of living for Texas border residents.[9]\n\nThe U.S. is home to more immigrants from Mexico than from any other nation—approximately 12 million. Mexican-born immigrants account for 27 percent of all immigrants living in the U.S. and 55 percent of immigrants living in Texas.[10] Immigration has contributed substantially to labor force growth in the U.S. and Texas. It is estimated that immigrants and their children have comprised more than half of the growth in the labor force in the U.S. over the past two decades.[11] In Texas, foreign workers overall are estimated to have comprised over 40 percent of workforce growth between 1990 and 2010.[12]\n\nPia Orrenius leads our effort to understand immigration as well as broader economic conditions in the Eleventh District. Dallas Fed research indicates that highly skilled immigrants are substantially beneficial to the U.S. economy.[13] Related research suggests that these workers tend to patent at much higher rates than similarly educated natives, hence contributing disproportionately to innovation and productivity growth.[14] Further, immigrants tend to be more entrepreneurial than natives and have somewhat higher rates of self-employment.[15] Pia’s research suggests that, on average, Mexican immigrant education levels are rising, and increasing numbers are filling high-skilled jobs in the U.S.[16]\n\nOne further insight from Pia’s work is the fact that Mexico–U.S. migration has slowed since the Great Recession.[17] Net immigration flows between the two countries have been running close to zero over the past several years. This slowdown appears to have been driven primarily by improving economic conditions in Mexico relative to the U.S. In addition, the increase in dual-earner households, smaller average family size, the creation of a more substantial social safety net, as well as stronger domestic labor market prospects in Mexico have all worked to reduce the flow of migration to the U.S.\n\nI look forward to talking more about these subjects in the Q and A. But now, let me turn to a discussion of economic conditions in the Eleventh District as well as the U.S.\n\nDiscussion of Economic Conditions\n\nLet me begin my remarks by talking about energy, given its importance to the Eleventh District and Mexico as well as the United States. As you know, energy prices have substantially declined since June of 2014. This weakness has certainly created economic headwinds for Mexico as well as the Eleventh District economy.\n\nAt the Dallas Fed, we continue to believe that global oil production and consumption will get into rough balance by sometime in the first half of 2017. This balancing process could be helped if there is a more explicit agreement worked out between OPEC nations to limit production levels.\n\nWhile there are varying estimates of the timing of reaching balance, we believe that the overall trend is the key—we are moving toward balance. Our analysis is based on our expectation that global supply will grow at a slower rate and that daily demand will continue to grow, on average, at approximately 1.3 million barrels per day for the remainder of 2016 and in 2017.\n\nThis balancing process has been more painful and slower than some had anticipated. While average daily U.S. oil production has declined by as much as 1 million barrels over the past year, these declines have been more than offset by production increases in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Russia and other countries. As a result of these developments, global oil supply reductions have been slow to materialize, and excess inventories of oil products now stand at record-high levels.\n\nAs we look ahead to 2017 and 2018, we expect to see continued price volatility. However, as we move toward balance, we expect to see excess inventories begin to decline and prices continue to firm. Despite this firming, we expect to see more bankruptcies, restructurings and merger activity in the energy sector in the U.S. Based on our energy surveys and discussions with market participants, the rig count is unlikely to increase significantly in the U.S. until prices rise to between $55 and $65 per barrel.\n\nThe energy sector as well as a stronger dollar have created headwinds for our district. The rate of job growth in Texas for the first half of 2016 was just below 1 percent. We saw continuing job losses in energy as well as weakness in the state’s manufacturing sector and slowing growth in its service sector. However, as the headwinds from energy and the dollar have begun to subside, we are beginning to see faster growth. In this regard, we now expect to see approximately 2 percent job growth in the second half of 2016 as well as in 2017.\n\nTexas continues to benefit from migration of people and firms to the state. Population in Texas stood at approximately 27.5 million in 2015 versus 22.8 million in 2005.[18] We expect this trend to continue in 2017 and beyond.\n\nGDP growth in the first half of 2016 was a disappointing 1.1 percent.[19] Underpinning this weak growth was the financial turmoil in the first quarter of this year as well as a sizable inventory deceleration in the second quarter. Initial estimates of third quarter GDP growth show an improvement to 2.9 percent. Based on these estimates and our confidence in the strength of the U.S. consumer, we now expect full-year 2016 GDP growth of approximately 2 percent.\n\nThe October employment report showed a headline unemployment rate of 4.9 percent. Additionally, the October labor force participation rate stood at 62.8 percent versus 66 percent in 2007.[20] We at the Dallas Fed believe that much of this decline is due to changes in demographics—that is, workers are aging out of the labor force. This trend is expected to continue in the U.S. as well as almost all advanced economies. For example, within the next 10 years, we expect the participation rate to fall below 61 percent if no mitigating actions are taken. This trend has significant implications for potential GDP growth.\n\nRegarding inflation, our Dallas Fed economists track headline inflation and other measures of core inflation including the Dallas Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate. This measure trims out outlying price movements. It has been running consistently at 1.7 percent since the start of 2016, up from 1.6 percent in 2015. The stability and trend of this measure gives us confidence that the headline inflation rate should gradually reach our 2 percent target in the medium term. Progress in reaching this objective has been frustratingly slow over the last few years.\n\nIn assessing economic conditions in the U.S., my research team is closely monitoring economic developments outside the U.S. to assess how these developments might impact economic growth domestically. In this regard, we are closely watching the impact of BREXIT on the U.K and European economies as well as monitoring the risk of contagion. At this stage, I believe that the impact of BREXIT is likely to be very manageable for the U.S.\n\nOur Dallas Fed research team is also monitoring emerging-market countries, particularly China. China has a high degree of overcapacity (particularly in state-owned enterprises), high and growing levels of debt, and is in the midst of a multiyear transition from being a manufacturing- and export-driven economy to one that is based on consumer spending and services. We think this transition is likely to take many years, and the world is going to have to become accustomed to lower levels of Chinese growth. This deceleration coupled with high levels of debt is likely to make financial markets more vulnerable to periodic bouts of financial turmoil, which have the potential to tighten global financial conditions.\n\nBroader Secular Trends\n\nIn addition to monitoring key cyclical trends in the economy, I am also closely monitoring more persistent secular drivers, which help explain shorter-term economic results. I am particularly focused on four key drivers:\n\nThe Role of U.S. Monetary Policy and the Need for Structural Reforms and Broader Economic Policy\n\nThese secular trends are having an impact on economic conditions. They are, to a great extent, structural—that is, they are not easily addressed through monetary policy. This is one reason why I have suggested that, at this stage of the economic recovery, we need fiscal policy and structural reforms to join the menu of economic policy. Monetary policy is not designed, by itself, to address the key structural issues we face today. While monetary policy certainly has a key role to play, it is not a substitute for actions that address deeper fundamental challenges.\n\nFor example, given an aging population, we need to explore policies that could grow the workforce in the years ahead. This would likely involve greater emphasis on improving levels of educational attainment so as to raise the productivity of the U.S. workforce.\n\nOptions for improving educational attainment levels must include beefing up public/private partnerships that focus on vocational training that equips workers for technical and other skills-based opportunities of the 21st century. These programs could help grow the workforce and address the skills gap that has been identified by many companies we speak with in the Eleventh District.\n\nI also believe it makes sense to consider a range of public investments that upgrade aging infrastructure and could potentially improve productivity and help to bolster sluggish demand. Given the sizable private pools of capital that exist today, some meaningful portion of this investment could come from public/private partnerships, with substantial capital coming from the private sector.\n\nMore broadly, tax reform and regulatory policies could be considered in order to create greater incentives for capacity expansion and capital investment, which might ultimately improve future rates of GDP growth. Improved growth expectations could help to counter the forces holding down global interest rates, giving monetary policy makers greater scope for action without resorting to unconventional tools.\n\nSome observers suggest conducting a comprehensive review of regulations at the national, state and local levels. They argue that, in some cases, excessive regulation and fees might be creating undue burdens on capital investment, lending, and the formation and growth of small business. This may help explain why business investment and small-business formation have been disappointing over the past several years.\n\nEntitlement reforms, which involve strengthening Social Security and Medicare without jeopardizing potential benefits for those already 55 or older, could help improve the sustainability as well as ease the future fiscal burden of these programs. In addition, reforms might reduce current disincentives to remain in the labor force, while helping to soften the impact of aging demographic trends on growth and interest rates. Such reforms, insofar as they ease long-term concerns regarding the sustainability of future government debt burdens (as a percentage of GDP), might also reduce uncertainty about future tax rates and boost growth expectations through that channel.\n\nThese are some examples of policy actions that could be considered. There are certainly other examples, including efforts to implement more comprehensive trade reforms, which could help create a more level global playing field for the movement of goods and services.\n\nMonetary policy is a key element of economic policy—but it shouldn’t be the only element of policy. To improve future economic outcomes for our citizens, we need to consider structural and fiscal policies alongside sound monetary policy.\n\nClosing\n\nIt has been a pleasure speaking with you today. I look forward to working with you in the years ahead to build the relationship between our two countries.\n\nNow, I would be happy to take your questions.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "August 2, 2016 Beijing\n\nThank you for inviting me to speak with you. I have been coming to China regularly for the past 25 years. I’ve always enjoyed working with Chinese companies and getting to know leaders in this country. So, it’s a real pleasure for me to be here today.\n\nAs you know, I have been president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas since the beginning of September 2015. The Dallas Fed is one of the 12 regional banks in the Federal Reserve System. It has approximately 1,200 employees and oversees the Eleventh Federal Reserve District, which is comprised of Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico.\n\nAs head of the Dallas Fed, I participate in every meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which is the key monetary policy making body within the Federal Reserve System.\n\nToday, I’d like to speak with you about my assessment of economic conditions as well as my views regarding monetary policy. I will also discuss some of the key challenges facing policy makers in the years ahead.\n\nI’d like to start my remarks with a brief discussion of some of the larger secular issues that I see forming the broader context for our work.\n\nGlobalization\n\nThe world has become much more interconnected over the past several decades. Major companies have increasingly spread their operations throughout the world in order to serve customers and improve their competitiveness. As a result of this, S&P 500 companies now derive as much as 50 percent of their earnings from outside the United States.[1] While corporate revenue and profit growth have been enhanced by globalization, this trend has clearly created strains on cities and towns that have seen jobs and significant portions of key industries relocate to other geographic regions.\n\nAs global trade between countries has expanded, economic conditions in one nation now have a greater potential to impact economic conditions in other nations. These impacts are generally transmitted through the trade of goods and services as well as through capital flows and labor market dynamics.\n\nWhile economies are more globally connected, financial markets have also become much more interconnected. Investment portfolios are increasingly global, and asset allocators increasingly think internationally when making investment decisions. Because financial markets trade in real time, market strains or other challenges in one market now have the potential to rapidly affect currency, debt and equity markets globally.\n\nWe certainly saw the effects of this interconnectedness during the 2008–09 financial crisis. More recently, and on a much smaller scale, we saw how turmoil in currencies and local markets in certain countries in early 2016 helped lead to global market volatility and a rapid tightening of overall financial conditions. We are also seeing this trend in continuing increases in global investment demand for “safe” assets—particularly U.S. government securities.\n\nDemographics\n\nA second major challenge is demographics. The United States and other major economies, including Europe, Japan and China, are all facing the issue of aging populations. These demographic changes will bear directly on the rates of workforce participation and, in turn, impact rates of potential economic growth across the industrialized world.\n\nFor example, in the U.S., as the baby-boomer generation moves into retirement age, the fraction of the labor force age 55 or older is projected to increase from approximately 21.7 percent in 2014 to almost 25 percent in 2024.[2] Looking further ahead, the median age of the labor force is expected to rise steadily through 2060.\n\nAs you know, in China, the size of the working-age population peaked in 2014 as fertility rates have declined below the population replacement rate. The median age in China has increased from 22 in 1980 to 37 today and is estimated to be 50 by 2050. The Chinese working-age population as a share of total population is estimated to have peaked at 74 percent in 2011 and, based on current trends, is expected to fall to 59 percent by 2050.[3] This decline will create headwinds for the country’s future economic growth.\n\nHigh Levels of Debt to GDP\n\nWhile these demographic trends continue to unfold, it is also the case that the ratio of debt to gross domestic product (GDP) has increased in Japan, China and the U.K. as well as most major countries in Europe. In the U.S., for example, household balance sheets have improved since the financial crisis, but business debt to GDP is somewhat higher and government debt to GDP has also increased.\n\nWhile U.S. government debt held by the public is approximately 75 percent of GDP [4], it is estimated that the present value of unfunded “entitlements” is now in excess of $45 trillion.[5] These unfunded obligations will increasingly work their way into the annual budget deficit over the next five to 10 years and will tend to increase the U.S. budget deficit as a percentage of GDP.\n\nChina has also seen a significant increase in its debt levels. In the fourth quarter of 2015, Chinese nonfinancial debt to GDP was estimated at 255 percent (as compared to 148 percent at the end of 2008). This was composed of government debt of 44 percent, household debt of 40 percent and private nonfinancial debt of 171 percent.[6] This debt growth may prove to be unsustainable.\n\nIncreasing Rates of Disruption\n\nWhile these larger forces are unfolding, the rate of disruption in industry is increasing. More than ever before, consumers are able to use technology to rapidly compare prices for goods and services. New business models are emerging which offer products and services in a superior manner to older models. Amazon or Alibaba versus a retail store is a classic example.\n\nThese trends are encouraging companies to look for new ways to use technology to lower costs, improve productivity and enhance customer service. While the impacts can be hard to measure, I believe these changes are reducing the pricing power of companies and putting some degree of downward pressure on the prices of many types of goods and services. This, in turn, is affecting the way companies think about traditional capital spending and overall resource allocation.\n\nIt is difficult to fully determine the ultimate impacts of these secular trends on economic growth, labor market dynamics and price stability. However, I do believe that these underlying forces are likely to have a significant impact on economic conditions in the years ahead. These forces will also have significant implications for monetary as well as fiscal policy. As the world has become more complex, central bankers must work to better understand these issues in order to make sound judgments regarding monetary policy.\n\nWith this backdrop, let me turn to a discussion of the economic conditions in the Eleventh Federal Reserve District, the United States and the world. I will then talk about their implications for monetary policy.\n\nI’ll start with a discussion of energy because of its impact on the Eleventh District as well as its importance to the U.S. and the world.\n\nBased on analysis as well as discussions with industry contacts, our Dallas Fed economists believe that global oil production and consumption should move into rough balance by the first half of 2017. While there are varying estimates of the precise timing of this balancing process, the key to us is the trend—we are gradually moving toward balance. Our analysis is based on our expectation that global demand for oil will grow by approximately 1.3 million barrels per day, on average, in 2016.\n\nDespite significant cuts in capital spending and rig counts in the U.S., global supply reductions have been slow to materialize over the past year. As supply reductions in the U.S. have occurred, they have been more than offset by production increases in Iran, Russia and other nations.\n\nOver the past few months, market prices have likely been impacted by periodic supply disruptions, such as those which have occurred in Canada, Nigeria, Iraq and Kuwait. We believe that the bulk of these supply outages have now been restored.\n\nWe expect continued price volatility as we head into year-end. In addition, because many U.S. energy companies are highly leveraged or operate in areas where the breakeven cost of production is above current market prices, we expect to see more bankruptcies, mergers and restructurings in the energy industry during the remainder of 2016.\n\nThe challenges of the energy industry continue to create headwinds for our district. The oil and gas industry now accounts for approximately 2 percent of Texas employment [7] and 6 percent of its GDP [8] (versus 3 percent of employment and 13 percent of GDP in 2014).\n\nTexas has substantially diversified its economy over the past three decades and has also become the top exporting state in the U.S. Texas has benefited from a sustained migration of people and firms to the state. Since 2000, population growth in Texas has exceeded that of the nation by almost a full 1 percentage point per year. This growth and diversification has helped contribute to the resiliency of the state despite recent headwinds from lower energy prices and the negative impact on exports from a strong dollar.\n\nIn 2016, Dallas Fed economists expect Texas job growth of 0.5 percent, compared with 1.3 percent in 2015 and 3.7 percent in 2014.[9] Manufacturing in Texas remains weak, and some of this weakness has spread to the state’s service sector. Jobs declined across most sectors and regions in the first quarter when oil prices fell sharply and exports were weakened by a stronger dollar. However, in the second quarter, job growth rebounded and leading indicators improved in the state.\n\nAs the headwinds from energy and a strong dollar continue to dissipate, I am very optimistic about the growth prospects for Texas and the Eleventh District in the years ahead. My optimism is due particularly to the increasingly diversified nature of the Texas economy as well as the continued migration of people and firms to the state.\n\nGross Domestic Product and Employment\n\nEstimates of first and second quarter 2016 GDP growth in the U.S. have been disappointing. Despite this, Dallas Fed economists continue to expect that GDP will grow approximately 2 percent in 2016, based largely on our expectation of solid consumer demand.\n\nWhile the most recent revision of the May jobs report showed a net increase of only 11,000 jobs, the June report showed an increase of approximately 287,000 jobs.[10] The three-month average pace of growth was 147,000 jobs. This deceleration from last year’s 200,000-plus pace should not be unexpected as the economy has moved closer to full employment.\n\nThe labor force participation rate, which measures the population 16 and older that is either employed or actively looking for work, stands at 62.7 percent. The unemployment rate is now 4.9 percent, after five years of steady declines.[11]\n\nThe labor force participation rate is now 3.3 percentage points below its prerecession level. Dallas Fed economists believe that most of this decline is due to an aging population. It is our view that if current trends continue, the participation rate is likely to decline to below 61 percent by 2024.[12] This expected decline will have negative implications for future potential GDP growth in the U.S.\n\nInflation\n\nHeadline inflation continues to run below the 2 percent longer-run objective set by the Federal Reserve. The most recent PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) report indicated headline inflation of 0.9 on a 12-month basis, up from 0.3 percent one year ago.[13]\n\nIn addition to headline inflation, our economists carefully track measures of core inflation. In particular, we look at the Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean inflation rate, which trims out the most extreme upward and downward monthly price changes. This rate had been running between 1.6 and 1.7 percent on a yearly basis from early 2014 until the end of 2015. Since the start of 2016, it has edged up to roughly 1.8 percent. The stability and trend of this measure bolsters our confidence that headline inflation will reach 2 percent over the medium term as the effects of declining energy prices and a stronger dollar ultimately subside.\n\nWhile we are the central bank of the United States, it is critical to assess how global economic conditions impact domestic economic conditions. Estimates of global growth continue to be revised downward, and the composition of this growth continues to be uneven.\n\nBrazil, Russia and Venezuela are expected to remain in recession in 2016, while advanced economies are expected to show only modest growth. In addition, as you know, China continues to be challenged by overcapacity in key industries, high levels of debt to GDP and aging demographics as well as managing an initiative to transition from an export- and manufacturing-based economy to one that is more consumer and service-sector based. As China grapples with these issues, its future rates of GDP growth are likely to decline. As the world adjusts to these lower levels of growth, we will continue to carefully monitor the potential spillover effects on currencies as well as global financial conditions.\n\nWe will also continue to monitor and assess the implications of Brexit in the United Kingdom. While this decision has had some ripple effects on global financial markets (particularly regarding currencies and interest rates), it will take time for events to unfold before we know the ultimate impact of this decision on growth in the U.K., Europe and the rest of the world.\n\nI am closely monitoring how slowing growth, high levels of overcapacity and high levels of debt to GDP in major economies outside the U.S. might be impacting economic conditions in the U.S. I am also closely tracking how these issues might be affecting the slope of the U.S. Treasury yield curve as well as measures of tightness in financial conditions.\n\nIn light of these challenges, I have been suggesting that removal of accommodation should be done in a gradual and patient manner, based on a realistic assessment of progress toward achieving the Federal Reserve’s dual-mandate objectives regarding full employment and price stability. I am also very cognizant that, from a risk-management point of view, our monetary policies have an asymmetrical impact at or near the zero lower bound.\n\nAs you know, the target range for the federal funds rate stands at 25 to 50 basis points. The Federal Reserve raised the range by 25 basis points in December 2015 after seven years at the zero lower bound. Prolonged low rates, several rounds of quantitative easing and other extraordinary Fed policy actions came in response to the severe financial crisis and economic recession of 2008 and 2009.\n\nIt is worth noting that the last time short-term interest rates in the United States were this low was during the middle and late 1930s as the U.S. economy struggled to emerge from the Great Depression. In addition, government bond yields in Germany and Japan are actually negative, even at maturities over five years.[14] Real government bond yields—returns after inflation—are at or below zero across a wide swath of countries, including the United States. This situation has been accentuated in the aftermath of Brexit.\n\nAs central bankers, we aim for monetary policy to be accommodative when the economy is operating below full employment and trend inflation is below target. We typically begin to remove accommodation as we move closer to achieving those dual goals. When our full-employment and price-stability goals are in conflict, the FOMC makes an assessment of the “balance of risks” to the two objectives.\n\nWhile there are disagreements about how much slack remains in the labor market and about how best to gauge trend inflation, policy debates focus more fundamentally on how to gauge the appropriate level of tightness or accommodation in monetary policy. This, in turn, depends on judgments about the “neutral rate”—the rate that signifies the dividing line between an accommodative and a restrictive monetary policy. This debate is complicated by the fact that the neutral rate is “unobserved”—that is, we have to infer this rate based on observations of financial and economic data.\n\nEconomists and other forecasters have lowered their estimates of the longer-run neutral rate over the past several years. Yields on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) have also signaled a decline in the longer-run neutral real rate.[15]\n\nA major driver of the decline in the neutral rate is a decrease in estimates of future growth. Longer-run estimates of future GDP growth have been declining across most advanced economies. This growth slowdown has been mostly due to demographics, but weaker productivity growth also contributes significantly to this decline.\n\nAnother likely reason for the decline in the neutral rate is the emergence of the U.S. as chief supplier of safe assets to the world. In an increasingly interconnected world, the search for safety and return occurs globally—meaning that low rates in one country can quickly impact interest rates in other countries. Robert Hall of Stanford University and the Hoover Institution argues that the representation of risk-averse foreign investors in U.S. financial markets has increased and that this trend has contributed to downward pressure on the neutral real rate.[16]\n\nMy colleague John Williams, president of the San Francisco Fed, along with Thomas Laubach, on the staff of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, has estimated that, as of the end of the first quarter of 2016, the longer-run real neutral rate was approximately 0.2 percent.\n\nEvan Koenig and Alan Armen at the Dallas Fed estimate of the shorter-run real neutral rate was negative 1 percent as of the end of the second quarter of 2016. By this measure, the Fed was only modestly accommodative last quarter.\n\nWhile there are different approaches to measuring the neutral rate, it is clear that there has been a significant decline in estimates of the neutral rate over the past several years.\n\nI am strongly persuaded by arguments that aging demographics in advanced economies, slower productivity growth and the continued emergence of the U.S. as a source of safe assets have all contributed to the decline in the neutral rate. I also believe that high levels of debt to GDP in advanced economies and higher levels of political polarization have, at a minimum, limited the capacity of these countries to implement fiscal policy and structural reforms that could have stimulated higher rates of growth. This situation has, in turn, caused the neutral rate to be lower than it would be otherwise.\n\nIn light of the decline in the neutral rate, using monetary policy to help manage the economy has become more challenging.\n\nMonetary policy has a key role to play in economic policy. However, at or near the zero lower bound, it may be less effective than other tools of economic policy. Monetary policy is not designed, by itself, to address the key structural issues we face today stemming from demographic changes, lower rates of productivity growth and high levels of debt to GDP as well as dislocations created by globalization and increasing rates of economic disruption.\n\nFor the past eight years, advanced economies have relied heavily on monetary policy and much less on fiscal policy or structural reforms. However, at this stage, if we are going to generate higher sustainable rates of GDP growth and address key secular issues, there needs to be policy action beyond monetary policy. This action could take a variety of forms.\n\nIn the U.S., given that aging of the population is expected to continue to create headwinds for future economic growth, more could be done to examine policies that would ensure an inflow of workers to strengthen and grow the U.S. workforce. Appropriate immigration policy is a key element of this effort.\n\nPublic investments that upgrade aging infrastructure could help to bolster sluggish demand in the near term while boosting productivity in the long run. Given the sizable private pools of capital that exist today, some meaningful portion of this investment could come from public/private partnerships, with substantial capital coming from the private sector.\n\nMore broadly, tax reform and regulatory policies that create incentives for growth and investment could ultimately improve growth rates. Improved growth expectations could help counter the forces holding down the neutral real interest rate, giving monetary policy makers greater scope for action without resorting to unconventional tools.\n\nHistorically during economic downturns, fiscal policy has often been used to assist monetary policy. However, due to high levels of debt to GDP as well as political polarization, governments have had difficulty coming to consensus on such action.\n\nThese are some examples of policy actions that could be considered. There are certainly other examples, including comprehensive regulatory review at the national, state and local levels, as well efforts to implement more comprehensive trade policy. Policy makers would need to address which of these might make sense to pursue. Whichever choices these leaders prefer, my point is that some of these actions will be necessary to address the challenges we currently face.\n\nI believe advanced economies around the world are at the stage where structural reforms, fiscal policy and other government actions need to join the menu of economic policy. That is, to address several of the key challenges we face, there needs to be economic policy action beyond monetary policy. While there may be good reasons why monetary policy has been the primary policy action over the past several years, we are now at the point where policy makers must enter a new phase in our thinking and actions.\n\nWe need to think more expansively about how to generate higher rates of sustained GDP growth. Now, eight years after the Great Recession, we need to take a new and broader approach to our economic policy making.\n\nThank you. I look forward to taking your questions.\n\nNotes\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "June 23, 2016 New York\n\nThank you for inviting me to speak with you.\n\nI want to talk with you today about monetary policy—its proper role, how it’s currently positioned, and the challenges facing policy makers in the years ahead.\n\nLet me begin with a brief discussion of current economic conditions and the implications for monetary policy. I will then talk a bit about key issues facing economic policy makers.\n\nI’ll start with a discussion of energy because of its impact on the Eleventh Federal Reserve District as well as its importance to the nation and the world.\n\nBased on analysis as well as discussions with industry contacts, our Dallas Fed economists believe that global oil production and consumption will get into rough balance by early 2017. While there are varying estimates of the precise timing of this balancing process, the key to us is the trend—we are gradually moving toward balance. Our forecast is based on our expectation that global demand will grow by approximately 1.3 million barrels per day in 2016 as compared to 2015.[1]\n\nDespite significant cuts in capital spending and rig counts in the U.S., global supply reductions have been slow to materialize over the past year. As supply reductions in the U.S. have occurred, they have been more than offset by production increases in Iran, Russia and other nations.\n\nBased on a slowing rate of global supply growth (including significant supply cuts underway in the U.S.) as well as steady growth in demand, we expect excess oil inventories in OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries to begin to decline in the near future. Inventory drawdowns will also be impacted by periodic supply disruptions, such as those which have occurred in Canada, Nigeria, Iraq and Kuwait.\n\nAs a result of these trends, we would expect oil prices to continue to firm in the coming months. Even with prices firming, because many energy companies are highly leveraged or operate in areas where the breakeven cost of production is above current market prices, we expect to see more bankruptcies, mergers and restructurings in the energy industry during the remainder of 2016.\n\n(Note: Next week the Dallas Fed will release the results of its new quarterly energy survey. The survey samples nearly 200 upstream energy companies headquartered in the Eleventh District, many with national and global operations. Respondents will report on their expectations for oil and gas prices, production levels, cost information, employment, capital spending and the overall outlook.)\n\nThe Eleventh District is comprised of Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico. The challenges of the energy industry continue to create headwinds for our district. The industry now comprises approximately 2 percent of Texas employment[2] and 7 percent of its gross domestic product [3] (versus 3 percent of employment and 13 percent of GDP in 2014).\n\nTexas has substantially diversified its economy over the past three decades. Some of this diversification has occurred organically, and a significant portion has developed as a result of a sustained migration of people and firms to the state. Since 2000, population growth in Texas has exceeded that of the nation by a full 1 percentage point per year. This growth and diversification has helped contribute to the resiliency of the state despite recent headwinds from lower energy prices and a strong dollar.\n\nIn 2016, Dallas Fed economists expect Texas job growth of 1.3 percent—the same as in 2015, but down from 3.7 percent in 2014.[4] Manufacturing in Texas remains weak, but the state’s service sector continues to show steady growth. While Houston and other energy-sensitive cities continue to face economic headwinds, Dallas, San Antonio and Austin are growing at healthy rates.\n\nDue to an increasingly diversified economy as well as continued migration of people and firms to Texas, I am very optimistic about the growth prospects for Texas and the Eleventh District in the years ahead—particularly as the headwinds from energy and a strong dollar continue to dissipate.\n\nGross Domestic Product and Employment\n\nEstimates of first quarter 2016 GDP growth were disappointing. In addition, the recently released May jobs report showed a net increase of only 38,000 jobs.[5]\n\nThe labor force participation rate, which measures the population 16 and older that is either employed or actively looking for work, declined from approximately 62.8 percent to 62.6 percent.[6] While the unemployment rate fell to 4.7 percent,[7] the decline was driven primarily by the reduction in the participation rate.\n\nDespite this most recent information, Dallas Fed economists continue to expect that GDP will grow approximately 2 percent in 2016. This forecast is based on our expectation of strong consumer demand in the U.S.\n\nAt this stage in the economic cycle, it is our updated view that job growth of between 60,000 to 120,000 per month will be necessary to keep the unemployment rate constant, depending on changes in the labor force participation rate.\n\nThe labor force participation rate is now 3.4 percentage points below its prerecession level. Dallas Fed economists believe that most of this decline is due to an aging population. It is our view that if current trends continue, the participation rate is likely to decline to below 61 percent by 2024.[8] This expected decline will have negative implications for future potential GDP growth in the U.S.\n\nInflation\n\nHeadline inflation continues to run below the 2 percent longer-run objective set by the Federal Reserve. The most recent PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) report indicated headline inflation of 1.1 percent on a 12-month basis.[9]\n\nIn addition to headline inflation, our economists carefully track measures of core inflation. In particular, we look at the Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean inflation rate, which trims out the most extreme upward and downward monthly price changes. This rate had been running between 1.6 and 1.7 percent from early 2014 until the end of 2015. Since the start of this year, it has edged up to between 1.8 and 1.9 percent. The stability and trend of this measure bolsters our confidence that headline inflation will reach 2 percent over the medium term as the effects of declining energy prices and a stronger dollar ultimately subside.\n\nWhile we are the central bank of the United States, it is critical to assess how global economic conditions impact domestic economic conditions. Estimates of non-U.S. growth continue to be revised downward, and the composition of this growth continues to be uneven.\n\nBrazil, Russia and Venezuela remain in recession in 2016 while advanced economies show modest but steady growth. One particular concern is China, which continues to be challenged by overcapacity in key industries, high levels of debt to GDP, aging demographics as well as an initiative to transition its economy from one that is heavily export and manufacturing based to one that is more consumer and service-sector based.\n\nAs China grapples with these issues, its future rates of GDP growth are likely to decline. As the world adjusts to these lower levels of growth, China may be vulnerable to periodic bouts of currency and financial turmoil, which have the potential to trigger a tightening of conditions across global financial markets. We saw this unfold in January and February when the devaluation of the Chinese currency was accompanied by a steep selloff in Chinese markets, which then transmitted to a tightening in global financial conditions. We will continue to carefully monitor this situation as it unfolds over the next several years.\n\nAs you know, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left policy unchanged at our recent June meeting.\n\nIn the coming weeks, I will be carefully assessing incoming economic data in order to gauge our progress towards achieving our dual mandate objectives regarding full employment and price stability.\n\nI am closely monitoring how slowing growth, high levels of overcapacity and high levels of debt to GDP in advanced economies outside the U.S. might be impacting economic conditions in the U.S. I am also closely tracking how these issues might be affecting the slope of the U.S. Treasury yield curve as well as measures of tightness in financial conditions.\n\nIn light of these challenges, I have been suggesting that removal of accommodation should be done in a gradual and patient manner, based on a realistic assessment of economic conditions. I am also very cognizant that, from a risk management point of view, our monetary policies have an asymmetrical impact at or near the zero lower bound.\n\nWith that overview, let me turn to a broader discussion of the role of monetary policy.\n\nAs you know, the target range for the federal funds rate stands at 25 to 50 basis points. The Federal Reserve raised the range by 25 basis points in December 2015 after seven years at the zero lower bound. Prolonged low rates, several rounds of quantitative easing and other extraordinary Fed policy actions came in response to the severe financial crisis and economic recession of 2008 and 2009.\n\nIt is worth noting that the last time that short-term interest rates in the United States were this low was during the middle and late 1930s, as the U.S. economy struggled to emerge from the Great Depression. Policy rates in other countries are also at historically low levels. Nominal rates in Japan, Switzerland, Denmark, and Sweden are actually negative, as are government bond yields in Germany and Japan, even at maturities over five years.[10] Real government bond yields—returns after inflation—are at or below zero across a wide swath of countries, including the United States.\n\nReal and nominal yields at these low levels raise concerns for the economic outlook and for monetary policy. Low real returns challenge those trying to accumulate assets for retirement or those who rely on income from their investments. Low nominal yields can be a sign that monetary policy is struggling to maintain long-run price stability—or they can be a sign that central banks are pursuing highly accommodative policies. High levels of accommodation have the potential to distort asset-allocation decisions and the hiring and investment decisions made by businesses. The stakes are high: History has shown that real and financial market imbalances, once they accumulate, typically are painful to unwind. The difficulty is that these imbalances often aren’t obvious until after the fact.\n\nWhy are short-term interest rates so low? What can be done to stimulate growth and create an environment that is conducive to normalizing the level of interest rates in the United States? What should be the role of monetary policy, as well as other government actions, in this effort?\n\nTo address these questions, let me start with a discussion of the neutral real interest rate.\n\nAs central bankers, we aim for monetary policy to be accommodative when the economy is operating below full employment and trend inflation is below target. We typically begin to remove accommodation as we move closer to achieving those dual goals. When our full-employment and price-stability goals are in conflict, the FOMC makes an assessment of the “balance of risks” to the two objectives.\n\nWhile there are disagreements about how much slack remains in the labor market and about how best to gauge trend inflation, policy debates focus more fundamentally on how to gauge the appropriate level of tightness or easiness in monetary policy. This, in turn, depends on judgments about the “neutral rate”—the rate that signifies the dividing line between an accommodative and a restrictive monetary policy. This debate is complicated by the fact that the neutral rate is “unobserved”—that is, we infer this rate based on observations of financial and economic data.\n\nIn January 2012, Federal Reserve policy makers submitted their projections of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate over the medium term. Since that date, the median projection of these policymakers has declined from a 4.25 percent longer-run nominal funds rate to 3.0 percent in the most recent June submission. Given the FOMC’s commitment to a 2.0 percent longer-run inflation target, these projections imply a reduction in the longer-run neutral real interest rate from 2.25 percent to 1.0 percent today. Trading levels of Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) have signaled a substantially similar decline in the longer-run neutral real rate.[11]\n\nA major driver of the decline in the neutral rate is a decrease in estimates of future growth. In the first quarter of 2003, the Congressional Budget Office projected five-year prospective growth would average 3.25[12] percent per year; in the first quarter of 2008, the prospective five-year growth estimate was 2.88[13] percent per year, and today, prospective five-year growth is estimated to be 2.28[14] percent per year.\n\nThis growth slowdown has been mostly due to demographics—baby boomers are moving into their retirement years—but weaker productivity growth also contributes significantly to this decline. Given the deterioration in U.S. growth prospects, it makes sense that the longer-run neutral real interest rate has declined. This deterioration appears to be occurring across all advanced economies, which helps explain the historically low level of rates we are seeing.\n\nAnother likely reason for the decline in the neutral rate is the emergence of the U.S. as chief supplier of safe assets to the world. In an increasingly globally connected world, the search for safety and return occurs globally—meaning that low rates in one country can quickly impact interest rates in other countries. Robert Hall of Stanford University and the Hoover Institution argues that the representation of risk-averse foreign investors in U.S. financial markets has increased and that this trend has contributed to downward pressure on the neutral real rate.[15]\n\nMy colleague John Williams, president of the San Francisco Fed, along with Thomas Laubach, on the staff of the Board of Governors, has done pioneering work on the neutral rate (r*) that argues the longer-run neutral real rate depends on the economy’s potential growth rate, which varies over time, as well as other unobserved factors.[16] As of the first quarter of 2016, the Laubach–Williams model implied a 0.2 percent neutral real rate.\n\nEvan Koenig and Alan Armen at the Dallas Fed use movements in slack to help identify the neutral real rate. They focus on shorter-run r* and, rather than make r* a direct function of growth in potential output, Koenig and Armen draw on signals from the financial markets and changes in household wealth. They argue that wealth growth and long-term yields do a good job of picking up changes in growth prospects and capture movements in other r* determinants.[17]\n\nThe Koenig–Armen model says that the short-run neutral real rate was negative 1.3 percent in the first quarter of 2016, about 1.5 percentage points below the latest Laubach–Williams estimate of the longer-run rate and only 15 basis points above the actual real rate. Policy was only modestly accommodative last quarter, according to Koenig–Armen.\n\nWhile these approaches yield different estimates of the neutral real rate, they each indicate that there has been a significant decline over the past several years.\n\nI am strongly persuaded by arguments that aging demographics in advanced economies, a decline in productivity growth and the continued emergence of the U.S. as a source of safe assets have all contributed to the decline in the neutral rate. I also believe that high levels of debt to GDP in advanced economies and higher levels of political polarization have, at a minimum, limited the capacity of these countries to use fiscal policy and structural reforms that could have stimulated higher rates of growth. This situation has, in turn, caused the neutral rate to be lower than it would be otherwise.\n\nIn light of the decline in the neutral rate, using monetary policy to help manage the economy has become more challenging. One of the implications of very low short-term rates is that there is less room for monetary policy makers to use these rates to increase the level of accommodation in situations where it is deemed advisable. This has led central banks around the world to try other, more “unconventional” policies to create greater accommodation. Examples include quantitative easing in various forms as well as negative interest rates.\n\nMonetary policy has a key role to play in economic policy. However, at or near the zero lower bound, it may be less effective than other tools of economic policy. Monetary policy is not designed, by itself, to address the key structural issues we face today stemming from demographic changes, lower levels of productivity growth and high levels of debt to GDP as well as dislocations created by globalization and increasing rates of economic disruption. While monetary policy certainly has a key role to play, it is not a substitute for actions that address structural issues and other economic challenges.\n\nFor the past eight years, advanced economies have relied heavily on monetary policy and much less on fiscal policy as well as other structural reforms. However, at this stage, if we are going to generate higher sustainable rates of GDP growth and address key secular issues, there needs to be policy action beyond monetary policy. This action could take a variety of forms.\n\nGiven that aging of the population is expected to continue to create headwinds for future economic growth, more could be done to examine policies that could ensure an inflow of workers to strengthen and grow the U.S. workforce. Appropriate immigration policy is a key element of this effort.\n\nInvestment in education is also a key element of ensuring that our population achieves sufficiently high levels of educational attainment so they can become productive members of the labor force. Many have argued that improving educational attainment is critical to raising workforce productivity in the U.S., thereby improving economic growth. Options for improving educational attainment must include beefing up public/private partnerships that focus on vocational training that equips workers for technical and other skills-based opportunities of the 21st century.\n\nPublic investments that upgrade aging infrastructure could potentially improve productivity and help to bolster sluggish demand. Given the sizable private pools of capital that exist today, some meaningful portion of this investment could come from public/private partnerships, with substantial capital coming from the private sector.\n\nMore broadly, tax reform and regulatory policies that create incentives for growth and investment could ultimately improve growth rates. Improved growth expectations could help to counter the forces holding down the neutral real interest rate, giving monetary policy makers greater scope for action without resorting to unconventional tools.\n\nSome observers suggest conducting a comprehensive review of regulations at the national, state and local levels. They argue that, in some cases, excessive regulation and fees might be creating undue burdens on capital investment, lending, and the formation and growth of small business. This may help to explain why business investment and small-business formation have been disappointing over the past several years.\n\nAccording to government estimates, the present value of future underfunding of “entitlements” is in excess of $45 trillion.[18] This underfunding is expected to increase annual U.S. budget deficits, as a percent of GDP, into the foreseeable future. Some have suggested that this level of underfunding may create growth in federal debt burdens that is unsustainable.\n\nEntitlement reforms, which involve strengthening these programs without jeopardizing potential benefits for those already 55 or older, could help improve the sustainability as well as ease the future fiscal burden of these programs. In addition, reforms might reduce current disincentives to remain in the labor force, while helping to soften the demographic transition’s depressing effects on growth and interest rates. Such reforms, insofar as they ease long-term concerns regarding the sustainability of debt to GDP, might also reduce uncertainty about future tax rates and boost growth expectations through that channel.\n\nHistorically during economic downturns, fiscal policy has often been used to assist monetary policy. However, due to high levels of debt to GDP as well as political polarization, governments have had difficulty coming to consensus on such action.[19]\n\nThese are some examples of policy actions which could be considered. There are certainly other examples, including efforts to implement more comprehensive trade policy. Policy makers would need to address which of these might make sense to pursue. Whichever choices policy makers prefer, my point is that some of these actions will be necessary to address the challenges we currently face.\n\nI am optimistic about the strength of the U.S. economy and the future of this nation. However, this optimism is based on a belief that we as a nation will address pressing secular as well as shorter-term cyclical challenges. Our ability to face key issues and come together to address them has been an essential element of the enduring strength and success of our great country.\n\nI believe our country is at the stage where structural reforms, fiscal policy and other government actions need to join the menu of economic policy. That is, to address several of the key challenges we face, there needs to be economic policy action beyond monetary policy. While there may be good reasons why monetary policy has been the primary policy action over the past several years, we are now at the point where policy makers must enter a new phase in our thinking and actions.\n\nWe need to think more expansively about how to generate higher rates of GDP growth. Now, eight years after the Great Recession, we need to take a new and broader approach to our economic policy making.\n\nThank you. I look forward to taking your questions.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "April 29, 2016 Dallas\n\nI want to thank the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum for inviting me here today. I have worked extensively with British and European companies over the past 25 years, so I am very pleased to be able to talk with you today.\n\nI have been president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas since the beginning of September. The Dallas Fed has approximately 1,200 employees and oversees the Eleventh District, which is comprised of Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico.\n\nAs you know, the Federal Reserve is the central bank of the United States. It was legally established by Congress in 1913 and is charged with the mission of ensuring the stability and flexibility of the nation’s monetary and financial systems. It is responsible for monetary policy, regulation and supervision of banking institutions, and providing certain financial services to banks and the U.S. federal government (which includes playing a key role in the nation’s payment system). It is comprised of a Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., as well as 12 regional banks distributed across the United States. Each region is numbered and referred to as a “district.”\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is the key monetary policymaking body within the Federal Reserve System. It holds eight scheduled meetings a year to assess economic conditions in the U.S. and decide on the stance of monetary policy. FOMC participants include all members of the Board of Governors as well as the 12 regional Bank presidents. The governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and a rotating group of four other regional Bank presidents vote on policy at each FOMC meeting.\n\nThe Fed has been structured to be independent within the federal government, and the chair of the Board of Governors provides regular reports to Congress on the economy and monetary policy. Most central banks globally have been set up in a similar manner, with independence (that is, insulation from short-term political pressure) as a key feature of their operating models.\n\nSince joining the Fed, I have participated in six FOMC meetings. I have also spent a substantial amount of time getting to know business and community leaders throughout the Eleventh District and developed good working relationships with the other Federal Reserve Bank presidents and the Board of Governors.\n\nI have so far been very impressed with the dedication and commitment to excellence of my Fed colleagues in the Eleventh District and across the nation. I have also learned that the Fed benefits greatly from a diversity of views and a process which seeks out insight from members of the private sector, community leaders and other citizens. I have been impressed with the substantial amount of time volunteered by business leaders and nonprofit leaders in monthly board meetings, economic surveys and one-on-one meetings which inform and supplement our analysis of economic conditions.\n\nToday, I’d like to speak with you about my assessment of economic conditions as well as my views regarding monetary policy. I’d like to start my remarks with a brief discussion of some of the larger secular issues that I see forming the broader context for our work.\n\nThe Broader Context\n\nI came to the Fed because I believe that, as challenging as the past eight years have been, the next period of time is likely to be just as complex. While the U.S. and the world have made good progress in recovering from the economic crisis, we still face a number of significant challenges. Many of these issues arise from longer-term secular forces that have been taking shape over the past several years and are likely to exert even greater influence in the future.\n\nGlobalization\nThe world has become much more interconnected over the past several decades. Major companies have become more global and have increasingly spread their operations throughout the world in order to serve customers and improve their competiveness. This geographic expansion has improved flexibility in sourcing and producing in order to manage logistics and lower costs.\n\nCompanies increasingly think about their labor, products and services with a global mindset. By and large, corporate revenue and profit growth have been enhanced by globalization even though this trend has clearly created strains on cities and towns which have seen jobs and industries relocate to other geographic regions. As evidence of this trend, S&P 500 companies now derive as much as 50 percent of their earnings from operations outside the United States.[1]\n\nAs global trade between countries has expanded, economic conditions in one nation now have a greater potential to impact economic conditions in other nations. These impacts are generally transmitted through the trade of goods and services as well as through impacts on labor market dynamics.\n\nWhile economies are more globally connected, financial markets have also become much more interconnected. Investment portfolios are increasingly global, and asset allocators increasingly think globally in making investment decisions. Because financial markets trade in real time, market strains or other challenges in one market now have the potential to rapidly affect currency, debt and equity markets globally.\n\nWe certainly saw the effects of this interconnectedness during the financial crisis of 2008–09. More recently, and on a much smaller scale, we saw how turmoil in currencies and local markets in certain countries in early 2016 helped lead to global market volatility and a rapid tightening of overall financial conditions.\n\nDemographics\nA second major challenge is demographics. The United States and other major economies, including Europe, Japan and China, are all facing the issue of aging populations. For example, in the U.S. as the baby-boomer generation moves into retirement age, the fraction of the labor force age 55 or older is projected to increase from approximately 21.7 percent in 2014 to almost 25 percent in 2024.[2] Looking further ahead, the median age of the labor force is expected to rise steadily through 2060.\n\nIn the Euro area, we estimate that the working-age population, as a percentage of the total population, has been declining since 1990. Further, we estimate that the absolute size of the working-age population likely peaked in 2010 at approximately 219 million and has since declined in absolute terms and will continue to decline in the coming decades.[3] In the United Kingdom, we expect the working-age population will continue to grow, although at a somewhat slower pace than growth in the total population.\n\nThese demographic trends bear directly on the rates of workforce participation and, in turn, impact rates of potential economic growth in advanced economies. For example, based on current demographic trends, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that the labor participation rate in the U.S. will decline 2 percentage points to approximately 61 percent by 2024.[4] Assuming no mitigating actions are taken, this will likely have some negative impact on potential GDP (gross domestic product) growth rates in the future.\n\nHigh Levels of Debt to GDP\nWhile these demographic trends continue to unfold, it is also the case that levels of debt to GDP have increased in advanced economies. In the U.S., for example, household balance sheets have improved since the crisis but business debt to GDP is somewhat higher and government debt to GDP has also increased.\n\nWhile the U.S. government debt held by the public is approximately 75 percent of GDP,[5] it is estimated that the present value of underfunded “entitlements” is now in excess of $40 trillion.[6] These underfunded obligations will increasingly work their way into the annual budget deficit over the next five to 10 years and will help to increase the U.S. budget deficit as a percentage of GDP.\n\nThe demographic trends I just described are likely to put increasing strains on the ability of advanced economies to meet these growing obligations. In light of these demographics, there is some question as to whether these U.S. budget trends will prove to be unsustainable and whether similar strains will be felt in Japan, China and the U.K. as well as most major countries in Europe.\n\nIn addition, the rising future burden of entitlements, coupled with a higher degree of political polarization in certain countries, has likely impaired the capacity for fiscal policy actions, which could have potentially contributed to economic recoveries around the world. This, in turn, has put substantial focus on the role of monetary policy to address important economic challenges. While monetary policy has a key role to play in this regard, it was never designed nor intended to act in isolation; fiscal policy as well as other governmental actions must also play key roles.\n\nIncreasing Rates of Disruption\n\nWhile these larger forces are unfolding, the rate of disruption in industry is increasing. Consumers increasingly are able to use technology to rapidly compare prices for goods and services. New business models are emerging which offer products and services in a superior manner to older models. Amazon versus a retail store is a classic example.\n\nThese trends are encouraging companies to look for new ways to use technology to lower costs, improve productivity and enhance customer service. While the impacts can be hard to measure, I believe these changes are reducing the pricing power of companies and putting some degree of downward pressure on the prices of many types of goods and services. This, in turn, is affecting the way companies think about traditional capital spending and overall resource allocation.\n\nIt is difficult to fully determine the ultimate impacts of these secular trends on economic growth, labor market dynamics and price stability. However, I do believe that these underlying forces are likely to have a significant impact on economic conditions in the years ahead. These forces will also have significant implications for monetary as well as fiscal policy. As the world has become more complex, central bankers must work to better understand these issues in order to make sound judgments regarding monetary policy.\n\nWith this backdrop, let me turn to a discussion of economic conditions in the Eleventh District, the United States and the world. I will then briefly discuss the implications of these conditions for U.S. monetary policy.\n\nEleventh District Discussion of Energy\n\nI’ll start with a discussion of energy because of its impact on the Eleventh District as well as its importance to the nation and the world.\n\nAs we sit here today, Dallas Fed economists estimate that global daily oil production exceeds daily consumption by more than 1 million barrels per day.[7] It is our current expectation that global oil supply and demand will get into some degree of daily balance by early 2017. This current estimate assumes that non-OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) production will decline significantly during the latter half of this year. This estimate is also underpinned by our forecast that global demand will grow by approximately 1.2 million barrels per day in 2016.[8] Lastly, this forecast assumes that supply disruptions, such as those that have occurred in Nigeria, Iraq and Kuwait, are ultimately resolved, with production being restored.\n\nIt is worth noting that, despite very significant cuts in capital spending in the U.S., supply reductions have been slow to materialize over the past year. When supply reductions have occurred in non-OPEC nations, they have been more than offset by production increases from Iran, Russia and other nations.\n\nAs a result of this recent prolonged period of oversupply, excess inventories in the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) member countries now stand at approximately 440 million barrels.[9] This is a record level of excess inventory and has raised concerns about whether there is sufficient storage capacity in certain geographic areas.\n\nWe believe that market participants have taken some comfort—potentially too much comfort—from discussions of a potential production freeze by OPEC members as well as Russia. We have consistently believed that any such negotiations would be unlikely to lead to actual production declines, and that Iran intends to increase its production until its output reaches pre-sanction levels.\n\nWith these various crosscurrents, we expect 2016 to be a year of continued price volatility as production estimates continue to fluctuate and forecasts regarding the timing of supply/demand balance continue to be adjusted. We also expect to see a continuing high level of restructurings, bankruptcies and (where possible) mergers in the energy industry.\n\nEleventh District Overall Economic Conditions\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the Eleventh District of the Federal Reserve is comprised of Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico. While energy is an important part of this region, its share of GDP has declined over the past two years. In particular, the energy industry is now approximately 2 percent of Texas employment[10] and 9 percent of GDP[11] (versus 3 percent of employment and 14 percent of GDP in 2014).\n\nTexas has substantially diversified its economy over the past 25 years. Some of this diversification has occurred organically, and a significant portion has developed as a result of a sustained migration of people and firms to the state. Since 2000, population growth in Texas has exceeded that of the nation by a full 1 percentage point a year. This growth and diversification have helped contribute to the resiliency of the state despite headwinds from energy as well as a strong dollar.\n\nIn 2016, Dallas Fed economists expect job growth between 0.5 and 1 percent, as compared with 1.3 percent in 2015 and 3.7 percent in 2014.[12] Manufacturing remains weak, but the state’s service sector continues to show steady growth. Risks to our forecast are to the downside as depressed conditions in the energy sector continue to ripple through the Texas economy.\n\nAs a result of a more highly diversified economy as well as the continued migration of people and firms to Texas, I am very optimistic about the growth prospects for Texas and the Eleventh District in the years ahead—particularly as the negative impacts of declining oil prices begin to dissipate.\n\nEconomic Conditions in the U.S. Economy\n\nEstimates of first-quarter GDP growth in the U.S. have been disappointing. Based on a strong consumer, our economists at the Dallas Fed expect that GDP growth will improve over the remainder of this year—and we now forecast growth of approximately 2 percent in 2016. This is sluggish growth by historical standards but should be sufficient to continue to drive down the unemployment rate below the current 5 percent reading.\n\nIn addition to the headline unemployment rate, we also closely watch the labor participation rate, which now stands at approximately 63 percent.[13] While the participation rate is lower than the 66 percent reading in 2007, Dallas Fed economists believe that more than half of the decline is due to aging of the population. We also track estimates of the number of part-time workers who might convert to full time in a stronger job market. Both of these measures have shown signs of improvement in recent months.\n\nIt is my own view that labor market slack needs to be viewed in a global context. That is, excess capacity outside the United States may impact the level of labor slack within the U.S. as companies increasingly think globally about their workforce configuration and deployment. As a result, I believe that we may be able to achieve levels of unemployment that are lower than we have been historically accustomed, without creating near-term inflation pressures.\n\nIn terms of inflation, our economists look at headline levels but also look closely at the Dallas Fed’s Trimmed Mean PCE (personal consumption expenditures) measure of core inflation. This measure trims out those items with the most extreme upward and downward monthly price movements. While the headline measure of inflation has been running well below our 2 percent objective, the 12-month change in the trimmed mean ranged consistently between 1.6 and 1.7 percent from early 2014 until the end of 2015. This measure has ticked up to between 1.8 and 1.9 percent in 2016.[14] These readings give us confidence that headline inflation will ultimately increase toward our 2 percent objective over the medium term.\n\nGlobal Economic Conditions\n\nOur economists at the Dallas Fed closely monitor economic conditions outside the U.S. because, in a globally connected world, these conditions have the potential to impact the U.S. economy.\n\n2016 estimates of growth outside the U.S. continue to decline. The underlying composition of these growth estimates is highly uneven. In particular, commodity-sensitive countries such as Venezuela, Brazil and Russia are in recession, while most advanced economies show steady but moderate rates of growth.\n\nAs mentioned in my opening comments, most advanced economies are challenged by aging-demographic trends as well as high levels of debt relative to GDP. In my view, both these trends create headwinds for current and future economic growth. These issues are particularly acute in Japan, where the population is declining and its dependency ratio—the ratio of those age 14 and under plus those 65 and over relative to those 15–64—has been rising since the early 1990s.[15] Similar dynamics, although less severe, are also unfolding in Europe.\n\nIn addition, we are closely watching China, given its size and importance to world GDP growth. China grew at a reported rate of 6.9 percent in 2015.[16] We estimate that this growth rate will slow to 6.5 percent in 2016 and likely trend lower in subsequent years.[17] China is dealing with high levels of overcapacity (particularly in state-owned enterprises), high levels of debt and an aging workforce. In addition, it has embarked on a longer-term transition from being an export- and investment-driven economy to one that is dominated by services and the consumer. This is likely to be a very difficult transition, which will play out over many years as opposed to quarters. Given these various challenges, we believe that the world is going to need to adjust to lower levels of Chinese growth in the years ahead.\n\nChina’s challenges are likely to have some spillover effects on emerging-market countries as well as the U.S. and other advanced economies. Possibly more significantly, China’s challenges have the potential to transmit to financial markets through heightened currency volatility as well as periodic bouts of tightening in global financial conditions.\n\nImplications for Monetary Policy\n\nAs you know, the Fed has a mandate to pursue full employment and price stability. Regarding our full-employment objective, I believe we are making good progress toward reaching our goal.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I believe that, in a more interconnected world, labor slack should be assessed in a global context. Excess capacity outside the U.S. may dampen inflation pressures in the U.S. at a given level of unemployment. I am encouraged by the recent uptick in the labor participation rate to 63 percent. I think it suggests that we can make even further progress on so-called discouraged workers reentering the labor force. As a result, we may still have capacity for healthy job growth without overheating the economy or unduly stressing the capacity of the U.S. workforce.\n\nIn terms of price stability, headline inflation continues to run below our 2 percent objective. However, I believe that, as the impacts of lower energy prices and a strong dollar ultimately dissipate, headline inflation will gradually trend toward our core inflation readings. As mentioned earlier, the Trimmed Mean PCE now stands at between 1.8 and 1.9 percent, and we expect this measure to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as we move toward full employment.\n\nI am monitoring how slowing growth, high levels of overcapacity, and high levels of debt to GDP in advanced economies outside the U.S. impact economic conditions in the U.S. I am also closely monitoring how these issues might be affecting the slope of the U.S. Treasury yield curve as well as measures of tightness in financial conditions.\n\nIn light of these challenges, I have been suggesting that removal of accommodation should be done gradually and patiently. I am also very cognizant that, from a risk-management point of view, our monetary policies have an asymmetrical impact at or near the zero lower bound.\n\nHowever, I do believe that the effort to “normalize” monetary policy is important and that excessive accommodation has a cost in terms of creating distortions in investing, hiring and other decisions which can create unhealthy imbalances. These imbalances are often easier to recognize in hindsight and can be very painful to address.\n\nAs a result, as we continue to make progress in achieving our dual mandate, I will advocate that we take actions to remove some amount of accommodation. However, I will also advocate that we take these steps in a gradual and patient manner.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak with you today. Now, I would be very happy to take your questions.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "March 3, 2016 Dallas\n\nThank you for having me here today. I appreciate the opportunity to talk with you.\n\nA little background: I have been president of the Dallas Fed since early September of 2015. Since that time, I have had the opportunity to meet with and get to know business and community leaders and talk with many other people throughout this district (which includes Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico). I have attended four Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings and developed good working relationships with the other Federal Reserve Bank presidents as well as with the Board of Governors.\n\nI’ve been impressed with the quality of the people at the Fed and their unwavering commitment to serve the citizens of the nation. I have seen a high level of rigor, intensity and overall excellence in the Fed’s work on monetary policy and supervision, as well as in the various other important functions it performs on behalf of the American people.\n\nSince taking this role, I have developed a much greater appreciation for the complexity of the Fed’s work in analyzing economic conditions and making decisions regarding monetary policy. I have learned that, in a rapidly changing world, there are seldom “no brainer” or easy decisions. This work requires an open mind, intellectual diligence and persistence, a willingness to work through complexity, and a desire to understand arguments and counterarguments. And yes, when appropriate, you have got to be able to change your mind and make balanced judgments in order to serve the nation.\n\nOne key aspect of the Fed is the vital role played by members of the private sector as well as community leaders in our work. On the Dallas Fed boards of directors, which include our branch boards in Houston, San Antonio and El Paso, we have business, community and nonprofit leaders with diverse geographic, cultural and functional backgrounds. They spend a substantial amount of time with us sharing valuable insights regarding economic trends and overall economic conditions.\n\nIn addition, hundreds of private sector businesses in our district regularly participate in our manufacturing, service sector, agricultural, energy and Beige Book surveys.[1] These surveys are an essential information source regarding conditions in our region. In addition to these activities, before every FOMC meeting, I speak with numerous industry leaders to discuss their insights regarding economic conditions in the district, the nation and the rest of the world. Our economic research and policy work is dramatically enhanced by the enormous contribution of time from this diverse group of leaders. Their contributions are essential to our ability to make sound decisions for the country.\n\nWith that background, let me make a few comments on economic conditions in the district, the nation and the world. I will then comment on implications of these conditions for monetary policy.\n\nThe Eleventh District: Discussion of Energy\n\nIt is our view at the Dallas Fed that, in 2016, global energy production will exceed consumption by an average of approximately 1 million barrels per day.[2] By year-end, we believe that this excess will decline to approximately 500,000 barrels per day.[3] We expect that global demand will grow by approximately 1.2 million barrels per day in 2016.[4]\n\nOECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) inventories continue to increase and now stand at roughly 400 million barrels above the historical five-year average.[5] These excess inventory levels will increase through 2016, and there is now some discussion in the industry about potential limits in storage capacity.\n\nWe estimate that the market will not find some degree of daily production/consumption balance until mid-2017 and, at that point, excess inventories will begin to decline. This forecast has been influenced over the past several months by the official return of Iran to the world oil markets, increased supply from OPEC nations, slower-than-expected supply declines from U.S. producers despite substantial cuts in drilling and capital spending, and slower-than-expected demand from emerging-market countries. This outlook would be meaningfully impacted by a change in OPEC production strategy.\n\nGiven these various factors, the ultimate timing of market production/consumption balance remains uncertain. In the meantime, we expect to see continued low prices and high levels of price volatility, as well as more bankruptcies, mergers and restructurings in the energy industry.\n\nOne by-product of lower oil prices is wider credit spreads in the high-yield market. Because corporate energy issuers comprise a material portion of high-yield issuance, and because high-yield debt is heavily held in mutual-fund (with daily liquidity obligations) and exchange-traded fund form, weakness in the energy sector has the potential to create increased levels of fund redemptions. This, in turn, can put pressure on funds to sell holdings more broadly in order to meet liquidity needs. This is a good example of the potential negative ripple effects that can come from persistent weakness in the energy sector.\n\nBroad Economic Conditions in the Eleventh District\n\nAs has been the case for the past year, the Eleventh District is being adversely affected by low oil prices as well as the strength of the dollar. As a result of these challenges, Texas job growth slowed from 3.6 percent in 2014 to 1.5 percent in 2015, and Dallas Fed economists expect only about 1 percent growth in 2016.[6] Risks to this forecast are to the downside if oil stays at or below $30 per barrel for an extended period.\n\nWhile the nation’s unemployment rate has declined since the beginning of 2015, the Texas unemployment rate increased from 4.4 percent at the beginning of the year to 4.6 percent at year-end.[7] We expect the state unemployment rate to rise further in 2016 even as the national unemployment rate continues to fall.\n\nIn 2015, the Texas energy and manufacturing sectors lost jobs while the state’s service sector showed steady, moderate growth.[8] This recent economic performance has been bolstered by the diversified nature of the Texas economy. While Houston’s growth has been brought to a halt by the energy downturn, Austin, Dallas and San Antonio have shown strong growth and continue to attract people and firms from around the country and the world.\n\nThe energy industry accounted for approximately 2 percent of Texas employment[9] and approximately 10 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2015,[10] a good deal lower than in the 1980s, when that oil bust pushed the Texas economy into a major recession. While the downturn in the energy industry has created negative ripple effects in the state, the Texas economy has proven to be highly resilient. I expect this resiliency and underlying strength to continue as the negative impacts of energy begin to dissipate in the years ahead.\n\nEconomic Conditions in the Nation\n\nGross Domestic Product and Unemployment\nThe Commerce Department estimates that the U.S. economy grew 1.9 percent in 2015, and our economists expect a similar rate of growth in 2016.[11] This rate of GDP growth, while sluggish by historical standards, was sufficient to drive down the U.S. unemployment rate from 5.6 percent at the start of the year to approximately 5 percent by year-end, and to 4.9 percent in January.[12]\n\nThe service sector continues to be the primary driver of growth in the U.S. economy. In contrast, the manufacturing sector continues to struggle as a result of a strong dollar and continued weakness outside the U.S.\n\nOur economists expect the unemployment rate to continue to decline in 2016, but at a slower pace. In addition to looking at the headline rate, we also track other measures that gauge the degree of slack in the labor market. In particular, we closely monitor the labor force participation rate, which is the share of the population that is either employed or actively looking for work. This share is currently 62.7 percent, which is approximately 3.5 percentage points below its prerecession level.[13] Our Dallas Fed economists believe that over one-half of this decline is explained by aging-workforce demographics. We are also tracking measures of “discouraged” workers, who have given up looking for work, as well as estimates of the number of part-time workers who might convert to full time in a stronger job market.\n\nMy own view is that overcapacity in non-U.S. economies must be considered along with domestic labor slack in assessing the implications of a given U.S. unemployment rate. In an increasingly globalized world, U.S. companies assess their employment decisions in a global context. As a result, I believe that the headline rate which constitutes “full employment” will likely be lower than the level to which we have historically been accustomed.\n\nInflation\nHeadline inflation readings continue to run below the 2 percent long-run objective set by the FOMC. A stronger dollar and lower oil prices are two key factors that are negatively impacting the rate of inflation.\n\nAt the Dallas Fed, we attempt to look past more transitory factors by focusing on the Trimmed Mean PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation rate, which excludes those items with the most extreme upward and downward monthly price movements. Since early 2014, the 12-month change in the trimmed mean ran between 1.6 and 1.7 percent. In January 2016, the 12-month rate ticked up to approximately 1.9 percent. The stability and trend of this measure are important to track as we consider inflation prospects over the medium term.\n\nI will be closely watching these measures as well as the impact of anticipated further reductions in labor market slack in assessing the Fed’s progress toward meeting its 2 percent objective. I will also be monitoring the impact of key secular trends discussed later in this speech.\n\nWorld Economic Conditions\n\n\n\nOur economists at the Dallas Fed have lowered their expectations for growth outside the U.S. In 2016, we expect global growth, excluding the U.S., to be approximately 2.7 percent. This includes negative growth in commodity-exposed countries such as Brazil, Russia and Venezuela as well as 7.4 percent GDP growth in India.[14] This estimate of the non-U.S. growth rate comes with a high level of downside risk.\n\nOne particular concern is China, which is trying to manage high levels of industrial overcapacity, high levels of leverage, aging demographics, and decreasing levels of reserves (which they have used to manage their currency devaluations). China is also working to manage a longer-term transition from a manufacturing and export-driven economy to one that is more consumer and service-sector based.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund forecasts that China’s growth rate will slow to approximately 6.3 percent in 2016 from 6.9 percent in 2015. Whatever the actual number, it seems clear that the world will have to adjust to lower rates of Chinese growth in the years ahead. China’s economic challenges have the potential to create negative spillovers that impact economic conditions in the U.S. as well as other economies.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nAs a businessperson, I am regularly reminded that it is important to be open to learning from and adapting to changing circumstances. It is important to avoid being rigid, closed minded, or ideological in my thinking. Asking the right questions is more important than having all the answers. With that preamble, let me discuss my views regarding monetary policy.\n\nFrom January 1 through March 1 this year, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of stocks declined approximately 3.2 percent.[15] Global stock markets (excluding the U.S.) declined approximately 6 percent.[16] The 10-year Treasury rate declined from 2.27 percent to 1.82 percent.[17] The price of oil declined from $37.13 per barrel to $34.39.[18] The U.S. dollar exchange rate versus the yen moved from 120.38 yen/dollar to 113.17.[19] In that period, China devalued its currency. Investment-grade and high-yield credit spreads widened.\n\nSuffice it to say that global financial conditions have tightened. This tightening is likely to have had a restraining impact on the underlying pace of economic activity akin to some level of increase in the fed funds rate.\n\nOne obvious question is the extent to which a decline in the S&P is reflective of meaningfully weaker economic conditions in the U.S. In assessing this question, it is worth noting that the S&P is not the same as the U.S. economy. In particular, S&P 500 firms derive about 38 percent of their revenue[20] and as much as 50 percent[21] of their earnings from outside the U.S., while only about 11 percent of U.S. GDP is derived from exports.[22] The S&P decline may suggest weaker expectations among market participants for corporate earnings due to slowing global growth and wider credit spreads as well as a stronger dollar. It may also reflect some level of normal and healthy market revaluation.\n\nOn the positive side, lower oil prices and a stronger dollar should benefit the U.S. consumer. Due to a strong consumer, my own expectation is that the U.S. economy will likely be resilient in 2016. Having said that, I believe that recent developments call for patience and further diligence in assessing the impacts of slowing global growth and tighter financial conditions on the U.S. economy.\n\nIn addition, I am also closely monitoring the impact of key secular trends relating to high levels of debt and aging demographics in the United States and other major economies, including Europe, Japan and China. These secular factors could create downward pressure on potential growth rates and, all things being equal, tend to lower the so-called “neutral” rate, the interest rate at which the Fed is neither restrictive nor accommodative.\n\nWhile I believe that excessive accommodation carries a cost in terms of distortions and imbalances in hiring, asset allocation and investment decisions, I also believe that, at this juncture, the Fed needs to show patience in decisions to remove accommodation. Again, this is particularly true in light of key global secular trends as well as recent developments relating to slowing global economic growth and tightening financial conditions.\n\nI believe that the Fed should avoid having a predetermined mindset regarding the path of policy. This path should be driven by our ongoing analyses of cyclical as well as secular trends.\n\nI think it makes sense to emphasize that, at this juncture, monetary policy remains accommodative; although I would note again that policy is somewhat less accommodative than it was on January 1 in light of tightening global financial conditions.\n\nLastly, I would emphasize that monetary policy should serve as an element of overall economic policy. It is not designed to act in isolation or as a substitute for fiscal policy or structural reforms. There are limits to the potential impacts of monetary policy.\n\nThe broad domestic secular challenges of an aging population, access to education and health care, underinvestment in infrastructure, high levels of debt to GDP, and projected stresses on our ability to meet future obligations for retirement and medical benefits are all examples of issues that may affect the long-run path of sustainable economic growth. While monetary policy has a critical role to play in promoting good economic performance and price stability, it has limitations in being able to address these longer-run issues.\n\nNow, I would be very happy to take your questions.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "January 11, 2016 Dallas\n\nThank you for that kind introduction. Thank you for having me here this evening. It’s a great pleasure for me to speak with you.\n\nFor those who I haven’t had a chance to meet yet, I was an investment banker and financial services executive for almost 23 years and then a professor at Harvard Business School for 10 years. I grew up in Kansas, went to the University of Kansas and spent a lot of time as a youngster traveling the state of Texas with my father, who was a jewelry salesman. I have always had a desire to do public service, so I was very glad to have the opportunity to lead the Dallas Fed.\n\nI have been president of the Dallas Fed since the beginning of September. It’s a great honor to be able to serve the people of the Eleventh Federal Reserve District (which includes Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico) and the nation. I have spent the past four months getting to know business and community leaders, as well as talking with many other people throughout this district. I have attended three Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings and developed good working relationships with the other Federal Reserve Bank presidents as well as the Board of Governors.\n\nI have been impressed with the people who live and work in this district and with our dedicated staff at the Dallas Fed, as well as those who work in the Federal Reserve System across the nation. I say regularly that, as a citizen, if you could see what I get to see every day, you would be very proud and gratified by the work of the people of the Federal Reserve.\n\nWith that background, I’d like to speak tonight about the regional, national and global economies and then talk about implications for monetary policy. If there’s a theme, it’s how the world has changed and keeps changing. Our job at the Fed is to work to understand these changes, be continually open to learning and asking questions, and then strive to make good decisions for the citizens of this country.\n\nAs I speak this evening, my remarks represent my own views and do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Eleventh District: Discussion of Energy\n\nI’ll begin my remarks with a discussion of the energy industry, given its vital importance to this district and the nation. Since the December Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) meeting, the overall tone in the oil and gas sector has soured, as expectations have decidedly shifted to an “even lower for even longer” price outlook.\n\nOPEC seems to have abandoned any pretense of production quotas, and Saudi Arabia seems to be determined to maintain its market share of production. As a consequence, it appears that any reduction in supply from Saudi Arabia will have to be accompanied by proportionate declines from other middle-eastern nations and Russia—this, so far, seems unlikely.\n\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) inventories continue to increase and now stand at roughly 300 million barrels above their historical five-year average.[1] For 2015, the Department of Energy estimates that global supply exceeded global demand by an average of 1.7 million barrels per day.[2] As of today, this gap has declined to approximately 1 million barrels per day and is expected to ultimately drop to 600,000 barrels per day by year-end 2016.[3] Our economists at the Dallas Fed believe that global excess inventories aren’t likely to begin falling until 2017. If we are wrong, the risks are that this rebalancing process will take even longer.\n\nThis situation is further complicated by the expectation that Iran sanctions will likely be lifted in early 2016, and Iran will increase its production shortly thereafter. Furthermore, our industry contacts suggest that Iran has 30–40 million barrels of oil in storage which, over time, could be sold into the world markets. The prospect of all or a portion of this supply coming into the market sooner than expected has increased uncertainty and negatively impacted oil prices.\n\nAnother complicating factor is that, despite rig count declines and additional cuts in capital spending, U.S. oil production declines have been slow to materialize. This reflects increased output from the Gulf of Mexico, the time lag between capital spending cuts and production declines, as well as the fact that shale-well productivity has improved over the past several years.\n\nAll this suggests that 2016 will be a challenging year for oil producers. On the positive side, lower oil prices translate into lower gasoline prices for consumers. These lower prices have helped generate stronger automobile driving activity as well as record auto sales in the U.S., and underpin our expectation of a 1.4-million-barrel-per-day increase in global consumption in 2016.[4]\n\nGiven these various cross-currents, the ultimate timing of reaching market production/consumption balance remains uncertain. As a consequence, we expect to see continued low prices and price volatility, as well as more bankruptcies, mergers and restructurings in the energy industry.\n\nBroad Economic Conditions in the Eleventh District\n\nCertainly, the Eleventh District economy has been adversely impacted by low oil prices as well as strength in the dollar. As a result of these challenges, Texas job growth slowed to approximately 1.3 percent in 2015, and Dallas Fed economists expect similar growth in 2016.[5] This compares with the 3.6 percent job growth the state experienced in 2014.[6]\n\nWhile the Texas energy and manufacturing sectors have been losing jobs, the state’s service sector has shown steady, moderate expansion. We have seen particular strength in the health care and the leisure and hospitality industries. We have also seen recent strength in construction employment in the state.\n\nIt is worth noting that migration of firms and people has been a key underpinning of economic growth in this state. Since 2000, the average annual rate of population growth in Texas has been almost a full percentage point higher than the rest of the nation.[7] Despite some slowing due to the downturn in energy, I expect this migration trend to continue albeit at a slower rate. Due to the diversified nature of the state’s economy and continued attractiveness of the state as a destination for firms and people, I am very optimistic about the resiliency and overall economic outlook for this district in the years ahead.\n\nEconomic Conditions in the Nation\n\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) and Employment\nDallas Fed economists estimate that the U.S. economy grew approximately 2 percent in 2015. While this rate of growth is sluggish by historical standards, it was sufficient to drive down the rate of unemployment from 5.6 percent at the beginning of the year to 5.0 percent by year-end.[8] Our economists expect 2016 GDP growth of somewhere between 2.0 and 2.5 percent.\n\nAs with the Eleventh District, the U.S. service sector has been the primary growth engine in the United States. A strong dollar combined with relatively weak growth abroad continues to weigh on U.S. manufacturing and net exports.\n\nIn 2015, nonfarm payroll job growth averaged 221,000 jobs per month. Dallas Fed economists estimate that the economy needs to add somewhere between 100,000 and 150,000 jobs per month in order to keep the unemployment rate roughly constant. We expect sufficient job growth in 2016 to continue to drive down the rate of unemployment.\n\nTo gauge progress toward our full-employment mandate, we closely monitor various measures of labor market slack beyond the headline unemployment rate. In particular, we look at the labor force participation rate, which is the share of the population age 16 and older that is either employed or actively looking for work. This percentage is currently at 62.6 percent, which is 3.5 percentage points lower than its prerecession level.[9] At the Dallas Fed, we assess that while some of this decline is cyclical, more than half is due to aging workforce demographics. (I’ll talk more about this in a few moments.)\n\nWe also closely monitor the number of “would be” workers who are “discouraged” and have given up looking for work, as well as the number of part-time workers who would convert to full time in a stronger job market. Both of these measures have recently shown improvement, which suggests to us that labor slack is declining and we are making progress toward our full-employment objective.\n\nInflation\nHeadline inflation readings continue to run below the 2 percent longer-run objective set by the Federal Reserve. In November, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index was only 0.4 percent higher than a year earlier.[10]\n\nAt the Dallas Fed, our preferred measure of inflation is the Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate, which “trims out” items with the most extreme upward or downward monthly changes. We believe this trimming gives us a measure of trend inflation that is more reliable than so-called “core” inflation, which excludes food and energy prices. The 12-month change in the trimmed mean has run between 1.6 and 1.7 percent since early 2014. The stability of this measure, in combination with anticipated further reductions in labor market slack, gives us confidence that headline PCE inflation will gradually increase to 2 percent by year-end 2017.\n\nWorld Economic Conditions\n\nWe estimate that 2015 global GDP growth, excluding the U.S., was 2.5 percent.[11] This headline growth rate masks a very uneven underlying picture. For example, emerging economies with high levels of exposure to commodities showed significant declines in growth rates. Brazil, Russia and Venezuela were in outright recession during 2015, and we expect negative GDP growth again in these countries in 2016. On the other hand, India’s GDP growth rate was 7.3 percent in 2015 and is expected to increase further in 2016.[12]\n\nLooking ahead to 2016, Dallas Fed economists expect global growth, excluding the U.S., to gradually improve to 2.9 percent. While this reflects improvements in both advanced as well as emerging-market economies, it is relatively sluggish compared with past rates of growth and comes with some meaningful level of downside risk.\n\nOne potential concern is China. The International Monetary Fund forecasts that China growth will slow to approximately 6.3 percent in 2016 versus a reported growth rate of 6.9 percent in 2015.[13] This slowing has been manifested in dramatic swings in the Chinese stock market (which have, in turn, spilled over into global financial markets), as well as in Chinese government actions intended to address some of their key economic challenges.\n\nOvercapacity in key industries (particularly in state-owned enterprises), higher levels of leverage, and aging demographics are key challenges likely to impede growth. These issues are secular and will take years to address. In addition, China has embarked on a longer-term initiative to transition its economy to be more consumer and service-sector based from one that is heavily manufacturing and export based.\n\nAs a result of these factors, it seems probable that the world will have to adjust to lower levels of Chinese growth in the years ahead. Slower Chinese growth has the potential to further impact commodity prices and create headwinds for GDP growth in the U.S. and other economies.\n\nOpenness to Learning in a Changing World\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I grew up in Kansas and went to college in Kansas. As I was starting my professional career, there were a few things that I (and seemingly) everyone else knew to be true:\n\nWe had never heard of the Internet, mobile devices or online news/content providers, which would allow us to get information immediately and would substantially disrupt the traditional newspaper industry. Japan suffered through decades of slow growth and increasingly challenging issues with high levels of government debt, a shrinking population and aging demographics. And we know what happened with housing and interest rates.\n\nThe point is, what we know “for sure” is not always correct. The world evolves, and we have to be open-minded and adapt to the changes. We have to be willing to learn and, when the facts warrant, modify our views. This way of thinking is particularly important to me as a participant in the monetary policy deliberations of the FOMC.\n\nBecause the world has changed and keeps changing, some of the key tools we use to assess economic conditions must be assessed and reassessed in this context. For example, the Phillips curve has been a critical tool in analyzing the interaction of unemployment rates with inflation. In this current recovery, we are moving toward increasingly low rates of unemployment, but we have not yet seen an increase in headline inflation. Of course, this inflation shortfall may be due to transitory factors, but we are also aware there may be other more fundamental issues at play here.\n\nAdditionally, during this recovery, the labor-force participation rate has remained low by historical standards. As a result, some have questioned whether the headline unemployment rate remains the best measure of labor slack.\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\nI believe there are several key factors that may be impacting economic conditions and should influence the way we think about monetary policy.\n\nDemographic Trends\nThe United States and other major economies, including Europe, Japan and China, are all facing the challenge of aging demographics. For example, in the United States, as the baby-boomer generation moves into retirement age, the fraction of the labor force age 55 or older is projected to increase from approximately 21.7 percent in 2014 to almost 25 percent in 2024.[14] Looking further ahead, the median age of the labor force is expected to rise steadily through 2060.[15]\n\nAging demographics are likely to negatively impact labor force participation rates. As I mentioned earlier, the labor force participation rate in the U.S. has fallen about 3.5 percentage points since late 2007.[16] While the 2008–09 recession certainly had a great impact, we believe that more than half of the decline can be explained by aging. Individuals age 55 and over tend to have lower participation rates than do younger individuals.\n\nBased on current demographic trends, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that the overall labor force participation rate will decline 2 percentage points further to 60.9 percent by 2024.[17] Since GDP growth is substantially impacted by growth in the labor force plus improvements in labor productivity, these trends suggest that, assuming no mitigating actions are taken, potential GDP growth rates may well be negatively impacted in the future.\n\nIn addition, these demographics suggest that the “dependency ratio”—which is crudely measured as the ratio of population under age 18 or over 64 to the population 18–64—will rise. The implication is that an increasing share of the population will “depend” on those of working age to pay for future medical and retirement benefits. This higher dependency ratio may have implications for the ability of countries to meet their obligations for retirement and medical benefits.\n\nOf course, these demographic forecasts are just that—forecasts. Policymakers and other agents have the ability to take actions, and events can occur, which alter or offset these trends, improve productivity or otherwise mitigate their impact. The point is that, as policymakers, we have to be aware of them and be open to adjusting our thinking and our policies in ways that take them into account.\n\nLevels of Debt to GDP\nAnother factor potentially impacting economic conditions is growth in the levels of debt relative to GDP. For much of my lifetime, the household, business and government sectors of the United States have been able to increase their levels of debt relative to overall GDP. This has had the effect, during some periods, of increasing GDP growth rates. Some have referred to this as the so-called “debt super cycle” and suggested that, in the future, additional borrowing will more likely need to be supported by corresponding growth in incomes.\n\nCertainly, since the Great Recession, the household sector in the U.S. has been deleveraging. However, business debt as a share of GDP has grown somewhat (although importantly, the financial sector has deleveraged), and government debt to GDP has also risen. Currently, federal debt held by the public is approximately 73 percent of GDP, up from 33 percent in 2000[18] and, in addition, the present value of future unfunded obligations for Medicare, Social Security and other entitlement programs is estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to be approximately $40 trillion.[19] These unfunded nondiscretionary obligations are expected to cause the U.S. budget deficit to materially increase as a percentage of GDP over the next 10 years and beyond.[20] This path may prove to be unsustainable.\n\nOutside the U.S., high levels of debt to GDP in certain countries are likely to impact these countries’ future ability to grow. China and Japan, for example, may find it difficult to stimulate GDP by growing debt beyond levels supported by income growth.\n\nThe level of borrowing relative to GDP is a key factor I will be watching, in the U.S. and abroad, in assessing economic conditions in the months and years ahead.\n\nGlobalization\nToday, U.S. companies are able to source and produce products and services in multiple countries to lower their costs. Increasingly, U.S. consumers are able to benefit from lower-cost imports as well as lower-cost services due to globalization. Companies increasingly think about their labor, products and services with a global mindset. This greater amount of global connectivity means that economic conditions in each country can much more quickly impact economic conditions in the U.S. and other countries.\n\nOne implication of this is that domestic labor slack has to be assessed in a global context. This means that the headline unemployment rate necessary to achieve full employment can likely be lower for a time than we’ve been historically accustomed to without triggering undue inflation pressures.\n\nThe point is that, as the world becomes even more interconnected and the “transmission” of global economic conditions accelerates, we have to increasingly consider world economic conditions in assessing our own.\n\nIncreasing Rates of Disruption\nConsumers increasingly are able to use technology to rapidly compare prices for goods and services. In addition, new business models are emerging, which offer products and services that “disrupt” older models—think Uber versus a taxi or car service, Airbnb versus a hotel room, Amazon versus a retail store. These new business models are having the impact of lowering prices and improving service and convenience. They are also helping improve the bargaining power of consumers.\n\nThese trends are encouraging many companies to look for new ways to use technology to lower their costs as well as improve productivity and customer service. It may be hard to measure, but I certainly believe these changes are putting some downward pressure on the prices of many types of goods and services.\n\nCertainly, there are various exceptions to this trend such as prescription drugs and affordable luxuries (like a Starbucks coffee). However, increasingly, business models are being disrupted in ways that would not have been imagined only a few years ago. These changes are impacting the way companies think about traditional capital spending and their choices for how to spend additional resources.\n\nIt is difficult to determine the ultimate impacts of aging demographics, high levels of indebtedness, globalization and increasing disruption. However, these are key issues that policymakers will need to better understand in order to assess economic conditions and formulate appropriate economic policies.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nI agree with, and argued for, the decision made in December by the FOMC to increase the federal funds rate. In our post-FOMC meeting statement, we emphasized that, even with this increase, monetary policy remains accommodative. We also emphasized that future removals of accommodation will likely be done gradually and will depend on our ongoing assessment of incoming economic data and overall economic conditions.\n\nAs we go forward, I will be closely monitoring various measures of labor market slack to assess progress toward our full-employment objective. As the unemployment rate moves below 5 percent, I would expect to see the inflation rate gradually increase toward our 2 percent objective in the medium term. Additionally, our economists will be considering how a stronger dollar and more subdued rates of growth outside the U.S. might adversely affect GDP, unemployment and inflation in this country. We’ll also be working to better understand the potential impact of some of the secular issues I have discussed tonight.\n\nI believe that continuing along the path of monetary policy normalization is important. There are various costs to maintaining excessive accommodation for too long—particularly in terms of potential distortions in investment, inventory and hiring decisions, which may need to be (painfully) unwound when policy normalizes. My experience is that these imbalances are sometimes easier to recognize in hindsight.\n\nIn thinking about these questions, we’re sensitive to the fact that monetary policy affects the economy with a lag. As consequence, if we delay further normalization until we actually see evidence of excessive accommodation, there is a risk that we will have waited too long.\n\nIn addition, as we go through this period, I would not be surprised to see more bouts of volatility in the financial markets. The challenge for policymakers is to appropriately consider these movements, without over-reading or misinterpreting them, in assessing underlying economic conditions.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak today. I look forward to getting to know you better in the months and years ahead. Now, I would be very happy to take your questions.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "November 27, 2017\n\nThe target federal funds rate stands in a range of 100 to 125 basis points. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the federal funds rate in March as well as June of this year. I voted for both of these increases. I also supported the FOMC’s decision in September to begin the process of gradually reducing the size of the Federal Reserve balance sheet. I believe that the gradual and phased-in design of this plan should allow the Fed to reduce the size of its Treasury and mortgage-backed securities portfolios without materially impacting either of these important markets.\n\nAs of November 2017, several key labor market indicators suggest that the U.S. economy is at or near full employment. The headline unemployment rate and other measures of labor market utilization are now at or below pre-recession lows. In addition, Dallas Fed economists expect the U.S. economy to continue to grow at rates which should cause labor market conditions to tighten further. While real wage growth has been sluggish, we are beginning to see welcome signs of increasing wage pressures which are consistent with removal of remaining slack from the labor market.\n\nInflation has remained below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target. Moreover, the 12-month Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean PCE, a measure of core inflation (which Dallas Fed economists believe provides a better indicator of underlying inflationary trends than headline readings), started the year at 1.9 percent and has drifted down to 1.6 percent in the latest reading. While some of this recent decline is likely transitory, my view is that some of the more persistent weakness is due to structural forces, which are limiting the pricing power of businesses and are likely having a muting effect on wage pressures for certain types of workers. These structural forces include technology-enabled disruption and, to a lesser extent, globalization (see Appendix A, Technology-Enabled Disruption and Its Implications).\n\nHow should the FOMC address the current situation in which one aspect of our mandate is being met while another objective is not yet being met? In this essay, I intend to address this question.\n\nTo help the public understand its framework for monetary policy, the FOMC released in January 2012, and reaffirmed in January 2017, its “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.”[1] This document articulates the FOMC’s commitment to fulfilling its statutory mandate from Congress of promoting maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates.\n\nIn public discussions, Fed officials typically express this framework as a “dual mandate”—full employment and price stability. The Fed uses a variety of economic and labor market indicators to judge whether the full employment objective is being met. To judge whether the price stability objective is being met, the FOMC has articulated a “symmetric” inflation goal of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE). The term “symmetric” means that the FOMC would be equally concerned if inflation ran either persistently above or persistently below this 2 percent objective.\n\nThese dual-mandate longer-term goals are generally complementary. However, in those cases where they are not, the FOMC has said that it will seek to follow a “balanced approach” in promoting these goals, taking into account the magnitude of the deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate.\n\nAs we sit here today, the headline unemployment rate stands at approximately 4.1 percent. In addition, our Dallas Fed economists also look at the U-6 rate, a broader measure that includes the percent of unemployed, plus the number of discouraged workers, plus people working part time who want to work full time. This measure of labor market utilization now stands at approximately 7.9 percent, matching its prerecession low.\n\nIn addition, we also look closely at the labor force participation rate (the number of employed plus unemployed looking for a job as a percentage of the population 16 and older), which now stands at 62.7 percent. This compares with a participation rate of 66 percent in 2007. Our economists believe that a majority of the decline in participation is due to the aging of the population and, as such, we believe that current participation levels are consistent with an economy that is at or near full employment. Looking ahead, Dallas Fed economists expect this aging trend to continue in the U.S., as well as across almost all advanced economies.\n\nOver the next 10 years, we expect that, due to aging of the workforce, the U.S. participation rate will decline further to 61 percent.[2] This aging trend will likely reduce the rate of labor force growth in the United States. Because GDP growth is comprised of growth in the workforce plus gains in labor productivity, weaker expected workforce growth is likely to negatively affect potential GDP growth in the years ahead—unless steps are taken to mitigate these effects.\n\nThe question arises as to the actual level of maximum sustainable employment, which can be defined as the maximum level of employment that does not generate undue price pressures. Because inflation pressures typically manifest themselves with a lag, this is a judgment that is much easier to make in hindsight than in real time. Having said this, Dallas Fed economists currently believe that we are either at or near the level of maximum sustainable employment, and may well move materially beyond maximum sustainable employment sometime in 2018.\n\nRegarding inflation, we have been notably running behind our 2 percent target for the past several years. My own view has been that, while cyclical inflationary pressures are building, which should become more apparent over time, these pressures are being at least partially offset by the structural headwinds of technology-enabled disruption (see Appendix A) and, to a lesser extent, globalization. Our Dallas Fed economists believe that, as labor market conditions continue to tighten, cyclical inflationary forces should ultimately offset these structural headwinds such that we will likely achieve our 2 percent target in the medium term. We are of course mindful that progress in reaching our inflation mandate may well be slower and more uneven than many analysts currently anticipate.\n\nIn summary, as a policymaker, I am balancing a labor market that is likely to become increasingly overheated in the months ahead with a level of inflation that is running somewhat below our 2 percent goal. While I believe cyclical inflationary forces are building, there is some question regarding how long it will take to reach our price stability objective.\n\nAs a central banker, I want to be vigilant to imbalances and distortions that can build as a result of accommodative monetary policy. I have argued that monetary policy accommodation is not “free” —there are costs to accommodation in the form of distortions and imbalances in consumer decisions as well as in investing, hiring and other business decisions. More specifically, experience suggests that the greater the overshoot of full employment, the more difficult it is to unwind imbalances when growth ultimately slows—as it certainly must.\n\nWhen excesses ultimately need to be unwound, this can result in a sudden downward shift in demand for investment and consumer-related durable goods. There are surprisingly few historical examples of “soft landings” in cases where employment has risen above its maximum sustainable level.\n\nIt is of course possible that “this time will be different,” but as I assess the condition of the U.S. economy, I am carefully monitoring evidence that might suggest growing risks of real imbalances, which could threaten the sustainability of the current economic expansion. For example, the headline unemployment rate has fallen by 70 basis points over the past year, nearly matching the average rate of decline over the prior seven years of the expansion. If this rate of decline continues, this will further tighten labor market conditions and would likely add to excesses and imbalances accumulating in the economy.\n\nExcesses can also manifest themselves in financial imbalances. While I would prefer to rely primarily on macroprudential policy tools to manage financial imbalances, I am nevertheless monitoring various measures of potential financial excess. I monitor these and other market measures because I am aware that, as excesses build, we are more vulnerable to reversals which have the potential to cause a rapid tightening in financial conditions, which in turn, can lead to a slowing in economic activity. Examples of potential excesses might include:\n\nIn the context of managing potential financial imbalances, I believe that we have been well served by strong macroprudential bank regulatory policies which have created tough capital requirements and regular stress testing for large systemically important institutions. These measures have helped guard against excessive debt buildup and creation of other imbalances which often accompany elevated levels of asset valuation.\n\nI strongly favor a prudent review of Dodd–Frank and the Volcker rule, as well as regulatory relief for small- and mid-sized banks. However, I also believe that maintaining strong macroprudential policies for big banks—particularly stringent capital requirements and rigorous annual stress testing—is very important for managing potential financial imbalances at this stage in the economic cycle.\n\nIn assessing progress in reaching our dual mandate, I am increasingly cognizant of the risks posed by potential economic and financial imbalances. Such imbalances, if allowed to build, have the potential to, at some point, threaten the sustainability of the expansion and the attainment of our dual-mandate objectives.\n\nThe FOMC’s stated strategy indicates that when objectives are in conflict—such as appears to be the case today—we are committed to following a “balanced approach” to policy. This approach involves assessing “other” factors, such as the magnitude of deviations from our longer-run inflation goal and deviations of employment from the Committee’s assessment of its maximum level, as well as the timing of expected return to mandated and/or sustainable levels. Put more plainly, even though we are not meeting our inflation objective, the size of the expected full employment overshoot is growing and should be taken into account in assessing appropriate monetary policy actions.\n\nRegarding inflation, I would reiterate that cyclical forces are building, which should increasingly offset the structural forces of technology-enabled disruption and, to a lesser extent, globalization. I am also mindful that if we wait too long to see actual evidence of inflation, we may get behind the curve and have to subsequently raise rates more rapidly. This type of rapid rate rise has the potential to increase the risk of recession.\n\nLastly, due to the structural headwinds of aging demographics and slowing workforce growth in the U.S. as well as most developed economies, I believe that the neutral nominal rate of interest is likely in the neighborhood of 2.5 percent—materially lower than we are historically accustomed. As such, I think it is important that, to the extent possible, monetary policy accommodation be removed in a gradual and patient manner. I would like to avoid a situation where the FOMC is playing “catch-up” in raising interest rates.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, and from a risk management point of view, I believe it will likely be appropriate, in the near future, to take the next step in the process of removing monetary accommodation. This should be done in the context of an overall strategy of removing accommodation in a gradual and patient manner. I believe this strategy will increase the likelihood of sustaining and extending the economic expansion in the U.S.\n\nTechnology-Enabled Disruption and Its Implications\n\nAs I have been discussing for the past two years, technology-enabled disruption means workers increasingly being replaced by technology. It also means that existing business models are being supplanted by new models, often technology-enabled, for more efficiently selling or distributing goods and services. In addition, consumers are increasingly being able to use technology to shop for goods and services at lower prices with greater convenience—having the impact of reducing the pricing power of businesses which has, in turn, caused them to further intensify their focus on creating greater operational efficiencies. These trends appear to be accelerating.\n\nIt is likely that disruption is a factor in economic outcomes being increasingly skewed by educational attainment levels of workers. That is, for those who have a college education, the unemployment rate stands at 2.0 percent and the labor force participation rate is 73.7 percent. If you have some college, the unemployment rate is 3.7 percent and participation is 65.8 percent; a high school diploma, the unemployment rate is 4.3 percent and participation is 56.9 percent; and some high school education, the unemployment rate is 5.7 percent and participation rate is 46.1 percent.\n\nIncreasingly, workers with lower levels of educational attainment are seeing their jobs restructured or eliminated. Unless they are retrained, these workers often see their productivity and incomes decline as a result of disruption. This may help explain the muted levels of wage gains and overall labor productivity growth we see in the U.S. as well as other advanced economies.\n\nThe impact of technology-enabled disruption on the workforce is likely less susceptible to monetary policy—it requires structural reforms. The reforms could include improving early childhood literacy and overall college readiness in order to increase the percentage of students who graduate college in six years or less—now estimated at 59 percent in the U.S.[11] It would also include stepped-up efforts to increase middle-skills training in cities across the U.S. in order to improve employment, close the skills gap (not enough workers to fill skilled jobs) and raise worker productivity. These initiatives could improve educational attainment levels in order to help our citizens better thrive in a world that increasingly demands greater education, training and adaptability.\n\nDisruption may also help explain why companies, facing one or more disruptive competitors, have been more cautious about making capacity-expansion decisions as well as investing in major capital projects. It may also help explain the record level of merger and acquisition activity globally over the last few years, as companies attempt to address disruptive changes and lack of pricing power by achieving greater scale economies in order to maintain or improve profit margins.\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI would like to acknowledge the contributions of Tyler Atkinson, Jim Dolmas, John Duca, Marc Giannoni, Evan Koenig, William Simmons, Dianne Tunnell and Mark Wynne in preparing these remarks.",

            "content": "October 17, 2017\n\nAt the September 2017 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced plans to begin the process of gradually reducing the size of the Federal Reserve balance sheet. I strongly support the decision to begin the process of reducing the balance sheet. I believe that the gradual and phased-in design of this plan should allow the Fed to reduce the Treasury and mortgage-backed securities portfolios without materially impacting either of these important markets. In the September meeting, the committee also decided to leave the target federal funds rate in a range of 100 to 125 basis points but left open the possibility of gradual removals of accommodation (i.e., raises in the federal funds rate) in the future.\n\nThe purpose of this essay is to provide a synopsis of my current views regarding the economic impact of Hurricane Harvey as well as economic conditions in the Eleventh District, U.S. and globally. I will also discuss key structural drivers, such as aging demographics, high levels of government debt to gross domestic product (GDP), globalization, and technology-enabled disruption and their implications for U.S. monetary policy.\n\nThe Dallas Fed is one of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks in the United States. The Eleventh District is composed of Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico. Texas accounts for 8.8 percent of U.S. GDP [1] and 8.4 percent of U.S. nonfarm employment.[2] It is the largest exporting state in the U.S. and is home to more than 50 Fortune 500 companies.[3] The characteristics of our district give the Dallas Fed unique insights into energy, trade and immigration issues, as well as great insight into the regional, national and global economies.\n\nWith that background, let me begin with a discussion of Hurricane Harvey and its impact on the Eleventh District as well as the U.S.\n\nThe Eleventh District is working to recover from the effects of Hurricane Harvey. It is our base-case assumption that property damage from the storm is likely to be in the range of approximately $75–$100 billion. Most of this damage was due to flooding versus wind and other forms of hurricane damage. Of that amount, we estimate that approximately $45–$55 billion was due to damage to residential property. In addition, approximately $16–$20 billion was due to commercial property damage, approximately $10–$12 billion was due to vehicle damage and another $6–$10 billion was due to infrastructure damage.[4] Unfortunately, some substantial percentage of these losses will ultimately prove to be uninsured.\n\nBefore the storm, the Dallas Fed estimated that multifamily rental housing in Houston had a relatively high vacancy rate. Since the storm, because many displaced homeowners have elected to rent (if only temporarily), occupancy rates have risen substantially and the multifamily overhang appears to have been eliminated. Further, our contacts suggest that multifamily developer/operators in Houston may accelerate their plans to build additional rental housing capacity.\n\nWe expect some short-term job loss in the Gulf Coast region of Texas in the range of 55,000 to 75,000 jobs. However, we believe that these losses will prove to be temporary.\n\nThe storm has also spurred substantial discussion of undocumented workers, in Houston specifically and in Texas generally. It is estimated that approximately 575,000 undocumented people live in the Greater Houston area.[5] Our contacts estimate that a substantial percentage of construction workers in Houston are likely undocumented. In studying the aftermath of other severe-weather events, we note that undocumented workers have historically been critical participants in the rebuilding and recovery effort.\n\nThere is significant concern about the potential failure rate of small businesses in Houston due to an extended period of business interruption and a significant amount of uninsured losses. In our Dallas Fed September surveys, 58 percent of respondents who suffered Hurricane Harvey damage reported physical capital losses that were uninsured, and 74 percent of hurricane-impacted respondents reported lost revenue and/or production that was uninsured.[6] We are mindful that banks will need to work with borrowers and make tough judgments regarding future business viability in order to help the small business community weather this crisis.\n\nOf course, the Gulf Coast is home to a substantial concentration of refinery capacity and offshore production facilities. The refinery outages resulting from Harvey-related shutdowns temporarily impacted oil inventories and gasoline prices. Our estimate is that the refinery industry came substantially back online by late September. Offshore production has more recently been impacted by Hurricane Nate, which caused substantially all Gulf of Mexico oil production facilities as well as two refineries to temporarily halt operations. While the full impact of the most recent storm has yet to be determined, Dallas Fed economists believe it will likely have only modest and temporary effects on refinery and production operations.\n\nThe recent hurricanes have not changed our basic outlook regarding global supply and demand for oil. We continue to believe that we are in a fragile equilibrium over the next few years. While there is certainly a risk that oil prices could break to the downside, the Dallas Fed’s baseline view is that there will be continued price volatility but within a band between the mid-$40s to the mid-$50s for the remainder of 2017 and 2018. Prices moving to the lower end of that range will tend to reduce prospective drilling activity, and prices moving to the higher end of that range will tend to encourage greater drilling activity.\n\nOur energy industry contacts continue to indicate that the bulk of their capital spending plans are focused on shale oil production and involve investment in technologies that will create greater production efficiencies. Our recent Dallas Fed Energy Surveys suggest that the rate of growth in capital spending on shale oil production has slowed materially relative to earlier in the year. Survey participants also continue to report that, in a number of locations, current market prices are above break-even drilling levels, particularly in the Permian Basin.\n\nOverall, we estimate that Hurricane Harvey reduced economic activity in the Eleventh District during the third quarter of 2017. We expect that the fourth quarter will show a rebound in economic activity that should more than offset the decline in the third quarter. Dallas Fed economists expect Texas job growth of approximately 2.6 percent in 2017, the strongest rate in three years. Our business outlook surveys suggest continued strong growth in the state’s manufacturing sector as well as continued strength in services.\n\nOur study of the aftermath of previous severe storms gives us confidence that, after a period of weakness, Texas economic activity will “catch up” and return to previous rates of trend growth. Our confidence in this recovery is bolstered by the continued migration (as well as immigration) of people and firms to the state. Aided by this trend, the Texas economy has, over time, become increasingly diversified. The population of Texas is estimated to have grown from approximately 22.8 million in 2005 to almost 28 million in 2016.[7] Based on these trends, and as the energy sector continues to stabilize and recover, Dallas Fed economists are optimistic about the growth prospects for Texas and the Eleventh District in the months and years ahead.\n\nGDP in the U.S. is estimated to have grown at a 1.2 percent rate in the first quarter of 2017 and a 3.1 percent rate in the second quarter. First-quarter GDP was negatively impacted by weak consumer spending and a deceleration of net inventory investment. The strong second quarter was primarily due to a rebound in consumer spending and a stabilization of inventory investment.\n\nOur Dallas Fed economists recently increased their forecast of U.S. GDP growth to approximately 2.4 percent in 2017. Embedded in this forecast is a likely drag on third-quarter GDP growth due to recent hurricanes. However, we expect a rebound in economic activity in the fourth quarter which should substantially offset hurricane-related impacts from the third quarter. The key underpinning of our forecast is our expectation of a healthy U.S. consumer. The U.S. consumer has spent the past nine years deleveraging from record levels of debt to GDP and is today in relatively good financial shape and, as a result, has capacity to spend.\n\nIn addition to a healthy consumer, we also expect GDP growth in 2017 will continue to be bolstered by some improvement in nonresidential fixed investment and international trade. We expect that this rate of GDP growth, while sluggish by historical standards, should be sufficient to remove any remaining slack from the labor market.\n\nPotential changes in fiscal policy and structural reforms could provide upside to this forecast. However, it is also the case that U.S. policy regarding trade and immigration bears watching and could have some negative impact on future rates of growth.\n\nUnemployment and the Impact of Demographic Trends\n\nThe September jobs report showed a decrease of 33,000 in payroll employment. Our Dallas Fed economists believe that the September report was significantly negatively impacted by recent hurricanes, and it will likely take some time to separate “signal” from “noise” in this report.\n\nEven with the weak September data, the year-to-date average monthly pace of job gains in 2017 has been approximately 148,000. This compares to an average of approximately 171,000 through August 2017 and 187,000 in 2016. As we move toward full employment, I would continue to expect the average rate of job growth to slow, consistent with a declining level of labor slack in the economy.\n\nIn addition to the most recent headline unemployment rate of 4.2 percent, my economic team looks at several measures of labor market slack, including estimates of discouraged workers and people working part time for economic reasons (otherwise known as U-6 unemployment), as well as the labor force participation rate.\n\nU-6 unemployment (see chart below) stands at 8.3 percent, which is the lowest rate since June 2007. Looking at this historical data suggests to me that we have moved very close to full employment in the U.S.\n\n\n\nIn addition to U-6, we also closely look at the labor force participation rate, which now stands at 63.1 percent. This compares with a participation rate of 66 percent in 2007. Our economists believe that a majority of the decline in participation is due to the aging of the population. This aging trend is expected to continue in the U.S. as well as across almost all advanced economies. Over the next 10 years, we expect that, due to aging of the workforce, the U.S. participation rate will decline to below 61 percent.[8]\n\nThe likely net impact of this aging trend will be to reduce the rate of labor force growth in the United States. You can see from the chart below that, beginning in the 2000s, population growth among those 20 to 64 years old has outpaced overall labor force growth. This trend has been due to a steadily increasing percentage of the 55–64 population within the 20–64 age cohort as well as a plateauing of the rate at which women have been entering the workforce. Dallas Fed economists expect these trends to continue as we enter the next decade.\n\nBecause GDP growth is comprised of growth in the workforce plus gains in productivity, weaker expected workforce growth trends will likely negatively affect potential GDP growth in the years ahead—unless we take steps to mitigate these effects.\n\n\n\nEducational Attainment and the Skills Gap in the U.S.\n\nWhen we look at measures of discouraged workers and those who are working part time for economic reasons, I would note the high correlation between participation rates (as well as unemployment rates) and levels of educational attainment. The labor force participation rate for prime-age workers is approximately 88 percent for college graduates and 83 percent for those who have attended some college. However, prime-age worker participation is only 77 percent for those with a high school diploma and only 66 percent for those who have less than a high school diploma.[9]\n\nWhile the labor participation rate is disappointing for those with lower levels of educational attainment, our Dallas Fed economists also note that there is a substantial skills gap in the U.S. That is, there are more job openings than workers for various types of middle-skills positions. The National Federation of Independent Business reports that as of September 2017, nearly half of small businesses indicated that they were unable to find qualified applicants to fill job openings. CEOs report difficulty in hiring workers for middle-class-wage jobs such as nurses, construction workers, truck drivers, oilfield workers, automotive technicians, industrial technicians, heavy equipment operators, computer network support specialists, web developers and insurance specialists. When these types of jobs go unfilled, U.S. businesses expand more slowly and the nation’s growth is impeded.\n\nWhile a college education is highly correlated with better employment outcomes, it is also the case that the substantial skills gap highlights the need for the U.S. to do much more to beef up public/private partnerships that focus on middle-skills training. This training is critical to help workers, who may not have attended college, attain the capabilities needed to find attractive employment in the 21st century economy.\n\nOne other significant educational concern is the lagging levels of early-childhood literacy among fast-growing demographic groups in the U.S. Studies suggest that, if a child begins first grade with reading capability behind grade level, they typically fail to catch up during their educational career.[10] This has significant implications for their ultimate level of educational attainment. As a result of this trend, the Dallas Fed has consistently highlighted the need, nationally and locally, to invest in programs that improve early-childhood literacy and generally enhance the level of educational attainment among our younger population.\n\nEducation initiatives are an investment in our future. They are likely to help in the effort to reduce income inequality by creating broader workforce productivity gains and more inclusive prosperity.\n\nInflation\n\nProgress toward reaching the Fed’s 2 percent inflation objective has been slow over the past several years. I believe this has likely been due to past strengthening of the dollar and weaker energy prices as well as a number of persistent secular forces, such as globalization and technology-enabled disruption (see “Broader Secular Trends” below).\n\nTwelve-month measures of both headline and core inflation have weakened since February 2017. While I believe that this recent weakening may well be transitory, I will continue to be patient and open-minded in assessing upcoming data releases in this regard.\n\nIn order to analyze inflation trends, our economists look at headline inflation but also track several measures of core inflation. In particular, Dallas Fed economists closely monitor our Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate (see chart below). This measure trims out the most extreme upward and downward monthly price movements and, our economists believe, represents a more reliable indicator of trend inflation. After running at approximately 1.6 percent in 2015, Trimmed Mean PCE inflation gradually increased from 1.7 to 1.9 percent during 2016. Through August 2017, this measure has fallen back to 1.6 percent on a 12-month basis.\n\n\n\nI am of the view that, despite recent weakness, as slack continues to be removed from the labor market, headline inflation should reach, or exceed, the Fed’s 2 percent objective over the medium term. However, I will be closely watching this measure in the months ahead in order to confirm that recent weakness is indeed transitory and that we are continuing to make progress in reaching our inflation objective.\n\nIn assessing economic conditions in the U.S., my research team closely monitors economic developments outside the U.S. to evaluate how these developments might impact economic growth domestically. Over the past year, we have seen a broad-based improvement in global economic activity. Brazil and Russia appear to be emerging from recession; Japan and the euro area are now growing more robustly.\n\nThe United Kingdom is still growing but at a much-reduced rate. The British government is working toward articulating a coherent vision for its post-Brexit arrangements with the European Union. Dallas Fed economists continue to believe that the impact of Brexit is likely to be manageable for the U.S.\n\nDallas Fed economists continue to carefully monitor emerging-market countries, particularly China. As discussed in previous essays, China is challenged by a high degree of overcapacity (particularly in state-owned enterprises) and high and growing levels of debt. The nation is also in the midst of a multiyear transition from being a manufacturing- and export-driven economy to one that is based on consumer spending and services. As this transition unfolds, the world is likely going to have to become accustomed to lower rates of Chinese growth. In the meantime, China is working to manage capital outflows and currency volatility. As we saw in the first quarter of 2016, this situation has the potential to create periods of financial market volatility and lead to bouts of tightening in global financial conditions, which could, in turn, slow economic growth in the U.S.\n\nAs I have discussed in almost all my recent essays and speeches, my economic research team carefully considers and works to understand cyclical forces in the economy as well as several key secular drivers. As I have emphasized over the past two years, these drivers are likely having a powerful influence on unfolding economic conditions.\n\nI have particularly focused on four key secular drivers:\n\n\n\nDisruption may also help explain why companies, facing one or more disruptive competitors, have been more cautious about making capacity-expansion decisions as well as investing in major capital projects. In my view, it may also help explain the record level of merger activity globally, as companies attempt to address disruptive changes and lack of pricing power by achieving greater scale economies in order to maintain or improve profit margins.\n\nIn light of these secular trends and the sluggish economic growth over the past several years, I have been speaking the last several months about the need for structural reforms and fiscal policy to join the menu of economic policy. Monetary policy is not designed, by itself, to address the key structural challenges we face today stemming from changing demographic trends and lower rates of productivity growth as well as dislocations created by globalization and increasing rates of technology-enabled disruption. While monetary policy has a key role to play, it is not a substitute for structural reforms and other actions that could address deeper fundamental challenges.\n\nThe primary prism I use to judge new structural reforms and potential fiscal policies is whether they help grow the labor force and/or improve productivity growth in the U.S. GDP growth is comprised of these two components, and I believe potential new policies should be judged in the context of whether they create sustainable improvement in these measures.\n\nI believe that we are making good progress in reaching our full-employment objective. The U.S. consumer is healthy, and business activity continues to strengthen. Global growth has been stronger than expected in 2017. While our estimate of 2.4 percent U.S. GDP growth in 2017 is sluggish by historical standards, it should be sufficient to continue to remove slack from the labor market.\n\nNormally, at this stage in the recovery and with a tightening labor market, we would expect to see increasing evidence of inflation pressures. I believe that cyclical inflationary pressures are building as we remove slack from the labor market and approach full employment. However, I also believe that these cyclical forces are being at least partially offset by secular forces (described earlier in this essay), particularly an intensifying rate of technology-enabled disruption and, to a lesser extent, globalization. These secular forces are likely limiting the pricing power of businesses and muting inflationary pressures.\n\nFrom a risk-management point of view, I am mindful that if we wait too long to see signs of greater inflation, we may get “behind the curve” and have to play catch up by increasing rates more rapidly. Historically, this has increased the likelihood of recession.\n\nI am also mindful that there is a cost to excessive accommodation in terms of limiting returns to savers as well as creating distortions and imbalances in investing, hiring and other business decisions. Monetary policy accommodation is not costless—it carries risks. It has been my experience that significant imbalances are often easier to recognize in hindsight and can be very painful to address.\n\nHowever, I believe that structural forces, particularly slowing workforce growth due to an aging population, will continue to pose challenges for future economic growth. As a result, my view is that the neutral rate, the interest rate at which we are neither accommodative nor restrictive, is likely to be much lower than we are historically accustomed. Therefore, I have argued that future removals of accommodation should be done in a gradual and patient manner.\n\nBased on these considerations, I intend to keep an open mind about removing accommodation in upcoming FOMC meetings. In the months ahead, I will continue to assess the economy’s progress in removing labor slack, and I will be looking for evidence that building cyclical forces have the prospect of offsetting structural headwinds, such that we can expect to make progress toward meeting our 2 percent inflation objective in the medium term. Given the strength of the U.S. economy, I think it is likely we will see greater evidence of this progress and, as a consequence, it will be appropriate to continue the process of gradually removing monetary accommodation.\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "July 13, 2017\n\nAs you know, at its June meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to increase the federal funds rate to a range of 100 to 125 basis points. I believe that this action is consistent with an approach of removing accommodation in a gradual and patient manner, based on our ongoing assessment of economic conditions. At the June meeting, we also published updated principles and plans for gradually reducing the size of the Federal Reserve balance sheet.\n\nThe purpose of this essay is to provide a synopsis of my current views regarding economic conditions in the U.S., Mexico, and globally, and my thoughts regarding the appropriate stance of U.S. monetary policy.\n\nThe Dallas Fed is one of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks in the United States. The Eleventh District is composed of Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico. Texas accounts for 8.8 percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP).[1] It is the largest exporting state in the U.S. and is home to 52 Fortune 500 companies. The characteristics of our district give the Dallas Fed unique insights into energy, trade and immigration issues, as well as great insight into the regional, national and global economies.\n\nWith that background, let me begin with a discussion of energy given its importance to the Eleventh District as well as the U.S., Mexico and the world.\n\nEnergy\n\nIt is the view of our economists at the Dallas Fed that we are in the midst of a fragile equilibrium regarding global oil supply and demand.\n\nIn our most recent Dallas Fed Energy Survey, the majority of industry respondents expect global consumption and production of oil to move into rough balance sometime in 2018. This is a delay from our previous expectation that supply and demand would come into balance during 2017. This delay comes despite implementation of the December 2016 agreement between OPEC and certain non-OPEC nations to decrease production levels by as much as 1.8 million barrels per day.\n\nOne key issue is that, while OPEC has agreed to reduce production levels, U.S. oil production has been substantially increasing. Since the fall of 2016, U.S. oil production has risen from a low of approximately 8.6 million barrels per day to approximately 9.2 million barrels a day currently. It is our estimate that U.S. production will increase to 9.8 million barrels per day by year-end 2017. There is also a question as to whether OPEC members, and other oil-producing nations, will stick to their commitments to reduce production in the face of steadily rising U.S. production. This fragile balancing process is happening in the context of record levels of excess global oil inventories.\n\nOPEC and non-OPEC countries extended their production agreement on May 25. Assuming they continue to extend their production agreement, our economists anticipate excess inventory levels should begin to consistently decline sometime during 2018. Based on these expectations, while there is certainly a risk that oil prices could break to the downside, my baseline view is that there will be continued price volatility but within a band of the $40s to the low-$50s for the remainder of 2017.\n\nOur recent Dallas Fed Energy Surveys continue to show a notable increase in plans for capital spending in 2017 by exploration and production firms, though at a slower pace in the second quarter. We observe that the bulk of these spending plans are focused on shale oil production and are likely to involve investment in technologies that will create greater production efficiencies. Survey participants report that, in a number of locations, current market prices are sufficiently above breakeven levels to encourage further rig count growth, particularly in the Permian Basin.\n\nMany of our recent discussions with industry contacts continue to be focused on the substantial potential supply upside of the Permian Basin in the years ahead. The Permian Basin has oil-bearing deposits that are layered, allowing multiple horizontal wells to run off a single well pad and much higher resource recovery per acre. The Permian currently produces approximately 2.3 million barrels per day.[2] With technological advances, many of our contacts believe that the Permian can expand production substantially in the years ahead. As a result, we expect that major oil companies, in the near term, may continue to avoid large long-lived capital projects and will, instead, focus their capital spending on more flexible and shorter-life-cycle shale opportunities in the U.S.\n\nThe District\n\nAided in part by improvement in the state’s energy sector, Dallas Fed economists expect Texas job growth of approximately 2.5 percent in 2017, the strongest rate in three years. Our business surveys suggest significantly stronger growth in the state’s manufacturing sector as well as continued strength in services.\n\nTexas continues to benefit from the migration (as well as immigration) of people and firms to the state. Aided by this trend, the state’s economy has become increasingly diversified. The population of Texas is estimated to have grown from approximately 22.8 million in 2005 to almost 28 million in 2016.[3] Based on these trends, and as the energy sector continues to strengthen and recover, Dallas Fed economists are optimistic about the growth prospects for Texas and the Eleventh District in the months and years ahead.\n\nAgainst this optimistic backdrop, I am cognizant that U.S. trade policy decisions could impact our outlook. In particular, we believe that U.S. trading and cross-border investment relationships with Mexico are important to enhancing job growth and competitiveness in the U.S. as well as economic growth in the Eleventh District.\n\nMexico is the top destination for Texas exports. Manufactured goods exports supported, directly and indirectly, an estimated 1 million jobs in Texas in 2015, equal to 8.2 percent of the state’s employment.[4] In 2016, Texas exports to Mexico were $92.7 billion. Dallas Fed economists believe that the trading relationship with Mexico has helped various industries in Texas[5] (as well as the U.S.) gain global competitiveness.[6] If this trading relationship were severely weakened, it’s our judgment that the U.S. would lose competiveness and that jobs would be lost to other parts of the world, particularly Asia. In addition, Texas border cities have benefited tremendously from the increasing U.S.–Mexico economic integration—leading to job gains, primarily in service sectors, that have resulted in higher wages and improved standards of living for many Texans.[7]\n\nThe U.S.\n\nGDP in the U.S. is estimated to have grown at a 1.4 percent rate in the first quarter of 2017. This disappointing rate of growth was due to weak growth in consumer spending as well as a significant inventory deceleration.\n\nDespite this poor start to the year, our Dallas Fed economists expect GDP growth slightly in excess of 2 percent in 2017. The key underpinning of our forecast is our expectation of a strong U.S. consumer. The U.S. consumer has spent the past nine years deleveraging from record levels of debt to GDP and is today in relatively good financial shape and, as a result, has capacity to spend.\n\nIn addition to a strong consumer, we also expect GDP growth in 2017 to be bolstered by some improvement in nonresidential fixed investment. We expect that our estimate of GDP growth, while sluggish by historical standards, will be sufficient to remove remaining slack from the labor market.\n\nPotential changes in fiscal policy and structural reforms could provide upside to this forecast. However, it is also the case that U.S. policy uncertainty in key areas and the rhetoric associated with the public debate regarding these potential policies bear watching and could impact negatively the propensity of certain groups of consumers to spend versus save.\n\nUnemployment\nWe are making good progress toward reaching our full-employment objective. The June jobs report showed an increase of 222,000 jobs and an unemployment rate of 4.4 percent. The average monthly pace of job gains in 2017 is approximately 180,000 versus 187,000 in 2016. As we move forward, I would not be surprised if the average rate of job growth continued to slow, consistent with a declining level of labor slack in the economy.\n\nIn addition to the headline unemployment rate, my economic team looks at several measures of labor market slack, including estimates of discouraged workers and people working part time for economic reasons (otherwise known as U-6 unemployment), as well as the labor force participation rate.\n\nU-6 unemployment (see chart below) now stands at 8.6 percent, which compares with a prerecession quarterly low of 8.1 percent. Looking at this historical data suggests to me that we are moving very close to full employment in the U.S.\n\n\n\nIn addition to U-6, we also closely look at the labor force participation rate, which now stands at 62.8 percent. This compares with a participation rate of 66 percent in 2007. Our economists believe that a majority of the decline in participation is due to the aging of the population. This aging trend is expected to continue in the U.S. as well as across almost all advanced economies. Over the next 10 years, we estimate that, due to aging of the workforce, the U.S. participation rate will decline to below 61 percent.[8]\n\nThe net impact of this aging trend has been, and is likely to be in the future, a reduction in the rate of labor force growth. You can see from the chart below that, beginning in the 2000s, population growth among those 20 to 64 years old has outpaced overall labor force growth. This trend has been due to a steadily increasing percentage of the 55–64 population within the 20–64 age cohort as well as a plateauing of the rate at which women have been entering the workforce. Dallas Fed economists expect these trends to continue as we head toward the 2020s.\n\nBecause GDP growth is comprised of growth in the workforce plus gains in productivity, weaker expected workforce growth trends will likely have significant negative implications for potential GDP growth in the years ahead—unless we take steps to mitigate these effects.\n\n\n\nTackling the Skills Gap in the U.S.\nWhen we look at measures of discouraged workers and those who are working part time for economic reasons, I would note the high correlation between participation rates (as well as unemployment rates) and levels of educational attainment. The labor force participation rate for prime-age workers is approximately 88 percent for college graduates and 81 percent for those who have attended some college. However, prime-age worker participation is only 76 percent for those with a high school diploma and only 66 percent for those who have less than a high school diploma.\n\nOur economists at the Dallas Fed believe that the skills gap in the U.S. is substantial. The National Federation of Independent Business reports that as of June 2017, 46 percent of small businesses indicated that they were unable to find qualified applicants to fill job openings. CEOs report difficulty in hiring workers for middle-class-wage jobs such as nurses, construction workers, truck drivers, oilfield workers, automotive technicians, industrial technicians, heavy equipment operators, computer network support specialists, web developers and insurance specialists. When these types of jobs go unfilled, U.S. businesses expand more slowly and the nation’s growth is impeded.\n\nThis substantial skills gap highlights the need for the U.S. to do much more to beef up public/private partnerships that focus on skills training in order to help workers attain the capabilities needed to find employment in the 21st century economy. We also need to invest in programs that improve early-childhood literacy and generally enhance the level of educational attainment among our younger population. Both of these types of initiatives have the added benefit of helping to potentially reduce income inequality by creating broader workforce productivity gains and prosperity.\n\nInflation\nProgress toward reaching our 2 percent inflation objective has been slow over the past several years. I believe this has likely been due to a rising dollar and weaker energy prices, as well as a number of persistent secular forces, such as globalization and technology-enabled disruption (see “Broader Secular Trends” below).\n\nTwelve-month measures of headline and core inflation fell in March, April and May. While I believe that this recent weakening may well be transitory, I intend to be patient and open-minded in assessing upcoming data releases in this regard.\n\nIn order to analyze inflation trends, our economists look at headline inflation but also track several measures of core inflation. In particular, Dallas Fed economists closely monitor our Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate (see chart below). This measure trims out the most extreme upward and downward monthly price movements and, our economists believe, represents a more reliable indicator of the trend of inflation. The measure gradually increased from 1.7 to 1.8 percent during 2016 after running at approximately 1.6 percent in 2015. Through May 2017, it is running at approximately 1.7 percent on a 12-month basis after having touched 1.9 percent in January. I am of the view that, despite recent weakness, as slack continues to be removed from the labor market, headline inflation should reach, or exceed, the Fed’s 2 percent longer-run objective in the medium term. However, I will be closely watching this measure in the months ahead in order to confirm that recent weakness is indeed transitory and that we are continuing to make progress in reaching our inflation objective.\n\n\n\nNon-U.S.\n\nIn assessing economic conditions in the U.S., my research team closely monitors economic developments outside the U.S. to evaluate how these developments might impact economic growth domestically. In this regard, we are closely monitoring the evolving situation regarding the United Kingdom’s future relationship with the European Union. At this stage, I believe that the impact of Brexit is likely to be manageable for the U.S., although we are continuing to carefully monitor political developments and other policy decisions that could create a risk of contagion among other European countries.\n\nWe also monitor the major emerging-market countries, particularly China. China is challenged by a high degree of overcapacity (particularly in state-owned enterprises) and high and growing levels of debt. The nation is also in the midst of a multiyear transition from being a manufacturing- and export-driven economy to one that is based on consumer spending and services. This transition is likely to take many years, and the world is going to have to become accustomed to lower rates of Chinese growth. In the meantime, China has worked to manage capital outflows and currency volatility. As we saw in the first quarter of 2016, this situation has the potential to create periods of financial market volatility and lead to bouts of tightening in global financial conditions, which could, in turn, slow economic growth in the U.S.\n\nThe Mexico Economy\n\nAs I discussed earlier in this essay, Mexico is a very important relationship for the United States as well as the Eleventh District of the Federal Reserve. The Mexico economy grew an estimated 2.7 percent in the first quarter of 2017 and is expected to grow at approximately 2 percent for the full year. This compares with 2.3 percent growth in 2016.\n\nFor a number of reasons, including weakness in the energy sector as well as concerns regarding trade relations with the U.S., the peso has been highly volatile over the past 18 months. From November 2016 through January 2017, it declined as much as 15 percent against the dollar, and has since appreciated roughly 20 percent—and now stands at a higher level than immediately prior to the U.S. election. Due at least in part to previous weakness in the currency, Mexico inflation has risen substantially and is now estimated at well above the central bank’s 3 percent inflation target. In response, Banco de México has raised its policy rate 10 times over the past 19 months to 7 percent in order to stem price pressures. The central bank’s actions have created headwinds for short-term economic growth but should help anchor inflation expectations in the medium and long term.\n\nIn addition, between 2012 and 2014, the Mexican government initiated a broad set of structural reforms aimed at improving labor practices and fiscal policy as well as liberalizing the financial, telecommunications, energy and education sectors. These sweeping reforms are aimed at boosting national productivity and competitiveness.\n\nBroader Secular Trends\n\nIn addition to monitoring cyclical trends, my economic research team carefully considers and works to understand several key secular drivers. As I have emphasized over the past year, these drivers are likely having a powerful influence on unfolding economic conditions.\n\nI have particularly focused on four key secular drivers:\n\nIn light of these secular trends and the sluggish economic growth over the past several years, I have been speaking the last several months about the need for structural reforms and fiscal policy to join the menu of economic policy. Monetary policy is not designed, by itself, to address the key structural challenges we face today stemming from changing demographic trends and lower rates of productivity growth, as well as dislocations created by globalization and increasing rates of technology-enabled disruption. While monetary policy has a key role to play, it is not a substitute for structural reforms and other actions that could address deeper fundamental challenges.\n\nThe primary prism I use to judge new structural reforms and potential fiscal policies is whether they help grow the labor force and/or improve productivity growth in the U.S. GDP growth is comprised of these two components, and I believe potential new policies should be judged in the context of whether they create sustainable improvement in these measures.\n\nThe Current Stance of Monetary Policy\n\nAs I mentioned earlier in this essay, I believe that we are making good progress in accomplishing our dual-mandate objectives of full employment and price stability. However, I am cognizant that progress toward our 2 percent inflation goal has been slow and, at times, uneven. I intend to be patient in critically assessing upcoming data to evaluate whether we are continuing to make progress in reaching our inflation objective.\n\nI have consistently stated that I believe there is a cost to excessive accommodation in terms of limiting returns to savers, as well as creating distortions and imbalances in investing, hiring and other business decisions. Monetary policy accommodation is not costless. It has been my experience that significant imbalances are often easier to recognize in hindsight and can be very painful to address.\n\nHowever, I also believe that the key secular drivers discussed earlier in this essay will continue to pose challenges for economic growth. As a result, my view is that the neutral rate, the rate at which we are neither accommodative nor restrictive, is likely to be much lower than we are historically accustomed.\n\nBased on these considerations, I have argued that future removals of accommodation should be done in a gradual and patient manner. “Gradual and patient” means to me that I will be open to updating my views on the economic outlook and the appropriate stance of monetary policy based on incoming economic information. I will avoid being rigid or unduly predetermined in my views.\n\nAt present, with a federal funds rate at a range of 100 to 125 basis points, I would like to see some greater evidence that we are making progress toward meeting our 2 percent inflation objective in the medium term. I am cognizant that several secular forces (described earlier in this essay), particularly an intensifying rate of technology-enabled disruption, are likely impacting the pricing power of businesses and creating downward pressure on inflation. I plan to continue to work to try to better understand the impact of these secular forces in the weeks and months ahead.\n\nSeparately, with the Federal Open Market Committee having now published updated principles and plans for reducing the size of the Fed’s balance sheet, I believe it will likely be appropriate to begin the process of balance-sheet reduction sometime later this year.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "May 22, 2017\n\nAs you know, at its May meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to leave the federal funds rate unchanged at a range of 75 to 100 basis points. I believe that this action is consistent with an approach of removing accommodation only in a gradual and patient manner, based on our ongoing assessment of economic conditions.\n\nThe purpose of this essay is to provide a synopsis of my current views regarding economic conditions in the U.S. and globally, and my thoughts regarding the appropriate stance of U.S. monetary policy.\n\nThe Dallas Fed is one of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks in the United States. The Eleventh District is composed of Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico. Texas accounts for 8.8 percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP).[1] It is the largest exporting state in the U.S. and is home to 52 Fortune 500 companies. The characteristics of our district give the Dallas Fed unique insights into energy, trade and immigration issues, as well as great insight into the regional, national and global economies.\n\nWith that background, let me begin with a discussion of energy, given its importance to the Eleventh District as well as the nation and the world.\n\nEnergy\n\nIt is the view of our economists at the Dallas Fed that we are in the midst of a fragile equilibrium regarding global oil supply and demand.\n\nBased on the expectation that global daily oil demand will grow, on average, at approximately 1.3 million barrels per day, we estimate that global consumption and production of oil will move into rough balance sometime in 2017. This balancing process has been helped by the implementation of the December 2016 agreement between OPEC and certain non-OPEC nations to decrease production levels by as much as 1.8 million barrels per day.\n\nThe fragility comes from the fact that, while OPEC has agreed to reduce production levels, U.S. oil production is increasing for the first time in over two years. Since the fall of 2016, U.S. oil production has risen from a low of approximately 8.6 million barrels per day to approximately 9.2 million barrels a day currently. It is our estimate that U.S. production will increase to approximately 9.7 million barrels per day by year-end 2017. The question is whether OPEC members, and other oil-producing nations, will stick to their commitments to reduce production in the face of steadily rising U.S. production. This fragile balancing process is happening in the context of record levels of excess global oil inventories.\n\nAssuming that OPEC and non-OPEC countries extend their production agreements, as we expect, our economists anticipate excess inventory levels should begin to consistently decline sometime later this year. Based on the expectation that the market will unfold in this manner, I would expect continued price volatility but within a roughly stable band of the mid-$40s to the mid-$50s for the remainder of 2017.\n\nBased on these price expectations, our latest Dallas Fed Energy Survey reports a notable increase in plans for capital spending in 2017 by exploration and production firms. We observe that the bulk of these spending plans are focused on shale production and are likely to involve investment in technologies that will create greater production efficiencies. Survey participants report that, in a number of locations, current market prices are sufficiently above breakeven levels to encourage further rig count growth, particularly in the Permian Basin.\n\nMany of our recent discussions with industry contacts continue to be focused on the substantial potential supply upside of the Permian Basin in the years ahead. The Permian Basin has oil-bearing deposits that are layered, allowing multiple horizontal wells to run off a single well pad and much higher resource recovery per acre. The Permian currently produces approximately 2.3 million barrels per day.[2] With technological advances, many of our contacts believe that the Permian can expand production substantially in the years ahead. As a result, we expect that major oil companies, in the near term, may continue to avoid large long-lived capital projects and will, instead, focus their capital spending on more flexible and shorter life-cycle shale opportunities in the U.S.\n\nThe District\n\nAided in part by improvement in the state’s energy sector, Dallas Fed economists expect Texas job growth of approximately 2 to 2.5 percent in 2017, the strongest rate in three years. Our business surveys suggest improving conditions in the state’s manufacturing sector as well as continued strength in services.\n\nTexas continues to benefit from the migration (as well as immigration) of people and firms to the state. Aided by this trend, the state’s economy has become increasingly diversified. The population of Texas is estimated to have grown from approximately 22.8 million in 2005 to almost 28 million in 2016.[3] Based on these trends, and as the energy sector continues to strengthen and recover, Dallas Fed economists are optimistic about the growth prospects for Texas and the Eleventh District in the months and years ahead.\n\nAgainst this optimistic backdrop, I am cognizant that U.S. trade policy decisions could impact our outlook. In particular, we believe that U.S. trading and cross-border investment relationships with Mexico are important to enhancing job growth and competitiveness in the U.S. as well as economic growth in the Eleventh District.\n\nMexico is the top destination for Texas exports. Manufactured goods exports supported, directly and indirectly, an estimated 1 million jobs in Texas in 2015, equal to 8.2 percent of the state’s employment.[4] In 2016, Texas exports to Mexico were $92.7 billion. Dallas Fed economists believe that the trading relationship with Mexico has helped various industries in Texas[5] (as well as the U.S.) gain global competitiveness. If this trading relationship were severely weakened, it’s our judgment that the U.S. would lose competitiveness and that jobs would be lost to other parts of the world, particularly Asia. In addition, Texas border cities have benefited tremendously from the increasing U.S.–Mexico economic integration—leading to job gains, primarily in service sectors, that have resulted in higher wages and improved standards of living for many Texans.[6]\n\nThe U.S.\n\nGDP in the U.S. is estimated to have grown at a 0.7 percent rate in the first quarter of 2017. This disappointing level of growth was due to weak growth in consumer spending as well as a significant inventory deceleration.\n\nDespite this poor start to the year, our Dallas Fed economists expect GDP growth of approximately 2.25 percent in 2017. The key underpinning of our forecast is our expectation of a strong U.S. consumer. The U.S. consumer has spent the past nine years deleveraging from record levels of debt to GDP and is today in relatively good financial shape and, as a result, has capacity to spend.\n\nIn addition to a strong consumer, we also expect GDP growth in 2017 to be bolstered by some improvement in the level of nonresidential fixed business investment. We expect that our estimate of GDP growth, while sluggish by historical standards, will be sufficient to remove remaining slack from the labor market.\n\nPotential changes in fiscal policy and structural reforms have the potential to provide upside to this forecast. However, I am also closely monitoring the potential negative effects of policies that could reduce the affordability of and access to health care, and policies that could negatively influence the spending habits of immigrants who reside in the U.S. Policy uncertainty in these key areas and the rhetoric associated with the public debate regarding these potential policies bear watching as our economists assess the propensity of consumers to spend versus save.\n\nUnemployment\nWe are making good progress toward reaching our full-employment objective. The most recent April jobs report showed an increase of 211,000 jobs and a decline in the headline unemployment rate to 4.4 percent. This report is consistent with the three-, six- and nine-month average gains of approximately 180,000 new jobs per month. As we move forward, I would not be surprised if the average rate of job growth slowed somewhat, consistent with a declining level of labor slack in the economy.\n\nIn addition to the headline unemployment rate, my economic team looks at several measures of labor market slack, including estimates of discouraged workers and people working part time for economic reasons (otherwise known as U-6 unemployment), as well as the labor force participation rate.\n\nU-6 unemployment (see chart below) now stands at 8.6 percent, which compares with a prerecession low of 8.1 percent. Looking at this historical data suggests to me that we are moving very close to full employment in the U.S.\n\n\n\nIn addition to U-6, we also closely look at the labor force participation rate, which now stands at 62.9 percent. This compares with a participation rate of 66 percent in 2007. Our economists believe that a majority of the decline in participation is due to the aging of the population. This aging trend is expected to continue in the U.S. as well as across almost all advanced economies. Over the next 10 years, we estimate that, due to aging of the workforce, the U.S. participation rate will decline to below 61 percent.[7]\n\nThe net impact of this aging trend has been, and is likely to be in the future, a reduction in the rate of labor force growth. You can see from the chart (below) that, beginning in the 2000s, population growth among those 20 to 64 years old has outpaced overall labor force growth. This trend has been due to a steadily increasing percentage of the 55–64 population within the 20–64 age range as well as a slowdown in the rate at which women have been entering the workforce. Dallas Fed economists expect these trends to continue as we head toward the 2020s.\n\nBecause GDP growth is comprised of growth in the workforce plus gains in productivity, weaker expected workforce growth trends will likely have significant negative implications for potential GDP growth in the years ahead—unless we take steps to mitigate these effects.\n\n\n\nTackling the Skills Gap in the U.S.\nWhen we look at measures of discouraged workers and those who are working part time for economic reasons, I would note the high correlation between participation rates (as well as unemployment rates) and levels of educational attainment. The labor force participation rate for prime-age workers is approximately 88 percent for college graduates and 81 percent for those who have attended some college. However, prime-age worker participation is only 76 percent for those with a high school diploma and only 66 percent for those who have less than a high school diploma.\n\nOur economists at the Dallas Fed believe that the skills gap in the U.S. is substantial. The National Federation of Independent Business reports that as of April 2017, 48 percent of small businesses indicated that they were unable to find qualified applicants to fill job openings. CEOs report difficulty in hiring workers for middle-class-wage jobs such as nurses, construction workers, truck drivers, oilfield workers, automotive technicians, industrial technicians, heavy equipment operators, computer network support specialists, web developers and insurance specialists. When these types of jobs go unfilled, U.S. businesses expand more slowly and the nation’s growth is impeded.\n\nThis is why I have been regularly talking about the need for the U.S. to do much more to beef up public/private partnerships that focus on skills training in order to help workers attain the skills needed to find employment in the 21st-century economy. We also need to invest in programs that improve early-childhood literacy and generally enhance the level of educational attainment among our younger population. Both of these types of initiatives have the added benefit of helping to potentially reduce income inequality by creating broader workforce productivity gains and prosperity.\n\nInflation\nProgress toward reaching our 2 percent inflation objective has been slow over the past several years. I believe this has likely been due to a rising dollar and weaker energy prices, as well as a number of persistent secular forces, such as globalization and technology-enabled disruption (see “Broader Secular Trends” below).\n\nTwelve-month measures of headline and core inflation fell in March. Inflation readings, to date, for April show further weakness. While I believe that these recent readings are likely not indicative of a weakening trend, I intend to be patient and open minded in assessing upcoming data releases in this regard.\n\nIn order to analyze inflation trends, our economists look at headline inflation but also track several measures of core inflation. In particular, Dallas Fed economists closely monitor our Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate (see chart below). This measure trims out the most extreme upward and downward monthly price movements and, our economists believe, represents a more reliable indicator of the trend of inflation. This measure gradually increased from 1.7 to 1.8 percent through most of 2016 and ran at approximately 1.6 percent in 2015. Through March, it is running at approximately 1.8 percent on a 12-month basis after having touched 1.9 percent in January and February. The gradual upward trend of this measure has given me confidence that, as slack continues to be removed from the labor market, headline inflation should reach, or exceed, the Fed’s 2 percent longer-run objective in the medium term. I will be closely watching this measure in the months ahead in order to confirm that we are continuing to make progress in reaching our inflation objective.\n\n\n\nNon-U.S.\n\nIn assessing economic conditions in the U.S., my research team closely monitors economic developments outside the U.S. to evaluate how these developments might impact economic growth domestically. In this regard, we are closely watching the impact of Brexit on the U.K. and European economies as well as monitoring new developments in Europe. At this stage, I believe that the impact of Brexit is likely to be manageable for the U.S., although we are continuing to carefully monitor political developments and other policy decisions that could create a risk of contagion among other European countries.\n\nWe also monitor emerging-market countries, particularly China. China has a high degree of overcapacity (particularly in state-owned enterprises) and high and growing levels of debt. The nation is also in the midst of a multiyear transition from being a manufacturing- and export-driven economy to one that is based on consumer spending and services. This transition is likely to take many years, and the world is going to have to become accustomed to lower rates of Chinese growth. In the meantime, China has worked to manage capital outflows and currency volatility. As we saw in the first quarter of 2016, this situation has the potential to create periods of financial market volatility and lead to bouts of tightening in global financial conditions, which could, in turn, slow economic growth in the U.S.\n\nBroader Secular Trends\n\nIn addition to monitoring cyclical trends, my economic research team carefully considers and works to understand several key secular drivers. As I have emphasized over the past year, these drivers are likely having a powerful influence on unfolding economic conditions.\n\nI have particularly focused on four key secular drivers:\n\nIn light of these secular trends and the sluggish economic growth over the past several years, I have been speaking the past several months about the need for structural reforms and fiscal policy to join the menu of economic policy.

However, I am cognizant that progress toward our 2 percent inflation goal has been slow and, at times, uneven. I intend to be patient in critically assessing upcoming data to evaluate whether we are continuing to make progress in reaching our inflation objective.\n\nI have consistently stated that I believe there is a cost to excessive accommodation in terms of limiting returns to savers, as well as creating distortions and imbalances in investing, hiring and other business decisions. Monetary policy accommodation is not costless. It has been my experience that significant imbalances are often easier to recognize in hindsight and can be very painful to address.\n\nHowever, I also believe that the key secular drivers discussed earlier in this essay will continue to pose challenges for economic growth. As a result, my view is that the neutral rate, the rate at which we are neither accommodative nor restrictive, is likely to be much lower than we are historically accustomed.\n\nBased on these considerations, I have argued that future removals of accommodation should be done in a gradual and patient manner. In that regard, I continue to believe that three rate increases for 2017, including the March increase, is an appropriate baseline case for the near-term path of the federal funds rate.\n\n“Gradual and patient” means to me that I need to be open to assessing incoming economic information in order to update my analysis regarding the appropriate stance of economic policy. I will avoid being rigid or unduly predetermined in my views. If I see information that suggests the economy is developing more slowly than I expect, then the pace of rate increases could be slower than my baseline path, and if economic growth is stronger than I expect, the pace of increases could be faster.\n\nIn addition, as we make further progress in removing accommodation, I believe we should begin the process of gradually reducing the size of the Federal Reserve balance sheet. I think it will likely be appropriate to begin this process sometime later this year.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "February 13, 2017\n\nI have been president and CEO of the Dallas Fed since the fall of 2015. The Dallas Fed is one of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks in the United States. The Eleventh District is composed of Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico. Texas accounts for 8.9 percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP).[1] It is the largest exporting state in the U.S. and is home to 52 Fortune 500 companies. The characteristics of our district give the Dallas Fed unique insights into energy, trade and immigration issues, as well as great insight into the regional, national and global economies.\n\nWith that backdrop, I’m going to briefly discuss my assessment of economic conditions in the U.S. and globally and the implications for monetary policy.\n\nEnergy\n\nLet me start with a discussion of energy, given its importance to my district as well as the national and global economies.\n\nIt is our view at the Dallas Fed that global consumption and production of oil will get into rough balance sometime during the first half of 2017. This process could be accelerated if there is implementation of the agreement between OPEC (and some non-OPEC) nations to limit production levels.\n\nWhile there is some debate about the timing of reaching balance, we believe that the overall trend is the key—we are moving toward balance. This balancing process has been more painful and taken longer than many expected. While U.S. crude oil production has fallen as much as 1 million barrels per day over the past year, this decline has been more than offset by production increases in Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iran and other oil-producing countries. As a result of these developments, global oil supply reductions have been slow to materialize, and inventories of oil products now stand at record-high levels.\n\nThe move toward balance is based on the expectation that global supply will grow at a slower rate and that global demand will to continue to grow, on average, at approximately 1.3 million barrels per day in 2017. As this process unfolds, we expect the price of oil to be volatile but, overall, continue to firm.\n\nIn this context, our economists at the Dallas Fed expect U.S. crude oil production to rise throughout 2017. Using rough numbers, it is estimated that U.S. production bottomed out at approximately 8.6 million barrels per day in the fall of 2016 and is now closer to 8.9 million barrels per day and is likely to steadily increase as the year unfolds.[2] These estimates are subject to oil prices ranging between $55 and $60 per barrel.\n\nBased on the expectation of firming prices, our latest Dallas Fed Energy Survey reports a notable increase in plans for capital spending in 2017 by exploration and production firms. We believe that the bulk of this spending will be focused on shale production and is likely to involve investment in technologies that will create greater production efficiencies.\n\nMuch of our recent discussions with industry contacts are focused on the substantial potential supply upside from the Permian Basin in the years ahead. The Permian Basin has oil-bearing deposits that are layered, allowing multiple horizontal wells to run off a single well pad and much higher resource recovery per acre. The Permian currently produces approximately 2.2 million barrels per day.[3] With technological advances, many of our contacts believe that the Permian can grow production very substantially in the years ahead. As a result, we expect that major oil companies, in the near term, may continue to avoid large long-lived capital projects and will, instead, focus their capital spending on more flexible and shorter life cycle shale opportunities in the U.S.\n\nThe District\n\nTexas’ 2016 employment grew 1.4 percent. The year was very much a tale of two halves, with just 0.8 percent annualized job growth over the first six months and 2 percent growth over the final six months. Based on our surveys and discussions with business contacts, we expect job growth of approximately 2 percent in 2017, the strongest rate of growth in three years.\n\nTexas continues to benefit from the migration (as well as immigration) of people and firms to the state. Aided by this trend, the state’s economy has become increasingly diversified. In addition, the population of Texas is estimated to have grown from approximately 22.8 million in 2005 to almost 28 million in 2016.[4] Based on these trends, as the headwinds from a weak energy sector continue to dissipate, I am very optimistic about the growth prospects for Texas and the Eleventh District in the months and years ahead.\n\nAgainst this optimistic backdrop, my team of economists is closely monitoring policy decisions that might negatively impact our outlook—in particular, policy decisions that could negatively impact U.S. trading and cross-border investment relationships with Mexico, which we believe are important to enhancing job growth and competitiveness in the U.S. as well as economic growth in the Eleventh District. Mexico is the top destination for Texas exports. Manufactured goods exports supported an estimated 1 million jobs in Texas in 2015, equal to 8.2 percent of the state’s employment.[5] In 2016, Texas exports to Mexico were $92.7 billion. Dallas Fed economists believe that the trading relationship with Mexico has helped various industries in Texas [6] (as well as the U.S.) gain global competitiveness. In addition, Texas border cities have benefited tremendously from the increasing U.S.–Mexico economic integration—leading to job gains, primarily in service sectors, that have resulted in higher wages and improved standards of living for many Texans.[7]\n\nThe U.S.\n\nGDP in the U.S. grew approximately 2 percent in 2016—reflecting an improvement in growth in the second half of the year. Underpinning weak growth in the first half of the year was the financial turmoil in the first quarter as well as a sizable inventory deceleration in the second quarter. We had expected a second-half bounce back due to our confidence in the health of the U.S. consumer. While the U.S. consumer has spent the past nine years deleveraging from record levels of debt to GDP in 2008, as we sit here today, we believe the U.S. consumer is in relatively good shape and has the capacity to spend.\n\nBased on our confidence in the continuing health of the U.S. consumer, we forecast 2017 GDP growth of approximately 2.3 percent. We believe this pace of growth will be sufficient to remove any remaining slack from the labor market. Forthcoming fiscal policy and structural reforms have the potential to provide upside to this forecast.\n\nUnemployment\n\nWe are making good progress toward reaching our full-employment objective. The headline unemployment rate is 4.8 percent. In addition to the headline unemployment rate, we also look at several measures of labor market slack, including estimates of discouraged workers and people working part time for economic reasons (otherwise known as U-6 unemployment), as well as the labor force participation rate. The U-6 reading now stands at 9.4 percent, which is still more than a full percentage point above its prerecession lows—which suggests there could still be some amount of remaining slack in the U.S. labor force.\n\nThe labor force participation rate now stands at just under 63 percent, which compares with approximately 66 percent in 2007. We believe that a majority of the decline is due to the aging of the population. This aging trend is expected to continue in the U.S. as well as across almost all advanced economies. Furthermore, over the next 10 years, it is estimated that the U.S. participation rate will decline to below 61 percent.[8] Without a material improvement in the rate of U.S. productivity growth, this trend is likely to have significant negative implications for potential GDP growth in the years ahead.\n\nWhen we look at measures of discouraged workers and those who are part time for economic reasons, I would note the high correlation between participation rates (as well as unemployment rates) and levels of educational attainment. To the extent that there is slack in the labor market, it is primarily associated with lower levels of educational attainment. This analysis suggests to me that the U.S. must do much more to beef up public/private partnerships that focus on vocational training in order to help workers attain the skills needed to find employment in the 21st century economy. These statistics also reinforce the need to invest in programs that improve early-childhood literacy and generally enhance the level of educational attainment among our younger population. Both of these types of programs also have the added benefit of helping to potentially reduce income inequality by creating broader workforce productivity and prosperity.\n\nInflation\n\nProgress toward reaching our 2 percent inflation objective has been frustratingly slow over the past few years. This had been due to a strong dollar and weak energy prices, as well as a number of persistent secular forces, such as globalization (see “Broader Secular Trends” below).\n\nIn addition to headline inflation, we closely track measures of core inflation, particularly the Dallas Fed’s Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate. This measure trims out the most extreme upward and downward monthly price movements. It is currently running at approximately 1.8 percent, after having gradually increased from 1.7 percent through most of 2016 and approximately 1.6 percent in 2015. The gradual upward trend of this measure gives me confidence that, as slack continues to be removed from the labor force, the headline inflation rate should reach the Fed’s 2 percent objective in the medium term.\n\nNon-U.S.\n\nIn assessing economic conditions in the U.S., my research team closely monitors economic developments outside the U.S. to assess how these developments might impact economic growth domestically. In this regard, we are closely watching the impact of Brexit on the U.K. and European economies as well as monitoring new developments in Europe. At this stage, I believe that the impact of Brexit is likely to be manageable for the U.S., although we are continuing to carefully monitor political developments and other policy decisions that could create a risk of contagion among other European countries.\n\nWe also monitor emerging-market countries, particularly China. China has a high degree of overcapacity (particularly in state-owned enterprises) and high and growing levels of debt. The nation is also in the midst of a multi-year transition from being a manufacturing- and export-driven economy to one that is based on consumer spending and services. This transition is likely to take many years, and the world is going to have to become accustomed to lower rates of Chinese growth. In the meantime, China has worked to manage capital outflows and currency volatility. As we saw in the first quarter of 2016, this situation has the potential to create periods of financial market volatility and lead to bouts of tightening in global financial conditions, which can lead to slower domestic growth in the U.S.\n\nBroader Secular Trends\n\nIn addition to monitoring cyclical trends, my economic research team carefully considers and works to understand several key secular drivers. These drivers can have a powerful influence on unfolding economic conditions.\n\nI am particularly focused on four key secular drivers:\n\nFiscal and Structural Policies Beyond Monetary Policy\n\nIn light of these secular trends and the sluggish economic growth over the past several years, I have been speaking the last several months about the need for structural reforms and fiscal policy to join the menu of economic policy. Monetary policy is not designed, by itself, to address the key structural challenges we face today stemming from changing demographic trends and lower levels of productivity growth, as well as dislocations created by globalization and increasing rates of technology-enabled disruption. While monetary policy has a key role to play, it is not a substitute for actions that could address deeper fundamental challenges.\n\nFor the past eight years, in the aftermath of the Great Recession, advanced economies have relied heavily on monetary policy and much less on structural reforms and fiscal policy. However, at this stage, if we are going to generate higher sustainable rates of GDP growth and address key secular challenges, there needs to be policy action beyond monetary policy. This action could take a variety of forms.\n\nGiven aging-workforce demographics, more could be done to explore policies that could grow the workforce in the years ahead. Appropriate immigration policy is likely to be a key element of this effort. Historically, immigration has played an important role in economic growth in the U.S. It is estimated that immigrants and their children have constituted over half the workforce growth in the U.S. over the past 20 years. Over the next two decades, this percentage is likely to increase substantially.[11] In Texas, immigration has been instrumental in bolstering the high-skilled labor force. Today, it is estimated that foreign-born workers in the state make up approximately 54 percent of medical scientists, 46 percent of computer software developers, 31 percent of physicians, and over a quarter of chemical and mechanical engineers and nurses. Foreign-born workers also constitute a substantial share of college instructors in the state.[12]\n\nPolicies that involve greater emphasis on improving levels of educational attainment and workforce skills are needed to help ensure that an increasing percentage of the population can become productive members of the workforce. As discussed earlier, these efforts should include a focus on substantially increasing the number of public/private partnerships that focus on vocational training that would increase the skill levels and/or retrain discouraged or underemployed workers. These programs could help grow the workforce and address the skills gap that has been identified by numerous companies we speak with in the Eleventh District.\n\nPublic investments that upgrade aging infrastructure could potentially improve productivity and help bolster sluggish demand. Given sizable private pools of capital that exist today, some meaningful portion of this investment could come from public/private partnerships, with substantial capital coming from the private sector.\n\nMore broadly, tax and regulatory policies could be considered in order to create increased incentives for growth and investment. Some observers suggest conducting a thoughtful review of regulations at the national, state and local levels. They argue that, in some cases, excessive regulation and fees might be creating undue burdens on capital investment, lending and the formation and growth of small businesses.\n\nEntitlement reforms could help improve the sustainability of Social Security and Medicare and ease the future fiscal burden of these programs. In addition, reforms might reduce disincentives to remain in the workforce while helping to soften the impact of aging-workforce demographics.\n\nThese are some examples of policy actions that could be considered. Whatever policy actions are enacted, I believe they need to center on the goals of growing the workforce and improving workforce productivity. They should focus on sustainable economic growth over the medium and long term—that is, avoiding policies that create short-term growth while creating future problems or raising government debt relative to GDP, thereby leaving future generations to resolve fiscal and/or other imbalances.\n\nMy Views Regarding the Current Stance of Monetary Policy\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I believe we are making good progress in accomplishing our dual-mandate objectives of full employment and price stability. Regarding our full-employment mandate, I believe there is still some amount of slack in the U.S. workforce. In addition, I continue to believe that in a more interconnected world, excess capacity outside the U.S. may be dampening inflation pressures in the U.S. As a result of these factors, I think we still may have some scope for further job growth without overheating the economy or unduly stressing the capacity of the U.S. workforce. However, having said that, it is my view that we are moving closer to full employment.\n\nRegarding inflation, I believe that as the impact of lower energy prices begins to dissipate, and as the labor market continues to tighten, headline inflation is likely to move toward our 2 percent objective over the medium term.\n\nWhile the key secular drivers I discussed earlier will continue to pose challenges for economic growth, I also believe there is a cost to excessive accommodation in terms of penalizing savers, as well as creating distortions and imbalances in investing, hiring and other business decisions. These imbalances are often easier to recognize in hindsight and can be very painful to address.\n\nBased on these considerations, as we continue to make progress in achieving our dual-mandate objectives, I believe that we should be taking steps to remove additional amounts of monetary accommodation. I believe that future removals of accommodation can likely be done in a gradual and patient manner. However, it is my view that moving sooner rather than later will make it more likely that future removals of accommodation can be done gradually—that is, reduce the likelihood that the Fed will get “behind the curve” and feel the need to remove accommodation more rapidly.\n\nIn addition, as we make further progress in removing accommodation, I believe we should be turning our attention to a discussion of how we might begin the process of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve balance sheet.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "October 24, 2018\n\nIn the September Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate to a range of 2 to 2.25 percent. In our statement announcing the decision, we ceased to include language that described the current stance of monetary policy as “accommodative.”\n\nI supported the most recent federal funds rate increase. In my recent speeches and essays, I have been arguing that the Federal Reserve should be gradually and patiently raising the federal funds rate until we get into the range of a “neutral stance.” Once we’ve reached that point, I intend to assess the outlook for the U.S. economy and look at a broad range of factors before deciding what further actions, if any, might then be appropriate.\n\nOne challenge in moving toward a neutral stance is the inherently imprecise and uncertain nature of estimating what constitutes “neutral.” This judgment is more of an art than a science and involves observing and analyzing a wide variety of factors. The uncertainty of this judgment is complicated by the fact that 2018 U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth has been substantially aided by sizable fiscal stimulus, whose impact is likely to fade somewhat in 2019 and further in 2020.\n\nThe purpose of this essay is to explore a number of the key issues associated with using the neutral rate concept in formulating monetary policy. In particular, I will discuss several of the challenges associated with estimating this rate, describe limitations on the use of this concept, and explain how it might best be used in debating and determining the appropriate path for the U.S. federal funds rate.\n\nWhat Is the Neutral Rate?\n\nThe neutral rate is the theoretical federal funds rate at which the stance of Federal Reserve monetary policy is neither accommodative nor restrictive. It is the short-term real interest rate consistent with the economy maintaining full employment with associated price stability.\n\nYou won’t find the neutral rate quoted on your computer screen or in the financial section of the newspaper. The neutral rate is an “inferred” rate—that is, it is estimated based on various analyses and observations.\n\nThis rate is not static. It is a dynamic rate that varies based on a range of economic and financial market factors. A number of economists inside as well as outside the Federal Reserve System do extensive work to model and estimate this rate. While the estimates produced by these models can differ substantially, they all typically draw on a variety of inputs which reflect, to varying degrees, prospects for U.S. economic growth, global growth and various aspects of overall financial conditions. (See the Appendix, “Modeling the Neutral Rate.”)\n\nThe neutral rate can be measured for different time horizons. Estimates of the “shorter-run” neutral rate are typically influenced by nonmonetary drivers of near-term GDP growth such as changes in current fiscal policy.\n\nEstimates of the “longer-run” neutral rate are typically influenced by nonmonetary drivers which reflect more enduring secular factors such as expected medium-term growth in the workforce and the expected rate of increase in labor productivity. Productivity growth, in turn, is influenced by investment in capital equipment and technology, regulatory policies, and policies which impact the education and skill levels of the U.S. workforce. In addition, the longer-run neutral rate is likely to be influenced by trends in the global supply and demand for safe and liquid financial assets.\n\nTo illustrate the difference between short- and long-run measures, I will use an example regarding fiscal policy. If the federal government passes a substantial tax cut or increases government spending, it may create a short-term stimulus that materially increases near-term GDP, which will likely be accompanied by an increase in the shorter-run neutral rate. However, if these policies do not fundamentally increase the medium- or longer-term growth potential of the U.S. economy, they may have only a marginal impact on the longer-run neutral rate.\n\nIn assessing the stance of monetary policy and making judgments about the future path of the federal funds rate, I prefer to focus on measures of the neutral rate that de-emphasize the impact of more volatile, shorter-run transitory factors. I tend to focus more on a range of indicators that reflect the sustainable (medium-term and longer-run) growth potential for the U.S. economy.\n\nWhy Is the Neutral Rate Important?\n\nDespite the fact that judging the level of the neutral rate is inherently uncertain and imprecise, many of us at the Federal Reserve pay close attention to the various models that seek to estimate this rate. The reason is that, despite the relatively wide confidence bands around these estimates, they can provide an indication, albeit imperfect, of whether our monetary stance is accommodative, neutral or restrictive. Making a judgment on the stance of monetary policy is a key part of my job as a central banker.\n\nMonetary policy is accommodative when the federal funds rate is below the neutral rate. When this is the case, economic slack will tend to diminish—the economy will tend to grow faster, the unemployment rate should decline and inflation should tend to rise. When the federal funds rate is above the neutral rate, monetary policy is restrictive. When this is the case, economic slack will tend to increase—economic growth will tend to slow, the unemployment rate should tend to rise and the rate of inflation should be more muted or decline. The challenge for the Federal Reserve is managing this process and getting the balance right.\n\nA good analogy is comparing this judgment to the assessment you typically make in approaching an intersection while driving your car. Should you be pressing on the accelerator, easing off the accelerator or pressing your foot on the brakes? In this analogy, being accommodative is equivalent to pressing on the accelerator; being restrictive is equivalent to stepping on the brakes. If the Federal Reserve is raising the federal funds rate in order to remove accommodation and move toward a neutral stance, this is analogous to easing your foot off the accelerator. Every driver is familiar with making these judgments even though they are inherently imprecise and uncertain—and tend to be made through “feel” by assessing a variety of factors.\n\nWhile I look at the more volatile and imprecise measures of the shorter-run neutral rate, I am hesitant to base my monetary policy judgments on these potentially transitory fluctuations. I prefer to adjust the federal funds rate in response to my assessments of economic conditions, including my outlook for inflation, in a patient and gradual manner. This approach is more consistent with greater emphasis on my estimates of the longer-run neutral rate.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, because monetary policy acts with a lag, policymakers have to make judgments on the stance and direction of policy well in advance, just as a driver has to make a decision to speed up or slow down well before reaching an intersection. When driving, if you wait too long to ease up on the accelerator, and consequently need to slam on the brakes, you risk losing control of your vehicle. Similarly, keeping monetary policy accommodative for too long can lead to creation of excesses and imbalances that can be very difficult to address—and can create a need for the Federal Reserve to play “catch-up,” which has historically increased the probability of recession. History has shown that some moderation can, in fact, increase the likelihood of extending an economic expansion.\n\nA Reality Check: Historical Trends in Global Interest Rates\n\nAs a reality check on estimates of the neutral federal funds rate, I find it very useful to look at trends in market-determined interest rates—which are not theoretical and can be observed. For example, it is worth noting that nominal yields on long-term bonds in the Group of Seven (G-7) countries—Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States—have recently touched their lowest levels in the past 150 years (Chart 1). One driver of the decline in nominal yields since the 1970s is likely a significant reduction in longer-run inflation expectations.\n\n\n\nChanges in inflation-adjusted global government bond yields should, over time, reflect changes in the longer-run neutral real rate of interest. After adjusting for inflation, the real interest rates on safe and liquid assets—primarily global government bonds of various countries—have declined significantly over the past 30 years, a decline that precedes the Great Recession. Our economists at the Dallas Fed believe that this decline in real interest rates is likely due to lower rates of trend economic growth in these various countries, at least partly as a result of demographic shifts (particularly aging populations) and lower rates of trend productivity growth.[1]\n\nAnother major factor in the downward trend in bond yields is the substantial growth in worldwide demand for safe and liquid assets arising from a considerable increase in the size of pension funds, global central bank balance sheets, and other fixed-income investment pools. When global investors look for safety and liquidity, they naturally gravitate to U.S. Treasury bonds as well as other sovereign obligations.\n\nAs financial markets have become much more globally integrated, the search for safe assets has increasingly become global. In this search, much has been made of the shortage of safe assets in which these global pools of money can be invested. The impact has been to drive down interest rates on government debt in the U.S. as well as globally. Dallas Fed economist Marc Giannoni and his research co-authors have argued that the increased demand for safety and liquidity explains a decline of more than 60 basis points in long-term real rates around the world over the past two decades.[2]\n\nIt stands to reason that, as global interest rates decline, our estimates of the neutral rate of interest have also correspondingly declined.\n\nNeutral Rate Uncertainty and the Challenge of Forecasting Productivity Growth\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I tend to view estimates of shorter-run and longer-run neutral rates as just one factor among several indicators which influence my assessment of the stance of monetary policy. I also rely on my regular conversations with a broad range of business contacts, our Federal Reserve business surveys, assessments of labor market dynamics, inflation indicators, the behavior of various financial market indicators and the shape of the yield curve in assessing overall economic conditions.\n\nIn this context, I use estimates of the neutral rate as part of an overall mosaic of indicators which help shape my overall assessments of current and future economic activity. When looking at neutral rate estimates, I am highly cognizant that there is likely to be significant disagreement between different models, and their outputs can be volatile based on changes in economic and financial conditions. I always keep in mind that these estimates are inherently uncertain and imprecise.\n\nOne reason for the uncertainty and imprecision is that potential GDP growth is a key driver of the neutral rate—and this is inherently challenging to forecast. GDP growth is comprised of growth in the labor force plus growth in the rate of productivity. I would emphasize that, while economists are reasonably proficient in estimating likely changes in labor force growth, it is far more difficult and challenging for economists to anticipate changes in the sustainable rate of improvement in productivity.\n\nIf the rate of workforce growth is likely to slow, can this be offset by improvements in productivity? Higher rates of sustained productivity growth would mean, all things being equal, a higher neutral interest rate. The uncertainty regarding future improvements in productivity creates uncertainty for estimates of the neutral rate of interest. Chart 2 illustrates the difficulty in forecasting productivity growth by comparing actual productivity growth in the U.S. versus forecasts.\n\n\n\nImplications for Monetary Policy\n\nCurrently, with the U.S. unemployment rate at approximately 3.7 percent and the headline personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rate of inflation at slightly more than 2 percent, I believe that the Federal Reserve is achieving its dual-mandate objectives.\n\nAs we reach our dual-mandate objectives, I believe that the Federal Reserve should be gradually easing off the accelerator—we no longer need to be stimulating the U.S. economy. As such, I believe we should be gradually and patiently moving toward a neutral policy stance.\n\nDue to improvements in expectations for near-term U.S. economic growth, estimates of the shorter-run neutral rate have risen over the past 12 months. However, because these shorter-run estimates are subject to great uncertainty and can be heavily influenced by near-term transitory factors, I tend to focus a bit more heavily on expectations for medium- and longer-term growth in the U.S. economy. As a consequence, estimates of the longer-run neutral rate weigh more heavily on my thinking.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, it is our expectation at the Dallas Fed that the impact of recent fiscal stimulus, which has substantially contributed to 2018 economic growth, is likely to wane somewhat in 2019 and further in 2020. At the same time that the recent stimulus begins to wane, our Dallas Fed economists believe that the rate of workforce growth, a key driver of longer-term GDP growth, is likely to slow due to aging-population demographics.\n\nA key question is whether this slowing in workforce growth will be offset by improvements in the rate of productivity growth in the U.S. How the rate of productivity growth unfolds in 2019 and 2020, and beyond, will have a significant impact on future GDP growth. Because the sustainable rate of productivity growth is inherently difficult to predict, I have been somewhat cautious in my judgments regarding the appropriate pace and ultimate level of the federal funds rate.\n\nTo help make these assessments, I carefully monitor the Treasury yield curve. This curve serves as a reality check for my outlook regarding the U.S. and global economies. As of the date of this essay, the one-year Treasury rate stands at 2.65 percent, the two-year stands at 2.88 percent and the 10-year and 30-year Treasury rates are at 3.15 percent and 3.36 percent, respectively.[3] In my opinion, the one- and two-year short-term rates are substantially reflective of communications by the Federal Reserve regarding our expectations for the path of the federal funds rate. I think those expectations are heavily priced into these shorter-term Treasury securities. While I believe the more muted rise in the 10- and 30-year Treasuries is reflective of a substantial amount of global liquidity and demand for safe assets, I also think the yield levels of these securities are consistent with more sluggish expectations for future economic growth in the U.S. and globally.\n\nI am also cognizant that the 10-year Treasury has recently moved from 2.90 percent at the beginning of September to 3.15 percent today.[4] This may reflect several factors, including greater optimism regarding the prospects for future GDP growth.\n\nEach of us around the FOMC table submits quarterly, as part of the Summary of Economic Projections (sometimes referred to as the SEP or the “dot plot”), our best judgments regarding the appropriate path for the federal funds rate and the “longer-run” federal funds rate. My longer-run rate submission is my best estimate of the longer-run neutral rate for the U.S. economy. In the September SEP, the range of submissions by FOMC participants for the longer-run rate was 2.5 to 3.5 percent, and the median estimate was 3.0 percent.\n\nMy own estimate of the longer-run neutral rate is modestly below the median of the estimates made by my colleagues. My suggested rate path for 2019 is also modestly below the 3 to 3.25 percent median of the ranges suggested by my fellow FOMC participants. My SEP estimates are consistent with my recent public statements which indicated that my base case for 2019 is to gradually and patiently raise the federal funds rate into a range of 2.5 to 2.75 percent or, more likely, into a range of 2.75 to 3 percent.\n\nOf course, my judgments regarding both the stance of monetary policy and the appropriate path of the federal funds rate are subject to change based on incoming economic and financial inputs which will either confirm or cause me to adjust my views. In particular, as we proceed along this path, I will be regularly assessing the outlook for the U.S. economy and also closely monitoring prospects for global economic growth, as well as reviewing indicators of overall financial conditions and a range of other factors in order to update my judgments regarding the appropriate pace and precise number of moves necessary to get to a neutral stance.\n\nI intend to avoid prejudging what, if any, further actions we should take once we get into the range of our best estimate of a neutral stance. I intend to make that judgment sometime in the spring or summer of 2019 based on the economic outlook at that time.\n\nConclusion\n\nMy purpose in writing this essay has been to discuss the neutral rate, explore several of the key issues surrounding this concept, and point out that it is just one aspect of assessing the stance of U.S. monetary policy. It is worth emphasizing that there are limitations to using the neutral rate concept—estimates of the neutral rate are imprecise and uncertain, as are estimates of the natural rate of unemployment, potential GDP and other theoretical concepts we utilize to judge the state of the U.S. economy. One key reason for uncertainty regarding estimates of the neutral rate is the difficulty in predicting future changes in the sustainable rate of productivity growth.\n\nDespite its inherent uncertainties, I believe that the neutral rate concept is a useful tool. However, because it has limitations, it is best used in conjunction with a broad range of other economic analyses as well as extensive conversations with private sector leaders and a focus on identifying and differentiating between cyclical and structural drivers of the U.S. and global economies.\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nModeling the Neutral Rate (r*)\n\nThere are various models in use inside and outside the Federal Reserve that produce estimates of r*. One estimate I closely monitor is produced by Federal Reserve economist Thomas Laubach and New York Fed President John Williams.[5] Another estimate is done by Dallas Fed economist Evan Koenig along with Alan Armen,[6] and yet another is produced by Dallas Fed Research Director Marc Giannoni along with Marco Del Negro, Domenico Giannone and Andrea Tambalotti (referred to as “DGGT” in Chart A-1) of the New York Fed.[7]\n\nThese models differ in terms of their structural assumptions and the data they use to produce estimates of the neutral rate. For example, Laubach–Williams uses data on real GDP, core PCE inflation, oil prices, import prices and the federal funds rate as inputs for their model. This model attempts to estimate an output gap to assess the neutral rate of interest. The Koenig model uses data on long-term bond yields, survey measures of long-term GDP growth and long-term inflation as inputs for its estimates of long-run r*. Giannoni’s model uses a broad set of key macroeconomic and financial data series to generate estimates of the neutral rate at different time horizons.[8] Chart A-1 provides a summary of the outputs of these models over the past 30 years.\n\n\n\nWhile these models produce estimates which can vary widely, they all agree that the longer-run neutral rate of interest has declined over the past several years in comparison with the period 1985–2005. Our Dallas Fed economists believe that drivers of the declines in estimates of the longer-run neutral rate include lower trend GDP growth due to relatively sluggish productivity growth and to demographics—namely, an aging population, which slows workforce growth. Increased global demand for safe, liquid assets also contributes to the decline in estimates.\n\nSeparately, our economists find that their shorter-run r* estimates now exceed their longer-run estimates (see Chart A-2 for estimates of shorter-run r*). They attribute this divergence to recent fiscal stimulus and other factors that have boosted the confidence of households and firms, leading them to borrow and invest.\n\n\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.

            "content": "August 21, 2018\n\nIn our most recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting, the committee agreed to keep the federal funds rate in a range of 1.75 to 2 percent. Our August 1 statement characterized the current stance of monetary policy as “accommodative” and described growth in economic activity and employment as “strong.”\n\nThe Dallas Fed is one of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks in the United States. The Eleventh District is composed of Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico. Texas accounts for approximately 8.8 percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) and 8.4 percent of U.S. nonfarm employment. It is the largest energy-producing state in the U.S. as well as the nation’s largest exporting state.[1] It is home to approximately 50 Fortune 500 companies and numerous industry-leading small and mid-sized firms. The characteristics of our district give the Dallas Fed unique insight into energy, trade and immigration issues as well as great insight into the regional, national and global economies.\n\nThe purpose of this essay is to discuss economic conditions in the Eleventh District and the U.S. I will also discuss the implications of this assessment for the stance of monetary policy in the U.S.\n\nEconomic Conditions\n\nTexas jobs increased at an annualized rate of approximately 3.2 percent for the first seven months of 2018. This rate of job growth is estimated to be the second-highest of any state in the nation. Dallas Fed economists expect Texas jobs to increase nearly 3 percent for the full-year 2018. This strong rate of growth is broad based geographically and across industries. While growth is highly diversified, the energy sector is adding jobs at a faster rate than any other industry. Our Texas Business Outlook Surveys lend further evidence to continued widespread and broad-based expansion.[2]\n\nThe Texas economy continues to benefit from domestic migration (as well as immigration) of people and the movement of firms to the state. Aided by this trend, the state’s economy has become increasingly diversified and its population continues to grow rapidly. The population of Texas is now approaching approximately 29 million. This population growth has been associated with faster workforce growth than in other states in the U.S., which has helped fuel the district’s very strong rate of economic growth.\n\nEnergy Industry. Due to the significant industrial diversification in the state, the energy industry now accounts for approximately 9.4 percent of Texas GDP. The state’s energy production, transmission and refining industries have expanded considerably over the past few years. Due to substantial growth in the Permian Basin, the United States is now producing approximately 10.7 million barrels of oil per day (mb/d) and is expected to produce approximately 11.2 mb/d by the end of 2018.[3] This compares with current production in Russia of approximately 11.2 mb/d and in Saudi Arabia of 10.4 mb/d.[4] Texas is the largest oil-producing state in the U.S. and accounts for a significant percentage of U.S. production growth. The state is expected to produce approximately 4.7 mb/d by year-end. As a geographic entity, Texas would be the fourth-largest oil producer in the world.[5]\n\nDallas Fed economists believe that global oil supply and demand are now in rough balance. Due to growth in global demand for oil, lack of investment in long-lived production projects over the past several years, and various production constraints (particularly pipeline capacity, worker shortages and other infrastructure challenges) in the Permian Basin as well as outages due to geopolitical issues (e.g., Iran and Venezuela), we believe that we are more likely to move to a global undersupply situation in the years ahead—with oil price risk tilted to the upside. These elements underpin our forecasts that Texas oil production, even with constraints, will grow substantially over the next several years.\n\nThe Outlook. Based on all these factors, Dallas Fed economists are optimistic about the prospects for Eleventh District growth in the short and medium term. However, worker shortages as well as U.S. trade policy, particularly regarding NAFTA, are issues that could negatively impact the outlook. Research by Dallas Fed economists indicates that the U.S. trading relationship with Mexico is substantially an “intermediate goods” relationship—part of integrated supply chain and logistics relationships that allow U.S.-domiciled companies to keep jobs in this country and increase their global competitiveness.[6] It is our view that without these trading relationships, the U.S. would likely lose market share to other countries, particularly in Asia. Based on this research, we are very hopeful that NAFTA will ultimately be modernized and that the basic elements of this trading relationship will be reaffirmed in a new NAFTA agreement.\n\nU.S. GDP is estimated to have grown at a 3.1 percent annual rate over the first half of 2018. Rising consumer spending accounted for a little less than half of this growth, and unusually strong contributions from nonresidential business investment (approximately 1.2 percentage points) and net exports (approximately 0.5 percentage points) also contributed to growth. Dallas Fed economists forecast full-year GDP growth of approximately 3 percent. Based on this forecast, we expect the headline unemployment rate to reach 3.7 percent by year-end. In addition, we expect that headline personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation will remain in the neighborhood of the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target during the remainder of 2018.\n\nThe unemployment rate currently stands at 3.9 percent. Despite job growth averaging 224,000 per month over the past three months, the unemployment rate remains the same as in April due to a strong flow of net entrants into the labor force. While our economists are hopeful that a strong labor market might continue to draw in new entrants who are currently out of the workforce, it is our base-case view that the current rate of labor force growth is unlikely to continue and that the unemployment rate will continue to decline, reaching 3.5 percent by the second quarter of 2019. In short, it is our judgment that we are in a tight labor market and are already past the level of full employment in the U.S. This tightness is likely to increasingly constrain economic growth.\n\nCurrently, the headline PCE inflation rate stands at approximately 2.2 percent for the 12 months ending June 2018. As mentioned earlier, Dallas Fed economists expect inflation to remain around the Federal Reserve’s longer-run PCE inflation target of 2 percent through the end of the year. The Dallas Fed tracks a number of measures beyond headline inflation to gauge overall inflation trends. In particular, Dallas Fed economists have developed the Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate, which is a core inflation measure that, each month, excludes the most extreme upward and downward price movements. This measure now stands at 1.9 percent, and we expect it to reach 2 percent by the end of 2018.\n\nDue to the tight labor market as well as higher input costs, it is my view that cyclical forces are creating upward pressure on inflation. However, I also believe that strong structural forces (discussed below)—particularly automation and globalization—are helping to mute the inflationary impact of these cyclical forces. These crosscurrents are worth keeping in mind as we continue to consider the appropriate stance of monetary policy.\n\nImplications for Monetary Policy\n\nBased on this forecast, it is my judgment that the Federal Reserve is meeting its full employment and price stability objectives. As such, we should be removing accommodation in a gradual manner in order to get to a neutral policy stance.\n\nThe Neutral Rate\n\nThe neutral rate of interest is the federal funds rate at which monetary policy is neither accommodative nor restrictive. It is a theoretical concept, meaning that it can’t be directly observed—it must be inferred from market and other economic data. Economists’ views on this rate are necessarily estimates and inherently uncertain. However, while theoretical, estimates of the neutral rate are critical to assessing and making decisions regarding the stance of monetary policy.\n\nMy own view, informed by the work of my colleagues Evan Koenig at the Dallas Fed [7] as well as John Williams of the New York Fed and Thomas Laubach at the Federal Reserve Board, [8] is that the longer-run neutral real rate of interest is in a broad range around 0.50 to 0.75 percent, or a nominal rate of roughly 2.50 to 2.75 percent.\n\nWith the current fed funds rate at 1.75 to 2 percent, it would take approximately three or four more federal funds rate increases of a quarter of a percent to get into the range of this estimated neutral level.\n\nAt this stage, I believe the Federal Reserve should be gradually raising the fed funds rate until we reach this neutral level. At that point, I would be inclined to step back and assess the outlook for the economy and look at a range of other factors—including the levels and shape of the Treasury yield curve—before deciding what further actions, if any, might be appropriate.\n\nBeyond 2018\n\nDallas Fed economists have consistently forecast that 2018 will be a strong year for economic growth in the U.S. Reasons include a strong consumer sector, improved prospects for business investment due to tax incentives, solid global growth and substantial fiscal stimulus due to recent tax legislation and budget agreements.\n\nMy economic team has consistently cautioned that while 2018 will be strong, economic growth is likely to moderate in 2019 and 2020 as the impact of fiscal stimulus wanes and monetary policy approaches a more neutral stance. Their view has been that potential GDP growth in the U.S. is in the range of 1.75 to 2 percent and actual real GDP growth will likely reach this level by 2020 or 2021.\n\nOur economists at the Dallas Fed believe that potential GDP growth is likely to be more muted than we have historically experienced due to the impact of four key structural drivers:\n\nThe U.S. population is aging. The median age of the population has gone from 35.3 years in 2000 to 38.0 in 2017.[9] The share of population 65 years or older has risen to 16.1 percent from 12.8 percent 10 years ago. Chart 1 shows the ongoing trend of aging population—leading to declines in labor force growth rates and contributing to slowing population growth in the U.S.\n\n\n\nGDP growth is made up of growth in the workforce plus the rate of improvement in labor productivity. If workforce growth is slowing—unless we can make up for it through improvements in labor productivity—we will see lower rates of potential GDP growth. This slower potential GDP growth is crucial because it has significant implications for future living standards in the U.S. Because the projected path of government debt to GDP is historically elevated, higher rates of growth will be needed to service and pay off this debt and meet future entitlement obligations.\n\nFurthermore, the labor force participation rate has declined from 66 percent in 2007 to approximately 63 percent today. Dallas Fed economists believe the bulk of this decline is due to aging of the workforce. In fact, we expect this trend to continue so that the labor force participation rate should decline to 61 percent over the next 10 years.[10] A declining fraction of the population participating in the workforce should lead to lower output growth.\n\nIt is my view that lagging education and skill levels in the U.S. are likely having a negative impact on productivity growth despite substantial innovations in technology and increased business investment.\n\nWhile we have witnessed very rapid technological change and improvements, productivity growth has remained sluggish. Output per worker grew on average by approximately 1.9 percent per year in the 1990s, slowed to 1.4 percent in the 2000s and has slowed further to 1.0 percent since 2010. Our hypothesis at the Dallas Fed is that advancements in technology are having a profound impact on the workforce. This, in turn, is putting a premium on education and skill levels in order to improve workforce adaptability. A case in point is the changing nature of middle-skills jobs.\n\nIf you are one of the 46 million workers in this country with a high school education or less, or have a “routine” type of middle-skills job, you are likely finding that your job is being either restructured or eliminated as a result of technology. These workers may find another job in a strong job market, but unless they have gotten retrained, they are likely to see constraints on growth in their income and productivity. This may be one reason we haven’t seen a bigger productivity-growth payoff from recent advances in technology. Productivity growth that has occurred does not appear to have benefited all workers; those workers with less education may be finding their real wages and productivity declining in a new age where skills training and educational achievement levels are increasingly critical to adapting to the job market.\n\nIt is important to recognize that various research studies highlight that skill levels and educational achievement levels of the U.S. workforce have lagged those of other developed countries for the past several years. In surveys of 29 participating Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, the U.S. ranked 20th in assessments of adult literacy and math skills.[11] In addition, according to recent OECD surveys, the U.S. ranked 24th out of 35 developed countries in measures of math, science and reading skills among 15-year-olds.[12]\n\nResearch by Eric Hanushek of Stanford University with Ludger Woessmann of the University of Munich suggests that improvements in U.S. math and science skills could translate into meaningful improvements in potential GDP growth.[13] While these efforts are likely to take years, they could have substantial potential to improve future growth and prosperity in the U.S.\n\nAt the Dallas Fed, we believe that in order to address this powerful structural driver, the U.S. must do more to improve early childhood literacy and college readiness and beef up skills training at our high schools and community colleges. These efforts are a powerful investment in improving the quality of our human capital, which is essential to higher levels of GDP growth in the U.S.\n\nPotentially unsustainable government debt growth in the U.S. is creating a fiscal tailwind in 2018 and 2019 but may turn into a headwind if the U.S. takes steps to moderate its historically high expected path of debt growth. Despite the fact that the current economic expansion is the second longest in the postwar period, U.S. government debt held by the public now stands at 75.8 percent of GDP,[14] and the present value of unfunded entitlements is estimated at approximately $54 trillion.[15] The recent tax legislation and bipartisan budget compromise legislation are likely to exacerbate these issues. As a consequence of this level of debt, the U.S. is much less likely to have the fiscal capacity to fight the next recession.\n\nFurther, high and rising levels of government debt as well as elevated levels of corporate debt mean that the U.S. economy is becoming much more interest rate sensitive. That is, increases in interest rates would likely require a higher proportion of cash flow in order to service corporate and government debt obligations. Structural reforms and other actions that flatten the path of future government debt growth may be advisable to keep this short-term-growth tailwind from becoming a medium- and longer-term headwind to economic growth in the U.S.\n\nFailing to take advantage of the opportunities of globalization is likely to lower U.S. GDP relative to potential. With less than 5 percent of the world’s population,[16] the U.S. faces growth capacity constraints and has developed integrated supply chains and logistics arrangements in this hemisphere which have helped improve U.S. competitiveness. Dallas Fed economists believe it makes sense to segment U.S. trading relationships into those which are primarily final goods versus intermediate goods. For example, our trade deficit with China is primarily final goods. Conversely, our trading relationships with Mexico and Canada are primarily intermediate goods. As mentioned earlier, intermediate-goods trading relationships are more indicative of integrated supply chain and logistics arrangements which have allowed U.S. companies to add jobs and increase their global competitiveness.\n\nIn addition, the U.S. has historically added to its workforce growth through immigration. Immigrants and their children have made up over half the workforce growth in the U.S. over the past two decades,[17] and this proportion is likely to be even higher over the next two decades, as shown in Chart 2.\n\n\n\nDallas Fed research indicates that immigration generally contributes to a larger labor force, which has benefits for economic growth.[18] Our research also indicates that high-skilled immigration has been shown to positively influence productivity growth. Nearly half of college-educated immigrants majored in science, technology, engineering or math (STEM). This far outpaces U.S.-born college-educated workers, about one quarter of whom major in STEM fields. High-skilled foreign-born workers have also been shown to patent at higher rates than native workers, largely as a result of their concentration in the STEM fields.[19] This type of innovative activity has been shown to be a key factor in U.S. productivity growth in the post-World War II period.[20]\n\nHow the U.S. navigates these globalization challenges will have critical impacts on potential GDP growth.\n\nWhere We Go from Here\n\nWhen I joined the Fed in September of 2015, the federal funds rate was 0.0 to 0.25 percent. This rate had not been adjusted since late 2008. The Fed’s balance sheet stood at approximately $4.5 trillion.\n\nSince that time, the Fed has been able to gradually remove accommodation and implement a plan to reduce the size of its balance sheet. Over this period, the unemployment rate has moved down substantially and inflation is now running at approximately 2 percent.\n\nAt this juncture, the challenge for the Fed is to raise the federal funds rate in a gradual manner calibrated to extend this expansion, but not so gradually as to get behind the curve so that we have to play catch-up and raise rates quickly. Having to raise rates quickly would likely increase the risk of recession.\n\nAs I judge the pace at which we should be raising the federal funds rate, I will be carefully watching the U.S. Treasury yield curve. Currently the one-year Treasury rate is 2.44 percent, the two-year is 2.61 percent and the 10-year is 2.87 percent.[21] My own view is that the short end of the Treasury curve is responding to Federal Reserve policy expectations. The longer end of the curve is telling me that, while there is substantial global liquidity and a search for safe assets, expectations for future growth are sluggish—and this is consistent with an expectation that U.S. growth will trend back down to potential. Overall, the shape of the curve suggests to me we are “late” in the economic cycle. I do not discount the significance of an inverted yield curve—I believe it is worth paying attention to given the high historical correlation between inversions and recession.\n\nI will also be closely monitoring global financial and economic developments and their potential impact on domestic financial and economic conditions. As global financial markets and economies have become increasingly interconnected, the potential for spillovers to the U.S. is greater than in the past. That is, global economic and financial instability has the potential to transmit to domestic financial markets, potentially leading to a tightening of financial conditions which, if prolonged, could lead to a slowing in U.S. economic activity.\n\nBased on these various factors, as well as the current strength of the U.S. economy and my outlook for economic conditions over the medium term, I believe it will be appropriate for the Fed to continue to gradually move toward a neutral monetary policy stance. I believe that this gradual approach to removing monetary policy accommodation will give us the best chance of managing against imbalances and further extending the current economic expansion in the U.S.\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.

            "content": "June 19, 2018\n\nU.S. crude oil production is estimated to have grown from 5.1 million barrels per day in May 2008 to approximately 10.6 million barrels per day in May 2018.[1], [2] As a result of this growth, the U.S. now represents approximately 13 percent of global crude oil production, up from 7 percent 10 years ago. Improvements in shale oil drilling and completion techniques have been a critical element of this growth, with much of the new production occurring in Texas as well as North Dakota, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Colorado.[3] While the U.S. continues to be a substantial crude oil importer, the shale boom has allowed our country to substantially reduce the percentage of petroleum product consumption that is supplied by imports.\n\nDallas Fed economists focus on energy market dynamics because of their implications for oil prices, which in turn, affect U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), employment and inflation. As we’ve seen in past economic cycles, changes in oil prices particularly impact consumer spending and input costs for businesses, as well as capital investment and job creation in energy-producing regions of the U.S.\n\nGiven the importance of oil to the U.S. and global economies, the Dallas Fed has assembled an experienced team of energy economists, created key industry surveys and built relationships with industry executives in order to build a deep understanding of the energy industry and global energy markets. In the fall of 2017, we created an Energy Advisory Council to more systematically build our insights into energy market trends and developments. Through these various channels, we seek to gain insights that are critical to our understanding of the impact of energy market developments on economic conditions and their implications for monetary policy in the U.S.\n\nWhile this essay focuses primarily on oil, Dallas Fed economists also focus on understanding renewable energy sources. As discussed in recent Dallas Fed publications, Wind Power a Growing Force in Oil Countryand Texas Has ‘All-of-the-Above’ Energy Approach, Texas is the nation’s largest producer of wind-generated electricity.[4] In the years ahead, we expect renewables such as wind and solar power to comprise a larger percentage of the nation’s energy mix. However, even with substantial growth in renewables, it is expected that fossil fuels will comprise approximately 77 percent of global energy use in 2040 (as estimated by the U.S. Energy Information Administration).[5]\n\nBackground\n\nDallas Fed economists believe that global oil supply and demand are now in relative balance. First quarter 2018 estimates indicate that global average oil production was approximately 98.3 million barrels per day and global consumption was approximately 98.4 million barrels per day.[6] These estimates incorporate the December 2016 agreement made by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other oil-producing countries to cut crude oil production by approximately 1.8 million barrels per day.\n\nRecently, OPEC and other oil-producing countries have discussed restoring some of this crude oil production cut. In the short run, such a restoration of production might help offset expected production outages from countries such as Venezuela and Iran. However, in the medium term, Dallas Fed economists continue to believe that, due to expected growth in daily global demand, the trend of global supply/demand is fundamentally toward balance.\n\nOil supply is substantially comprised of three main segments: crude oil, natural gas liquids and biofuels.[7] It is our view, based on Dallas Fed analysis, surveys and discussions with industry contacts, that U.S. crude oil production will grow by more than 1 million barrels per day in 2018 and exceed approximately 11.2 million barrels per day by year-end. In addition, we expect U.S. production of natural gas liquids of approximately 4.5 million barrels per day and production of biofuels of approximately 1.2 million barrels per day by year-end 2018.[8]\n\nIn terms of crude oil production, only Russia, which currently accounts for approximately 11 million barrels per day, produces more than the U.S.[9] By comparison, Saudi Arabia currently produces approximately 10 million barrels of crude oil per day, having cut approximately 0.5 million barrels per day from its crude oil production as a result of the OPEC agreement.\n\nDallas Fed economists estimate that by year-end 2018, the U.S. will consume approximately 20.6 million barrels per day of oil. Our economists believe that, over the next several years, the U.S. will continue to increase its oil production, while consumption growth is expected to flatten due to energy efficiency gains as well as greater use of natural gas and renewable energy sources to meet energy demand.\n\nGlobal oil markets face a number of uncertainties and challenges. How these issues unfold will likely have implications for energy prices as well as economic conditions and monetary policy in the U.S.\n\nKey Issues and Challenges\n\nReduction in Spending on Long-Lived Projects\nOne potential issue facing the global oil market is the recent decline in capital investment in long-lived exploration and production (E&P) projects. Historically, major oil companies have allocated substantial portions of their capital expenditure budgets to these long-lived investments. These investments have included deepwater and ultra-deepwater offshore wells,[10] Arctic drilling and oil sands production. These projects typically cost hundreds of millions to billions of dollars to complete, take several years to build and have useful lives in excess of 20 years. These projects are important to global energy markets because they fundamentally increase medium- and longer-term global oil supply.\n\nAs Chart 1 indicates, since 2014, major oil companies have reduced their capital expenditures relating to long-lived projects. As a consequence of several years of lower investment spending on these projects, the global energy market has increased its dependence on future production growth from shale oil.\n\n\n\nShale production has the benefit of being more financially manageable and operationally nimble. However, shale wells typically have very rapid production decline characteristics (discussed below). Specifically, a shale project is a much more “short-cycle” investment than a typical conventional project—it can be drilled and brought onstream very quickly and, on average, for approximately $6 million to $8 million per well. However, because of its rapid production decline features, shale requires additional and continuous investment in order to maintain production levels.\n\nChart 2 shows the growth in shale crude oil output in the U.S. Less than 10 years ago, U.S. shale produced approximately 0.5 million barrels per day, or less than 1 percent of global crude oil production.[11] In 2017, U.S. shale produced approximately 4.7 million barrels per day and made up approximately 6 percent of global crude oil production. As shale makes up an increasing percentage of global crude oil supply, the challenge will be to find ways to increase shale well productivity, overcome input shortages and ramp up production to meet incremental global demand growth.\n\n\n\nGrowth in Global Demand\nDemand for oil grew from an average of 90.4 million barrels per day in 2012 to approximately 98.4 million barrels per day in the first quarter of 2018.[12] Much of this growth has come from emerging-market economies, particularly China, India and countries in the Middle East region (see Chart 3 for analysis of global demand growth).\n\n\n\nIt is estimated that global oil demand is likely to increase from an average of 98.4 million barrels per day in the first quarter of 2018 to approximately 101.5 million barrels per day by 2020. World Bank and International Monetary Fund projections suggest that global demand growth will continue to be driven primarily by emerging-market economies.\n\nThis forecast rate of global demand growth (approximately 1.1 million to 1.5 million barrels per day) should provide a strong underpinning for global energy markets and the resulting price of oil. The challenge will be producing enough oil to meet demand growth over the next three to five years.[13]\n\nImpediments to Growth of U.S. Shale Oil Production\nWhile estimates for growth of U.S. shale vary among industry observers, our contacts believe that U.S. shale production should be sufficient to supply a substantial portion of incremental global demand growth for the next few years. However, our industry contacts are concerned about key production impediments that have the potential to limit the ability of shale to supply incremental global demand growth beyond that time frame.\n\nWhile there are a number of shale formations across the U.S., the most prolific is the Permian Basin, a geologic area rich in oil and gas that is 250 miles wide and 300 miles long across West Texas and eastern New Mexico. The Permian was responsible for approximately 63 percent of U.S. crude oil production growth in 2017, far outpacing the next-most-prolific U.S. shale formation, the Bakken in North Dakota and Montana (which accounted for approximately 18 percent of U.S. crude oil production growth).[14]\n\nIndustry contacts cite the Permian’s advantage over other areas due to its multiple layers of thick shale rock, the quality of the oil and the relatively close proximity to refiners, export terminals and pipelines. The March 2018 Dallas Fed Energy Survey indicated that the Midland Basin portion of the Permian appears to be more economically attractive than other shale formations, on average, as shown in Chart 4. However, several of our industry contacts suggest that the Delaware Basin has attractive drilling characteristics that are as compelling as the Midland Basin’s.\n\nAs West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices have remained above $60 for most of 2018, drilling outside the most attractive portions of the Permian has become more economically appealing for E&P companies. These areas include the Bakken, parts of the Eagle Ford in South Texas and most of the SCOOP/STACK in Oklahoma. If prices persist at current levels, industry contacts expect to see oil companies more aggressively expand their production activities beyond the Permian Basin.\n\n\n\nAs mentioned above, our Dallas Fed industry contacts believe that there are a number of challenges to continued robust growth in shale crude oil production in the medium term. The most significant potential challenges are described below.\n\nThe primary method for drilling wells in shale-rock formations is known as horizontal drilling—where a well is drilled vertically (averaging approximately 10,000 feet) before being guided horizontally through the rock (averaging a distance of between 5,000 and 10,000 feet). Although a highly effective method, horizontal wells often reach peak crude oil production in the first few months, with output declining rapidly thereafter, sometimes as much as 80 percent after one year. As a result, in order to grow overall crude oil production, more wells must be drilled and well productivity must be boosted substantially. While companies are drilling more wells this year to overcome this decline curve, they face constraints regarding labor, input costs, infrastructure and the return requirements of capital providers.\n\nDallas Fed industry contacts report that the oil and gas industry in the Permian Basin faces a shortage of workers. Our contacts note that industry service companies are facing higher levels of turnover as workers either leave for higher pay at competitors or leave the industry due to the highly strenuous working conditions. In addition, companies report finding it difficult to attract previously laid-off workers back to the industry. Bureau of Labor Statistics data indicate that layoffs during the oil price decline of 2014–15 resulted in an estimated loss of one-third of the workforce,[15] and industry contacts report that many workers either are reluctant to return to the industry or need significant financial and/or job security incentives to return given the boom/bust nature of the industry.\n\nWhile the oil and gas industry has become more efficient, drilling and completing wells is still a labor-intensive endeavor. The oil production sector has added more than 40,000 jobs in Texas and more than 60,000 jobs in the U.S. from December 2016 through April 2018, and high demand for workers has led to significant wage pressures. Our Dallas Fed Energy Survey shows that energy companies based in the Eleventh Federal Reserve District (which includes Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico) increased wages and benefits throughout 2017 and have been accelerating this pace in 2018.\n\nLabor shortages are particularly acute in the Permian Basin. The May 2018 unemployment rate in Midland, Texas, the heart of the Permian, was 2.2 percent.[16] Housing is also in short supply in the Permian Basin, and companies have again resorted to using temporary housing structures for their workers. House prices in Midland have risen substantially since 2016, and housing inventories are estimated at one month of supply.[17]\n\nWater and sand are key inputs used in shale production, accounting for 30 to 35 percent of the cost of drilling and completing a well.[18] Contacts report that sand costs have increased substantially during the past 12 months. Specifically, increasing volumes of sand used in well fracking are creating strains on infrastructure in the region (10,000 tons of sand per well is not uncommon, requiring 100 railcars or 400 truckloads for transport).\n\nIn addition, water availability has become more of a logistical and financial challenge. As operators pursue larger well-completion projects and often operate on multiple well pads, the need for more advanced planning to arrange for water-supply logistics is becoming a more significant challenge. Another concern is water disposal. While companies often source water used in fracking from an underground aquifer in the Permian, operators cite greater concerns regarding the disposal of wastewater that is produced as a byproduct of oil. On average, three to five barrels of water come out of the ground for every barrel of oil that is produced.[19] This water must either be transported to an approved saltwater disposal well, further straining transportation infrastructure, or recycled and used as frack water—a process that is generally considered too expensive for most operators.\n\nSeveral industry contacts and other observers have cited their concerns regarding water and air pollution, wastewater management and other issues relating to emissions of greenhouse gases. These are critical issues which state as well as federal regulatory agencies must actively monitor and are important operating considerations for firms participating in this industry. Several of our contacts, and industry observers, have discussed the critical need for proper safeguards in order to prevent degradation of water and air quality, and loss of land use.\n\nIn the Permian, oil and natural gas pipeline capacity—used to transport oil and natural gas to refineries and processing plants hundreds of miles from the well site—remains a potential problem in 2018 and 2019. Our expectation is that oil pipeline capacity will become very tight late in 2018 and early 2019, as shown in Chart 5, and possibly sooner if production surprises to the upside or pipelines and refineries experience unforeseen downtime. However, the pipeline bottlenecks should be alleviated in the second half of 2019 as new pipelines come onstream.\n\n\n\nEnergy executives report that public-market capital providers are much more focused on capital discipline from oil and gas companies. From January 2, 2017, through June 13, 2018, energy stocks increased only 1.1 percent, while the price of oil and the S&P 500 increased 35.8 percent and 24.2 percent, respectively, as shown in Chart 6.[20]\n\nAs a result of this underperformance, industry contacts report that capital providers are increasingly pressuring management teams to increase their focus on achieving higher rates of return, rather than focusing primarily on increasing overall production levels. Contacts report that this capital-discipline focus is causing many boards of directors to revise incentive structures and compensation arrangements for company management teams. It may also have the impact of encouraging some independent production companies to more proactively consider mergers and other actions that increase scale and improve operating margins.\n\n\n\nProduction Outages and Geopolitical Risks\nA large percentage of global oil production is in politically unstable areas of the world, and political and military conflict as well as governance challenges have given rise to oil supply disruptions in the past several years. These disruptions (or “supply shocks”) have the potential to cause a rise in oil prices in the short term.\n\nSome of the more significant disruptions in recent years have occurred in Venezuela, Libya and Iran. Daily Venezuelan crude oil production is estimated to have fallen by 1.1 million barrels since 2013 and is continuing to decline.[21] Libya has experienced civil strife since the fall of Gaddafi. After declining from a high of 1.6 million barrels per day in January 2011 to zero in August 2011, Libyan crude oil production moved back up to roughly 1.0 million barrels per day in May 2018. Iran has seen its crude oil production increase by approximately 0.8 million barrels per day following the removal of sanctions in 2016. However, the recent U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement has the potential to reduce Iranian exports and crude oil production.\n\nIn a global market that is in relative oil supply/demand balance, supply outages due to geopolitical events have the potential to cause sporadic episodes of spikes in oil prices.\n\nImplications for Energy Markets\n\nDallas Fed economists and our industry contacts increasingly are of the view that we have gone from a global oversupply situation (2014 to mid-2017) to one currently of relative balance (taking into account OPEC supply restrictions). Over the next few years, we believe that global oil markets will be in a “fragile equilibrium” in which demand growth should likely be met in large part by growth in U.S. shale oil production. This, of course, assumes no new material disruptions from major oil-producing countries in the Middle East or other producers such as Russia, Nigeria or Venezuela.\n\nHowever, given the current lack of investment in long-lived production projects, and assuming global oil demand continues to grow between 1.1 million and 1.5 million barrels per day,[22] we would expect future world consumption growth to be more dependent on shale production growth. Due to the potential impediments described above, there is a growing likelihood of an eventual global undersupply situation in which shale will be unable to keep up with demand growth. Industry contacts acknowledge that higher oil prices could well induce producers to find ways to overcome these potential impediments.\n\nIn particular, some industry participants are hopeful that this situation could be mitigated by continued technological innovation in shale production and increases in OPEC production, as well as greater future investment in long-lived projects such as oil sands production in Canada and offshore drilling. In general, industry contacts emphasize that higher oil prices certainly have the potential to make these mitigants more likely to occur.\n\nOverall, given our forecast and the potential impediments to substantial growth in shale oil production, we believe global oil markets are likely to be more vulnerable in the medium term to geopolitical shocks and disruptions that would create a potential for price risk to the upside.\n\nA More Muted Impact of Higher Oil Prices on the U.S. Economy\nIncreases in oil prices can be caused by higher-than-expected demand (so-called “demand shocks”) from a stronger global economy or from unexpected reductions in supply (so-called “supply shocks”), such as those resulting from certain types of geopolitical events. Today, Dallas Fed economists believe that the recent run-up in oil prices is due to a combination of both demand and supply factors.\n\nHistorically, recessions in the U.S. have often followed oil price shocks. Higher oil prices tend to increase costs to consumers, which can, in turn, reduce their disposable income and consumption of non-oil goods and services. For example, Dallas Fed analysis indicates that every dollar increase in the oil price leads to a 2.4 cent increase in gasoline prices—all other factors staying the same—which over the course of a year would amount to approximately $3.4 billion in additional expenditures on gasoline.[23] Oil price increases also tend to cause firms to experience higher energy, shipping and input costs.\n\nOver time, several factors have mitigated the impact of higher oil prices on the U.S. economy. The emergence of U.S. shale is one factor, as increased domestic production means that a larger share of the economy is helped by higher oil prices. Reduced crude oil imports also benefit our trade balance.\n\nFinally, as shown in Chart 7, the U.S. economy is less oil-intensive than in the past due to substitution for oil by other forms of energy, improved fuel efficiency and growth in the less-energy-intensive services sector as a share of the overall economy. For example, in 1970, the U.S. consumed 1.1 barrels of oil for every $1,000 of GDP; by 2017, only 0.4 barrels of oil were consumed for every $1,000 of GDP.[24]\n\nBased on these various factors, it is the view of Dallas Fed economists that the negative impact of higher oil prices on GDP growth is likely to be more muted than in the past. It is our view that a 10 percent increase in the oil price should have a relatively modest negative impact on U.S. GDP growth.[25] This negative impact should further diminish as the U.S. continues to grow its domestic oil production.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Evolving Oil Market Dynamics\n\nThe purpose of this essay has been to lay out the key factors the Dallas Fed closely tracks in analyzing the global energy markets and in considering the impact of oil prices on economic conditions in the U.S. Like any dynamic market, the oil market can be unpredictable, and key elements are often shifting, which can have profound impacts on global supply and demand. Given the importance of oil to the U.S. and global economies, our Dallas Fed research team is highly focused on understanding these market dynamics and determining their implications for GDP, unemployment and inflation in the U.S.\n\nAs discussed in this essay, Dallas Fed economists believe that the global oil market is now in relative supply/demand balance. Based on various factors discussed, it is our judgment that this market is likely in the years ahead to be more vulnerable to geopolitical events and other dynamics that could create price risks to the upside. As these dynamics unfold, we will continue to work with our industry contacts to better understand the oil market and its implications for monetary policy in the U.S.\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI would like to acknowledge the contributions of Tyler Atkinson, Jim Dolmas, Soojin Jo, Evan Koenig, Marc Giannoni, Kunal Patel, Michael Plante, William Simmons, Martin Stuermer, Kathy Thacker, Joe Tracy and Mine Yücel in preparing these remarks.

            "content": "April 16, 2018\n\nTurn on the television or pick up a newspaper and you’ll likely see a discussion of what’s happening now—the latest scandal, current geopolitical developments, stock market movements, the latest GDP numbers or corporate earnings announcements. This focus on the here and now is so ingrained that we may not be aware of the short-term nature of the news flow. In the midst of this, it is sometimes easy to lose focus on the fact that short-term events often occur as a result of more persistent underlying forces that can take many years to unfold.\n\nWhat does all this have to do with the work of a central banker? I spend a good part of my time trying to understand economic conditions and make sound monetary policy decisions based on my analysis of those conditions. In this job, I am keenly aware that short-term cyclical developments are only part of the story in understanding the U.S. and global economies.\n\nThe U.S. economy has historically moved in cycles. That is, it typically behaves in patterns that tend to be, with variations, repeating. There are stretches of time when GDP grows, and these tend to be followed by periods of GDP decline, followed eventually by a return to growth, followed again by a period of decline, and so on. These cycles often repeat themselves although the exact length, magnitude and character of the pattern varies based on a variety of underlying factors.\n\nEconomists use models and other analytical techniques to assess and attempt to forecast the performance of the economy in these cycles. Based on these models, economists look for markers and other data that indicate where we are in the cycle as well as the strength and character of the economy’s performance. GDP, unemployment, various gauges of manufacturing and service sector activity, and inflation measures are examples of economic indicators that are regularly monitored. These measures are widely reported and tend to fluctuate based on factors such as industry developments, commodity prices, market developments, global developments as well as monetary and fiscal policies, and the stage of the current economic cycle.\n\nIn contrast to cyclical events, longer-term secular trends are usually not discussed on the evening news. They are much slower moving underlying trends that usually develop over an extended period of time. They may not be visible or widely reported and can take years to unfold. Examples could include demographic and migration trends, changes in consumer and industry behaviors due to automation and labor-saving technologies, and elements of global economic integration and development.\n\nIn my experience, while cyclical fluctuations often attract our attention, the underlying secular trends usually help explain these shorter-term developments. Underlying structural forces may not capture the headlines because they are slower moving and may not have a material impact for several years. However, these forces are ultimately enormously powerful.\n\nThe purpose of this essay is to first discuss the shorter-term cyclical aspects of the U.S. economy and then focus on the longer-term structural trends. In my judgment, it is critical that we more fully understand and address these secular trends if we are to have a more prosperous economic future.\n\nDallas Fed economists expect U.S. GDP growth of 2.5 to 2.75 percent in 2018. This growth is underpinned by a strong household sector, improved business investment and stronger growth outlook outside the U.S.\n\nBased on this forecast, Dallas Fed economists expect unemployment to dip from 4.1 percent to approximately 3.7 percent during the year. We also expect other measures of labor force slack to tighten. In particular, we focus on U-6, which comprises the unemployed, plus “marginally attached workers” (workers who indicate that they would like a job but have stopped looking for one), plus people who are working part time who would prefer to work full time. This measure now stands at 8.0 percent, near its prerecession low, and we expect it to improve further during 2018. We also consider estimates of the numbers of disabled workers, previously incarcerated individuals as well as other sources of available workers who could potentially return to the workforce in a strengthening job market.\n\nBased on their analysis of the labor market, our economists continue to believe that, while improvements can be made in increasing employment, we are likely at or already past “full employment” in the U.S. Dallas Fed surveys suggest that businesses are increasingly struggling to find workers to fill low- and middle-skills positions. For example, in one of our recent surveys, 61 percent of Texas small-business respondents suggested they are unable to find workers to fill these types of positions.[1] Due to this labor force tightness, it is our view that cyclical wage pressures should build during 2018.\n\nRegarding inflation, we believe that cyclical inflationary pressures are building. However, our economists also believe that these forces are being at least partially offset by the impacts of automation and, to a lesser extent, globalization. Discussions with our business contacts continue to indicate that, due to the impact of automation and business model disruption, pricing power of businesses is more limited than we’re historically accustomed to seeing at this stage in an economic expansion.\n\nWhile we expect GDP growth to be strong in 2018, we also expect that this growth will moderate in 2019 and 2020. In fact, Dallas Fed economists are forecasting GDP growth of less than 2 percent in 2020 as the short-term stimulus of the recent tax legislation and budget agreement begin to fade and monetary policy and financial conditions become less accommodative.\n\nWhile the near-term cyclical outlook is solid, underlying structural trends are more concerning. I make a point of discussing secular trends in every speech because, as policymakers, if we focus on them, we can impact how they will unfold over the medium and longer term. If we pay insufficient attention to these issues, we may find that they ultimately overwhelm shorter-term cyclical factors and lead to less growth and prosperity in the U.S. economy. I will discuss four overarching secular trends.\n\nDemographics\n\nThe U.S. population is aging. In fact, the median age of the population has gone from 35.3 years in 2000 to 37.9 in 2016.[2] The share of population 65 years or older has risen to 15.7 percent from 12.6 percent 10 years ago.[3] Chart 1 shows the ongoing trend of aging demographics—leading to declines in labor force and population growth in the U.S.\n\n\n\nGDP growth is made up of growth in the workforce plus the rate of improvement in labor productivity. If workforce growth is slowing, unless we can make up for it through more rapid improvement in labor productivity, we will see lower rates of GDP growth. This slower GDP growth is crucial because it has significant implications for future living standards in the U.S. Because government debt to GDP is historically elevated, growth will be needed to service and pay off this debt and meet future entitlement obligations.\n\nThe labor force participation rate has declined from 66 percent in 2007 to approximately 63 percent today. Dallas Fed economists believe the bulk of this decline is due to aging of the workforce. In fact, we expect this trend to continue so that the labor force participation rate should decline to 61 percent over the next 10 years.[4]\n\nThis demographic challenge is occurring, to varying degrees, across most advanced economies. For example, Germany and Japan have more challenging demographic trends than the U.S.[5]\n\nWhat can we do about this demographic challenge? First, we could implement programs and policies that encourage higher birth rates among our population. This could help address workforce growth 25 years from now. We can adopt policies that encourage people not in the workforce to join the workforce; these policies could include improved child care, better transportation services for at-risk populations, and incentives for discouraged workers to rejoin the workforce. Another supplement to workforce growth is immigration. Immigrants and their children have made up over half the workforce growth in the U.S. over the past 20 years, and this proportion is likely to be even higher over the next 20 years. (See Appendix for a further discussion of the role of immigration in the economy.)\n\nTechnology-Enabled Disruption and Its Implications for Educational Achievement and the Skills Gap\n\nWorkers are increasingly being replaced by automation. Consumers are increasingly able to use technology to shop for goods and services. Business models are being disrupted by new approaches to delivering goods and services at lower prices and potentially better convenience. As a result, business pricing power is increasingly being challenged. In response, businesses are investing more in technology and merging with other companies to achieve greater scale in order to protect gross profit margins. These trends appear to be accelerating globally.[6]\n\nDespite rapid technological change, productivity growth has remained sluggish. Output per worker grew on average by approximately 1.9 percent per year in the 1990s, slowed to 1.3 percent in the 2000s and has slowed further to 1.0 percent since 2010. One explanation may be that technology is having a profound impact on the workforce. In particular, it is changing the nature of middle-skills jobs.\n\nIf you are one of the 46 million workers in this country with a high school education or less, or have a “routine” type of middle-skills job, you are likely finding that your job is being either restructured or eliminated as a result of technology. These workers may find another job in a strong job market, but unless they have gotten retrained, they are likely to see their incomes and productivity decline. This may be one reason that we haven’t seen a bigger productivity-growth payoff from recent advances in technology. We measure productivity growth workforce-wide rather than by company or industry. While most industries are materially improving their productivity, workers with less education may be finding their real wages and productivity declining in a new age where skills training and educational achievement levels are increasingly critical to adapting to the job market.\n\nRegarding education, the U.S. is a leader in many areas versus the rest of the world. Unfortunately, several studies suggest that the skill levels and educational achievement levels of our workforce have lagged other developed countries for the last several years. In surveys of 29 participating Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, the U.S. ranked 20th in assessments of adult literacy and math skills.[7] In addition, according to recent OECD surveys, the U.S. ranks 24th out of 35 developed countries in measures of math, science and reading skills among 15-year-olds.[8]\n\nResearch by Eric Hanushek of Stanford University with Ludger Woessmann of the University of Munich suggests that improvements in U.S. math and science skills could translate into meaningful improvements in potential GDP growth.[9] While these efforts are likely to take years, they could have substantial potential to improve future growth and prosperity in the U.S.\n\nIn order to address this powerful structural driver, the U.S. must do more to improve early childhood literacy and college readiness, and do more to strengthen skills training at our high schools and community colleges.\n\nThe Potentially Unsustainable Path of Government Debt to GDP\n\nU.S. government debt held by the public now stands at 75 percent of GDP,[10] and the present value of unfunded entitlements is estimated at approximately $49 trillion.[11] The recent tax legislation and bipartisan budget compromise legislation are likely to exacerbate these issues. While increasing the level of debt to GDP is a stimulus to economic growth in the short run, that stimulus can turn into a growth headwind when the government takes steps to moderate debt growth, as it certainly must consider doing in the years ahead. As a consequence of this level of debt, the U.S. is much less likely to have fiscal capacity to fight the next recession.\n\nFurther, due to this level of government debt as well as historically high levels of corporate debt as a percentage of GDP, the economy is becoming much more interest rate sensitive. That is, increases in interest rates have greater potential to require a higher proportion of cash flow in order to service corporate and government debt obligations. Structural reforms and other actions that flatten the path of future government debt growth may be advisable at this stage of the economic cycle.\n\nGlobalization\n\nWorld economies and financial markets are increasingly integrated and interconnected. This trend is not new, but it certainly has been intensifying over the past many years. Companies increasingly think about their labor force and capital investment decisions in a global manner. Investors increasingly think globally about where to allocate capital. This helps explain why lower labor costs in one country can have an impact on inflation and labor market developments in other countries and it also helps explain why interest rate levels, stock market valuations and occasional market turmoil in one country can ripple through currencies and global markets very rapidly.\n\nTrade is certainly part of this globalization trend. With the World Trade Organization, North American Free Trade Agreement and other trade agreements, global trade has increased. In many cases, this increase in trade, along with technological advances, has been good for the U.S. in terms of consumer benefits and improving corporate efficiency and profits, but, at the same time, it has led to painful job disruption and dislocations in many cities and towns in our nation.\n\nToday, a new trend has emerged which is likely surpassing globalization in terms of job disruption—technology-enabled disruption (described above). That is, if your job is being disrupted today, it is far more likely due to technology-enabled disruption rather than globalization.\n\nDallas Fed economists believe it makes sense to segment U.S. trading relationships into those which are primarily final goods versus intermediate goods. For example, our trade deficit with China is primarily final goods. Conversely, our trading relationship with Mexico and Canada are primarily intermediate goods. Intermediate goods trading relationships are more indicative of integrated supply chain and logistics arrangements. Dallas Fed research indicates that intermediate goods relationships have allowed U.S. companies to add jobs and increase their global competitiveness.\n\nIn this regard, Dallas Fed economists believe that, at this stage in our history, globalization is more likely an opportunity for the U.S. to grow as opposed to a “threat.” With less than 5 percent of the world’s population, we believe that trade is critical to future growth in the U.S. Emerging markets and other growing economies are increasingly important sources of demand for U.S. goods and services.\n\nIt is critical that we accurately diagnose globalization and untangle it from the impacts of technology-enabled disruption. Dallas Fed economists believe that updating and modernizing trade agreements is highly appropriate, but our research also indicates that trade is a critical opportunity for the U.S. to grow faster and improve the future prosperity of our nation.\n\nPopular press and current national discussions tend to focus heavily on shorter-term cyclical developments. Because the near-term outlook for GDP growth is positive, this may lull observers into believing we are on a path to sustained improvement in the economic performance of the U.S. economy. This belief may well distract policymakers and the public from focusing on the powerful structural trends that are likely to create challenges for growth in the medium and longer term.\n\nLeadership is required to take a longer-term view and take steps to create a better economic future for our children and grandchildren. The Dallas Fed forecasts that 2018 will be a solid year for economic growth in the U.S. However, unless our nation initiates structural reforms that improve workforce growth, education and skill levels of our labor force, moderate the expected path of government debt growth, and adopts policies that allow us to capture the opportunities provided by globalization, we are likely to see sluggish rates of GDP growth in the medium and longer term.\n\nDallas Fed research indicates that immigration has been a key element of economic growth in the U.S. However, immigration is not a purely economic issue—which is why it is a highly sensitive and controversial subject. The purpose of this note is to discuss the economic aspects of immigration as a key element in growing the workforce and to explore alternative immigration policies. This discussion is particularly important today in light of the aging U.S. workforce.\n\nImmigrants and their children have made up more than 50 percent of working-age population growth in the U.S. over the past 20 years.[12] As shown in Chart A-1, we expect immigrants and their children to make up an even larger share of working-age population growth over the next 20 years as the retirement of baby boomers leads to a net decline in the working-age population of native-born workers.\n\n\n\nAlthough immigration is becoming increasingly important to workforce growth, immigration flows to the U.S. have slowed over the past 10 years. The biggest declines have been in unauthorized immigration, in part, due to housing market declines as a result of the Great Recession (which led to a decline in residential construction work opportunities) as well as more stringent enforcement policies along the Southwest border and in the U.S. interior. Improved economic conditions and falling population growth in Mexico have also played a role in dampening migration to the U.S.\n\nTemporary worker visas have recently increased, as has the flow of new legal permanent residents. Tighter labor markets are likely playing a role in boosting the demand for hiring foreign-born workers, and there is some evidence that this demand can be channeled through legal means. See Chart A-2 for measures of immigration.\n\n\n\nImmigration generally contributes to a larger labor force, which has benefits for economic growth, but high-skilled immigration has also been shown to positively influence productivity growth. Chart A-3 shows that nearly half of college-educated immigrants majored in science, technology, engineering or math (STEM). This far outpaces U.S.-born college-educated workers, about one quarter of which major in STEM fields. High-skilled foreign-born workers have also been shown to patent at higher rates than native workers, largely as a result of their concentration in the STEM fields.[13] This type of innovative activity has been shown to be a key factor in U.S. productivity growth in the post-World War II period.[14]\n\n\n\nImpact of Immigration on Native Workers\n\nDoes immigration adversely affect the working conditions of native workers? Pia Orrenius, a senior economist at the Dallas Fed, finds very little empirical evidence that immigrants create adverse wage effects among high-skilled workers, while wage and employment effects on low-skilled workers tend to be small.[15] Based on her research with Madeline Zavodny, she has also advocated for greater focus in the U.S. on employment- and merit-based immigration—which tends to bring in higher skilled workers than family-based immigration policies. They argue that demand for low-skilled immigration can be met through a temporary-worker program and that this is preferable to relying on illegal immigration, which has historically tended to be the case.[16]\n\nWhile immigration is a politically sensitive topic, Dallas Fed research indicates that, due to aging demographic trends, we need to come to grips with immigration reform in order to supplement labor force growth in the U.S.[17] These reforms could encourage greater emphasis on employer-based and skills-based immigration. Whatever the decisions made by policymakers, this discussion is important to creating greater GDP growth in the U.S.\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI would like to acknowledge the contributions of Tyler Atkinson, Jim Dolmas, Marc Giannoni, Evan Koenig, Pia Orrenius, William Simmons and Mark Wynne in preparing these remarks.",

            "content": "February 21, 2018\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in its January meeting decided to leave the federal funds rate unchanged in a range of 125 to 150 basis points. In our FOMC statement after the meeting, the committee explained that it expects “economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate.” The purpose of this essay is to briefly discuss my views regarding economic conditions, the implications for monetary policy and address a few of the fundamental challenges facing the U.S. economy.\n\nEconomic Conditions\n\nThe Dallas Fed expects that U.S. GDP will grow at approximately 2.5 to 2.75 percent in 2018. We believe that consumer spending will be strong, owing to a healthy jobs market and the multiyear improvement in household balance sheets. We also expect business investment to be stronger than in 2017, and we believe that improved global growth could also help support economic growth in the U.S.\n\nOur forecast reflects the positive near-term impact of the recent tax legislation. It is our view that the bulk of this impact will be felt in 2018 and to a lesser extent in 2019 and 2020.\n\nBased on our forecast, we expect U.S. labor market conditions to tighten this year. We forecast that headline unemployment will decline from 4.1 percent to approximately 3.6 percent by year end. We also expect U-6—a measure of labor slack that tracks the number of unemployed plus “marginally attached workers” (workers who indicate that they would like a job but have stopped looking for one) plus those working part time for economic reasons—to decline from 8.2 percent to well below 8 percent. It is the judgment of Dallas Fed economists that current levels of headline unemployment as well as U-6 are indicative of an economy that is either at or has moved past the level of full employment.\n\nOur economists expect cyclical inflation pressures to build during 2018. While these pressures will likely be at least partially offset by the impact of technology-enabled disruption (see Appendix A), I believe the headline rate of inflation is likely to firm during the year, and we are likely to make progress toward reaching the Fed’s 2 percent longer-run inflation target. I also believe we’ll see firming in the Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean measure of core inflation, which excludes extreme price movements (both high and low) in goods and services. This measure continues to be the Dallas Fed’s preferred gauge of underlying inflation in the U.S.\n\nImplications for Monetary Policy\n\nBased on these expectations, I believe the Federal Reserve should be gradually and patiently raising the federal funds rate during 2018. While my views on the appropriate path of policy will be impacted by economic conditions as they unfold during the year, I continue to believe that gradual and patient removals of accommodation will increase the likelihood of extending the economic expansion in the U.S.\n\nHistory suggests that if the Fed waits too long to remove accommodation at this stage in the economic cycle, excesses and imbalances begin to build, and the Fed ultimately has to play catch-up. In my judgment, getting behind the curve and then trying to catch up would increase the likelihood of recession in the U.S.\n\nChallenges Facing the U.S. Economy\n\nWhile Dallas Fed economists forecast strong economic growth in 2018, they also expect growth to moderate to 1.75 to 2 percent by 2020. In addition, our view is that “potential” GDP growth, the sustainable underlying growth capability of the U.S. economy, is approximately 1.75 percent. This level of potential GDP growth is lower than we’ve historically been accustomed due to several structural issues discussed below. Dallas Fed economists believe that the current level of growth above potential is due to accommodative monetary policy as well as recent fiscal stimulus. As the impact of this stimulation wanes, we expect U.S. GDP growth to trend back toward potential.\n\nWhy is potential GDP growth lower than we have historically been accustomed? Specifically, why are current assessments of potential GDP growth materially lower than during the 1990s and early 2000s? What has changed?\n\nThere are a few key structural drivers that are impacting prospects for medium-term economic growth in the U.S. How we manage and adapt to these structural challenges will fundamentally impact prospects for future growth and prosperity in the U.S.\n\nGDP growth is composed of growth in the workforce plus growth in labor productivity. Due to the aging of our population, workforce growth in the U.S. is slowing and is likely to continue slowing. The labor force participation rate has declined from 66 percent in 2007 to approximately 63 percent today. Dallas Fed economists believe that the bulk of this decline is due to aging of the workforce. Unfortunately, our economists believe that these demographic trends will cause the labor force participation rate to decline to below 61 percent over the next 10 years.\n\nPossible remedies to the effects of aging demographics could include incentives for workers to work later in their careers, inducing discouraged workers to return to the workforce and/or other measures that could help improve the rate of workforce growth in the U.S.\n\nIn addition, immigration has historically been an important element of our nation’s workforce growth. Based on published data, our Dallas Fed economists estimate that immigrants and their children have comprised over half of the workforce growth in the U.S. over the last 20 years and expect this group to comprise an even higher percentage over the next 20 years.[1]\n\nOur economists have done extensive research regarding U.S. immigration as well as the immigration policies of other countries. This research indicates that it would be appropriate for the U.S. to consider reforms to the current immigration system to more heavily take into account immigrant skills as well as other employment-based criteria. Such reforms could help enhance the economic and societal benefits from immigration.[2] Whatever policy decisions are made, it is clear that the resolution of current debates relating to immigration policy has the potential to either supplement or create headwinds for future workforce growth in the U.S.\n\nOne potential offset to these demographic trends could be improvements in labor productivity. Labor productivity is a key driver of GDP growth. However, average growth in labor productivity over the past decade has been sluggish at approximately 1.1 percent per year.[3] Labor productivity growth averaged approximately 2 percent from 1977 through 2007. While Dallas Fed economists are hopeful that increased capital spending could help improve labor force productivity, they also observe that technological progress may not contribute to productivity growth as much as it once did. One reason for this sluggishness may be lagging skills and educational achievement levels of the U.S. workforce.\n\nThe U.S. is a leader in many areas versus the rest of the world. Unfortunately, several studies suggest that skill levels and educational achievement levels of our workforce have lagged other developed countries for the last several years. According to recent Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) surveys, the U.S. ranks 24th out of 35 developed countries in measures of math, science and reading skills among 15-year-olds.[4] In addition, in surveys of 29 participating OECD countries, the U.S. ranked 20th in assessments of adult literacy and math skills.[5]\n\nResearch by Eric Hanushek of Stanford University with Ludger Woessmann of the University of Munich suggests that improvements in U.S. math and science skills could translate into meaningful improvements in potential GDP growth in the U.S.[6] While these efforts are likely to take years, they could have substantial potential to improve future growth and prosperity in the U.S.\n\nIn addition, in the most recent National Federation of Independent Business small-business survey, 49 percent of respondents said they were unable to find qualified workers to fill open positions.[7] Similarly, respondents to Dallas Fed surveys report that they are unable to find workers with adequate technical, organizational and other basic skills to fill open positions.\n\nKansas City Fed economists estimate that approximately 43 percent of all jobs in the U.S. are so-called “middle-skills” positions.[8] These include pipe fitters, automotive technicians, registered nurses, IT specialists and so on. Every one of these jobs that goes unfilled means a lost opportunity for higher GDP. These positions require more than a high school education. Due to technology-enabled disruption, the training levels for these middle-skills positions have intensified over the last several years. In order to train these workers, local junior colleges and high schools must work with local businesses to provide training opportunities in order to close this “skills gap.”\n\nThere are approximately 46 million members of the labor force in this country with a high school education or less.[9] It is our view at the Dallas Fed that, due to technology-enabled disruption, these workers are increasingly finding that their jobs are being restructured or eliminated. Unless they have sufficient levels of math and reading capability and/or are retrained, these workers are likely to struggle to adapt to the changing nature of the job market. As a result, they are likely to see their incomes and productivity decline.\n\nImproving math, reading and science capabilities, improving college readiness and beefing up the availability of skills training for potential workers will likely be essential to improving our workforce productivity, reducing the number of discouraged workers and contributing to higher GDP growth in the U.S.\n\nWhen assessing the level of debt in the economy, Dallas Fed economists look at debt held by the household sector, the business sector and the U.S. government. Since the Great Recession, the household sector in the U.S. has substantially deleveraged. The financial health of the household sector is crucial because the consumer comprises approximately 70 percent of GDP. In 2008, the household sector was historically highly leveraged relative to their incomes. It was not as apparent because household assets, particularly home prices, were elevated and appeared to support higher leverage. While consumer leverage helped fuel GDP growth leading up to 2007, in 2008, it became apparent that the consumer had to deleverage. It has taken several years—along with an improving job market—for the consumer to reduce debt relative to their income. Today's healthy consumer provides a key underpinning to the U.S. economy.\n\nUnfortunately, while the U.S. consumer has deleveraged since the Great Recession, business debt as a percentage of GDP has increased, and U.S. government debt levels have increased substantially. While increased business debt is likely manageable, U.S. government debt held by the public is now 75 percent of GDP,[10] and the present value of underfunded entitlements is now approximately $49 trillion.[11] There is a legitimate concern that the projected path of U.S. government debt relative to GDP is unlikely to be sustainable.\n\nThe corporate tax reform elements of recent tax legislation should help to encourage greater business formation and investment, which should lead to greater productivity and some increase in the growth potential of the U.S. economy. However, the debt-financed tax cuts included in the legislation are likely to temporarily stimulate demand, with effects that will peak in 2018, and gradually fade in 2019 and 2020. Ultimately, we believe that growth will return back to trend. Dallas Fed economists believe that the expected near-term boost to GDP needs to be balanced with the concern that debt to GDP is likely to materially increase in the years ahead. This projected increase in government debt to GDP comes at a point in the economic cycle when it would be preferable to be moderating the rate of debt growth at the government level.\n\nWhile leverage can stimulate the economy as it is being added, deleveraging is likely to be depressing to GDP growth. At a minimum, higher government leverage will make it less likely that fiscal policy will be a realistically available tool during the next recession. While addressing this issue involves difficult political considerations and policy choices, the U.S. may need to more actively consider policy actions that would moderate the path of projected U.S. government debt growth.\n\nConclusion\n\nDallas Fed economists are optimistic about economic prospects for 2018. We expect progress this year on our dual mandate of full employment and price stability.\n\nDespite this optimism, we believe longer-term challenges remain. These challenges present opportunities for the U.S. to take action and adopt policies that could improve sustainable economic growth and prosperity. Addressing these challenges is likely to require fundamental structural reforms and a broader menu of policy actions beyond monetary policy.\n\nA Background Note on Technology-Enabled Disruption and Its Implications\n\nAs I have been discussing for the past two years, technology-enabled disruption means workers increasingly being replaced by technology. It also means that existing business models are being supplanted by new models, often technology-enabled, for more efficiently selling or distributing goods and services. In addition, consumers are increasingly being able to use technology to shop for goods and services at lower prices with greater convenience—having the impact of reducing the pricing power of businesses which has, in turn, caused them to further intensify their focus on creating greater operational efficiencies. These trends appear to be accelerating.\n\nIt is likely that disruption is a factor in economic outcomes being increasingly skewed by educational attainment levels of workers. That is, for those who have a college degree, the unemployment rate stands at 2.1 percent, and the labor force participation rate is 73.4 percent. If you have some college education, the unemployment rate is 3.4 percent and participation rate is 66.0 percent; a high school diploma, the unemployment rate is 4.5 percent and participation rate is 57.5 percent; and some high school education, the unemployment rate is 5.4 percent and participation rate is 44.8 percent.[12]\n\nIncreasingly, workers with lower levels of educational attainment are seeing their jobs restructured or eliminated. Unless they have sufficient math and literacy skills or are retrained, these workers may likely see their productivity and incomes decline as a result of disruption. This may help explain the muted levels of wage gains and overall labor productivity growth we see in the U.S. as well as other advanced economies.\n\nThe impact of technology-enabled disruption on the workforce is likely less susceptible to monetary policy—addressing this challenge requires structural reforms. The reforms could include actions which would be aimed at improving early childhood literacy and improving math, reading and science achievement levels among high school students. These efforts could help boost overall college readiness in order to increase the percentage of students who graduate college in six years or less—now estimated at 59 percent in the U.S.[13] As mentioned in this essay, addressing the impacts of technology-enabled disruption will also require stepped up efforts to increase middle-skills training in cities across the U.S. in order to improve employment, close the skills gap (not enough workers to fill skilled jobs) and raise worker productivity. These initiatives could improve educational achievement levels in order to help our citizens better thrive in a world that increasingly demands greater education, training and adaptability.\n\nDisruption may also help explain why companies, facing one or more disruptive competitors, have been more cautious about making capacity-expansion decisions as well as investing in major capital projects. The recent tax legislation may help create incentives to improve the level of capital investment.\n\nTo deal with disruptive changes and lack of pricing power, many companies are seeking to achieve greater scale economies in order to maintain or improve profit margins. This may help explain the record level of merger and acquisition activity globally over the past few years.\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI would like to acknowledge the contributions of Tyler Atkinson, Jim Dolmas, John Duca, James Hoard, Marc Giannoni, Evan Koenig, Alex Musatov, Pia Orrenius, William Simmons, Elizabeth Sobel Blum and Dianne Tunnell in preparing these remarks.",

            "content": "October 10, 2019\n\nIn the September Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to a range of 1.75 to 2 percent. I supported this rate cut as well as the previous rate cut in July.\n\nIn addition, since mid-September, the New York Fed has announced a series of overnight and term repurchase agreement (repo) operations intended to provide additional liquidity to the overnight and term lending markets in order to maintain the federal funds rate within the target range. In the post-FOMC meeting press conference, Chairman Powell suggested that the Fed will consider additional actions in order to provide sufficient reserves consistent with our decision to implement policy in an ample-reserves regime. I do not plan to comment extensively on additional options, as we continue to debate and discuss them, other than to emphasize that I support more-permanent steps to ensure the proper functioning of repo and other short-term funding markets. I am also supportive of taking steps to adjust the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet in order to help achieve our objective of implementing policy in an ample-reserves regime.\n\nIn this essay, I will briefly review economic conditions in the U.S. I will then step back and discuss several key structural drivers that I believe are critical to the prospects for economic growth in the U.S. Finally, I will outline my current thinking regarding the stance of U.S. monetary policy.\n\nDallas Fed economists forecast growth for 2019 of approximately 2.1 percent. This forecast is based on estimated first-half growth of approximately 2.5 percent and an expectation for second-half growth of approximately 1.7 percent. This compares with a 2.5 percent rate of growth achieved in 2018.[1]\n\nDallas Fed economists had predicted some of the recent slowing due to the expected waning of the impact of fiscal stimulus. However, some of the slowing is also due to heightened trade tensions, which have contributed, at least in part, to decelerating rates of global growth as well as weakness in manufacturing and business direct investment in the U.S. Despite these headwinds, U.S. growth has been resilient primarily due to the strength of consumer spending, which accounts for approximately 70 percent of the U.S. economy. The consumer is bolstered, in particular, by a strong jobs market as well as improvements in the level of household debt to gross domestic product (GDP) which have occurred since 2008.[2]\n\nOn October 4, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported September jobs growth of 136,000. The current rate of unemployment is now approximately 3.5 percent.[3] This is the lowest level of U.S. unemployment in the past 50 years. To further gauge labor market slack, Dallas Fed economists also look at the U-6 measure of unemployment, which includes people who are unemployed, plus discouraged workers, plus workers who are working part time but would prefer to work full time. This measure now stands at approximately 6.9 percent,[4] below its prerecession low of 7.9 percent (reached in December 2006) and only slightly above its historical low of 6.8 percent (reached in October 2000).[5] These measures, as well as our Eleventh District surveys of employers and discussions with contacts, indicate that the U.S. economy is at or past the level of full employment. Many of our contacts report particular difficulty in hiring and retaining lower-skilled workers (who earn wages in a range of 12 to 15 dollars per hour), as well as finding and retaining more skilled workers, who typically require some level of advanced specialized training.\n\nRegarding inflation, the headline measure of personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation is currently running at 1.4 percent on a 12-month basis.[6] At the Dallas Fed, we prefer to focus on the Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean PCE measure of inflation, which removes the most extreme moves up and down in PCE components. This measure is currently running at approximately 2 percent on a 12-month basis.[7] Dallas Fed research suggests that the trimmed mean measure of inflation is a good indicator of future inflation trends. On that basis, it is our expectation that the headline PCE inflation rate will reach the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target over the medium term.\n\nI am often asked: Why is growth today so much slower than it was in the 1980s and the 1990s? Why are market-determined interest rates so much lower? Why is the federal funds rate today so much lower than in these previous periods?\n\nA big part of the answer to these questions lies in the fact that there have been substantial secular changes in the U.S. economy. At the Dallas Fed, we refer to these as “structural drivers.” These structural drivers include:\n\nOf course, there are other major trends. One of the most significant is climate change and its implications for the increased frequency and intensity of severe weather events, such as hurricanes, droughts, floods, and other disruptive impacts (see the essay “A Brief Discussion Regarding the Impact of Climate Change on Economic Conditions in the Eleventh District,” June 27, 2019). At the Dallas Fed, we will continue to do research and analyze the various impacts of climate change on the Eleventh District, as well as the U.S. and the world.\n\nThe following is a discussion of four primary structural drivers. Over the past several years, our Dallas Fed economists have spent a substantial amount of time discussing these key structural drivers and trying to understand their implications for economic outcomes and economic policy decisions in the U.S.\n\n1. Demographic Trends\n\nThe U.S. population is aging. The median age of the population has risen from approximately 35.3 years in 2000 to 38.2 in 2018.[8] The share of population 65 years or older has risen from 12.4 percent in 2000 to 16.0 in 2018.[9] As baby boomers increasingly leave the workforce, U.S. labor force growth is slowing. Slower labor force growth is critically important because GDP growth is made up of growth in the workforce plus growth in labor productivity. Unless slower workforce growth is offset by improved productivity growth, U.S. GDP growth will slow. Chart 1 shows the ongoing trends of population aging and declines in population and labor force growth rates in the U.S.\n\n\n\nAnother way to look at labor force growth is to look at the labor force participation rate. This rate is the percentage of the population age 16 and older that either has a job or is actively looking for work. This rate has decreased from approximately 66 percent in 2007 to 63.2 percent today.[10] Dallas Fed economists believe that the bulk of this decline is due to the aging of the population. We expect this measure to decline further to 61 percent over the next 10 years as the population continues to age and the rate of workforce growth continues to decelerate.[11] As discussed earlier, these trends create a significant headwind for GDP growth.\n\nLabor force growth has been a key aspect of sustained U.S. growth over the past several decades. Increasing female labor force participation boosted growth from the 1950s to the 1990s. Since the 1990s, U.S. labor force growth has been helped by older workers staying in the workforce longer. Throughout our history, immigration of workers has also been a key aspect of U.S. labor force growth.\n\nThe Dallas Fed does a substantial amount of research on immigration trends. Pia Orrenius, senior economist at the Dallas Fed, has pointed out that more than 50 percent of workforce growth over the past 20 years has come from immigrants and their children.[12] Her research indicates that immigrants tend to take jobs at both the low end and the high end of the workforce and do not appear to have negatively impacted wages of indigenous workers overall. Her research also indicates that, from a policy point of view, the U.S. might be well-served to restructure its immigration policies to be more employer- and skills-based. Her work suggests that if the U.S. is to improve workforce growth in the years ahead, immigration is likely to be a key element of this effort.\n\nIn summary, slowing workforce growth is likely to be a continuing headwind for U.S. economic growth. Finding ways to grow the workforce will be critical to improving GDP growth prospects for the U.S.\n\n2. Technology, Technology-Enabled Disruption, and Education/Skills Training (See Appendix)\n\nWhile the U.S. has experienced rapid improvements in technology and substantial development of technology-enabled disruption in a variety of industries, measures of labor force productivity growth have been surprisingly sluggish. As explained earlier, GDP growth is made up of growth in the workforce and growth in productivity. If workforce growth is slowing due to aging of the population, it is critical that we find ways to improve productivity growth.\n\nOutput per worker grew on average approximately 1.9 percent per year in the 1990s, slowed to 1.4 percent in the 2000s and has slowed further to 1.1 percent since 2010.[13] Our hypothesis at the Dallas Fed is that intensifying technology and technology-enabled disruption is improving the productivity of a substantial number of U.S. companies and industries. Productivity improvement is measured not by industry, but by improvement in average output per worker in the overall economy. Part of the issue is that technological innovation may impact output per worker with a lag, and some believe that we may see improvements in these output statistics in the future, after a period of adoption and adaptation. However, Dallas Fed economists also believe that a key reason that we don’t see better workforce productivity data is that technological innovations are likely being experienced differently by workers based on their educational attainment and/or skill levels.\n\nIn particular, if you are one of the 46 million workers in this country with a high school education or less, and/or have a routine type of middle-skills job, you are likely finding your job is being either restructured or eliminated as a result of technology. Many of those workers with less education may be finding that their real wages and productivity are declining in a new age in which skills training and educational achievement levels are increasingly critical to adapting to the jobs market.\n\nThe increase in technology and technology-enabled disruption is also putting a spotlight on the adaptive capabilities of the workforce. In particular, better educational achievement and improved skill levels are critical to improving workforce adaptability. Various research studies have highlighted that the educational achievement and skill levels of the U.S. workforce have lagged those of other developed countries. In surveys of 29 participating Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, the U.S. ranked 20th in assessments of adult literacy and math skills.[14] It also ranked 24th out of 35 developed countries in measures of math, science and reading skills among 15-year-olds.[15]\n\nResearch by Eric Hanushek of Stanford University with Ludger Woessmann of the University of Munich suggests that improvements in math and science skills could translate into meaningful improvements in potential U.S. GDP growth.[16]\n\nDallas Fed economists believe that in order to address the powerful structural driver of technology and technology-enabled disruption, the U.S. must do more to improve early-childhood literacy, college readiness, and skills training at our high schools and community colleges. These efforts should be a powerful investment in improving the quality and productivity of our human capital which, in a technological age, are essential to higher levels of GDP growth in the U.S.\n\n3. Globalization and Trade\n\nThe U.S. has less than 5 percent of the world’s population.[17] It is estimated that the Standard and Poor’s 500 companies in the U.S. now generate in excess of 40 percent of their revenues from outside the U.S.[18] In addition, in order to be globally competitive, many of our companies have developed highly sophisticated cross-border supply-chain and logistics arrangements with Mexico and Canada. Dallas Fed economists believe these arrangements have helped these companies improve their global competitiveness.\n\nDallas Fed economists have suggested that U.S. trade analysis should segment our trading relationships into those which are primarily final goods versus those which are largely intermediate goods. For example, the trading relationship with Mexico is predominantly intermediate goods. This helps explain why approximately 40 percent of the value of U.S. imports[19] from Mexico consists of value added from the U.S., which is indicative of integrated supply-chain and logistics relationships that have allowed U.S. companies to add jobs and increase their global competitiveness.[20] On the other hand, the trading relationship with China is primarily a final-goods relationship (approximately 4 percent of the value of U.S. imports from China contains value added from the U.S.).[21] In addition, as has been much discussed, the trade relationship with China is fraught with issues related to technology transfer and intellectual property rights.\n\nWhile trade is important to the U.S., it is vital to many countries outside the U.S. Exports currently account for approximately 12 percent of U.S. GDP.[22] However, exports account for approximately 47 percent of German GDP,[23] 20 percent of euro-area GDP[24] and 27 percent of emerging-market GDP.[25] As a result, it is not surprising that escalating trade tensions disproportionately impact non-U.S. economic growth. It is also not surprising that as trade uncertainty has risen, particularly with Mexico and Canada, it has had some dampening impact on U.S. manufacturing and investments relating to global supply-chain arrangements.\n\nIf your job is being disrupted or eliminated in the U.S., the recent public narrative has suggested that it is probably due to globalization—either trade or immigration. Dallas Fed economists believe that this disruption is more likely due to technology and/or technology-enabled disruption. Our economists point out that if policymakers get this diagnosis wrong, we are likely to make policy decisions which impede globalization—and the net effect is likely to be slower growth in the U.S. This misdiagnosis would not be so consequential if we weren’t so highly leveraged at the federal government level.\n\n4. The Path of U.S. Government Debt to GDP\n\nU.S. government debt held by the public now stands at approximately 76 percent of GDP,[26] and the present value of unfunded entitlements is estimated at approximately $59 trillion.[27] The recent tax legislation and bipartisan budget compromise legislation are likely to exacerbate these issues, and the U.S. deficit is poised to exceed $1 trillion in 2020.[28] As a consequence of this rising level of debt, the U.S. will have less fiscal capacity to fight the next recession.\n\nThe U.S. relies heavily on the presumption that the dollar is likely to be the world’s reserve currency for the foreseeable future. That is, global investors tend to overweight their asset allocations to dollars. This, of course, is highly beneficial when the projected issuance of U.S. Treasury securities is likely to rise substantially. However, it is worth considering the implications if the dollar ceases to be the world’s reserve currency sometime in the future. Is it wise for the U.S. to rely so heavily on this presumption in managing its financial affairs?\n\nPreviously, I have written about the historically elevated level of corporate debt in the U.S. I have noted that this is probably not, at this point, a systemic risk but more likely an amplifier in the event of an economic slowdown (see “Corporate Debt as a Potential Amplifier in a Slowdown,” March 5, 2019). It is worth noting that high levels of government debt, along with elevated levels of corporate debt, mean that the U.S. economy is becoming much more interest rate sensitive. That is, increases in interest rates would likely require a higher proportion of cash flow in order to service corporate and government debt obligations.\n\nStructural reforms and other actions that moderate the path of future government debt growth may be advisable to keep this short-term-growth tailwind from becoming a medium- and longer-term headwind to economic growth in the U.S. In the meantime, this historically high level of U.S. government debt means that there will likely be less capacity to use fiscal policy in the event of an economic downturn.\n\nMany of the issues raised by these structural drivers are primarily outside the purview of monetary policy. That is, while monetary policy has a key role to play, I believe it is likely that we will need broader economic policy actions if we are to improve the growth potential of the U.S. economy and the future prosperity of our citizens.\n\nImmigration and trade policies, education reform and skills training, and managing the future path of U.S. government debt are all policy judgments that are made outside the purview of monetary policy and the remit of the Federal Reserve. However, part of my job as a central banker at the Dallas Fed is to share our economic research and call out these issues to elected and appointed officials in hopes that our research will help inform their judgments and highlight the need for broader economic policy at the city, state and federal levels. I am hopeful that this effort will help improve economic performance in the Eleventh District and the nation.\n\nAs discussed earlier, I supported the FOMC’s 25-basis-point reductions in the federal funds rate at the July and September meetings. I am concerned that if non-U.S. growth continues to decelerate, and weakness in U.S. manufacturing and business investment intensifies, this weakness could spread to the broader U.S. economy, ultimately impacting consumer confidence and spending.\n\nWhile strong consumer spending is a welcome underpinning to growth, I recognize that it is more of a “coincident” indicator; that is, it doesn’t provide great insight regarding future prospects for the economy. Consumer confidence can be fragile—one or two months of weak jobs reports could put a dent in consumer confidence and spending habits, which could further slow GDP growth. This is why I’ve repeatedly said that if we wait to see weakness in the consumer before taking action, we will have likely waited too long. From a risk-management point of view, that is a mistake I prefer not to make.\n\nA reality check for my thinking has been the level and shape of the U.S. Treasury curve. The 10-year Treasury rate has declined from 3.24 percent on November 8, 2018, to 1.59 percent at the time of this essay.[29] During that same time period, the federal funds rate has declined from a range of 2 to 2.25 percent to 1.75 to 2 percent. It is worth noting that the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) median estimate of the federal funds rate at the end of 2021 has gone from 3.25 to 3.50 percent in the September 2018 summary[30] to 2 to 2.25 percent in the recent September 2019 submission.[31]\n\nIt is my view that the level and shape of the Treasury curve are reflective of slowing global growth, heightened trade tensions and a more pessimistic view regarding the prospects for U.S. economic growth. Pessimism regarding prospects for global growth is also one key reason why approximately 22 percent of global government debt is now trading at negative yields.[32]\n\nI believe that moves in U.S. market-determined rates are consistent with concerns about economic weakness spreading more broadly to other parts of the U.S. economy. For me, these moves in market-determined rates are a reality check that suggests the setting of the federal funds rate was tighter than appropriate prior to the July and September FOMC meetings. In this regard, I intend to continue to carefully monitor the yield curve and gauge the ongoing implications of negative gaps between the federal funds rate and yields on longer-dated Treasury securities.\n\nAt this juncture, having adjusted the policy rate twice this year, it is my intention to take some time to carefully monitor economic developments. I am mindful of the potential excesses and imbalances that can be created as a result of excessive accommodation. I am also alert to the possibility that recent escalations in trade tensions could moderate somewhat and this, in turn, might alleviate some of the downside risks to the U.S. and global economies. In any event, I intend to avoid being rigid or predetermined from here, and plan to remain highly vigilant and keep an open mind as to whether further action on the federal funds rate is appropriate.\n\nAs Dallas Fed economists have been discussing for the past several years, technology-enabled disruption means workers are increasingly being replaced by technology. It also means that existing business models are being supplanted by new models, often technology-enabled, for more efficiently selling or distributing goods and services. In addition, consumers are increasingly using technology to shop for goods and services at lower prices with greater convenience—having the impact of reducing the pricing power of businesses which has, in turn, caused them to further intensify their focus on creating greater operational efficiencies. These trends appear to be accelerating.\n\nIt is likely that disruption is a factor in economic outcomes being increasingly skewed by the educational attainment levels of workers. For example, for those who have a college degree, the unemployment rate stands at 2.0 percent, and the labor force participation rate is 73.9 percent. If you have some college education, the unemployment rate is 2.9 percent and the participation rate is 65.1 percent; a high school diploma, the unemployment rate is 3.6 percent and the participation rate is 57.8 percent; and some high school education, the unemployment rate is 4.8 percent and the participation rate is 46.0 percent.[33]\n\nIncreasingly, workers with lower levels of educational attainment are seeing their jobs restructured or eliminated. Unless they have sufficient math and literacy skills or are retrained, these workers may likely see their productivity and incomes decline as a result of disruption. This may help explain the muted levels of wage gains and overall labor productivity growth we see in the U.S. as well as other advanced economies.\n\nThe impact of technology-enabled disruption on the workforce is likely less susceptible to monetary policy—addressing this challenge requires structural reforms. The reforms could include actions which would be aimed at improving early childhood literacy, as well as improving math, reading and science achievement levels among high school students. These efforts could help boost overall college readiness in order to increase the percentage of students who graduate college in six years or less—now estimated at 60 percent in the U.S.[34] Addressing the impacts of technology-enabled disruption will also require stepped-up efforts to increase middle-skills training in cities across the U.S. in order to improve employment, close the skills gap (not enough workers to fill skilled jobs) and raise worker productivity. These initiatives could improve educational achievement levels in order to better equip our citizens to thrive in a world that increasingly demands greater education, training and adaptability.\n\nDisruption may also help explain why companies, facing one or more disruptive competitors, have been more cautious about making capacity-expansion decisions and investing in major capital projects. The recent tax legislation may help create incentives to improve the level of capital investment.\n\nTo deal with disruptive changes and lack of pricing power, many companies are seeking to achieve greater scale economies in order to maintain or improve profit margins. This may help explain the record level of merger-and-acquisition activity globally over the past few years.\n\nNotes",

            "content": "Based on the essay, “Economic Conditions and the Stance of Monetary Policy,” published on June 24, 2019.\n\n\n\nThe Eleventh Federal Reserve District comprises Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico. Texas job growth in 2018 was approximately 2.3 percent, and we expect jobs to grow at a solid rate in 2019.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Eleventh District is particularly impacted by developments in the energy industry and international trade, as Texas is both the largest energy producer of any state and the nation’s largest exporter. It is also important to note that growth in Texas continues to be aided by the migration of people and firms to the state. This migration has helped bring human capital and new businesses to the state, which have helped fuel the diversification of industry and the development of its largest metropolitan areas: Houston, Dallas–Fort Worth, San Antonio and Austin.[1]\n\nOne factor we are increasingly discussing at the Dallas Fed is the impact of climate change on the Eleventh District. In particular, severe weather events can have a substantial human and economic cost to the district.\n\nOne recent example is Hurricane Harvey, which occurred in August 2017. It is estimated that Harvey caused approximately $74 billion in property damage and lost output in the state.[2] While the gross domestic product (GDP) and job losses appear to have been transitory, the lasting impact in Houston and along the Texas coast continues to be felt in the form of displacement of communities, ongoing rebuilding efforts, increased insurance costs, public spending on mitigation efforts, and more stringent building codes. In addition, the storm disproportionately impacted low-income families by wiping out their savings, impacting their ability to safely domicile their families and increasing their need for health care and related services.[3] Given the extent of the damage, a key question for civic leaders, businesses and residents is the extent to which severe weather events like Harvey are likely to be unusual and sporadic in the future or whether they are likely to become more frequent in the years ahead.\n\nThe Eleventh District is home to approximately 50 of the Fortune 500 companies. It is also a major infrastructure hub for the nation’s energy production, transmission and refining capability. The seaports along the Gulf Coast as well as the inland ports in our major metro areas and along the U.S.–Mexico border play a critical role for the U.S. in trade and immigration.\n\nIn this context, my Dallas Fed research team is focused on the extent that severe weather events such as hurricanes, droughts, flooding and tornadoes are increasingly likely to impact our people, cities, critical energy infrastructure and key industries. While our district has historically exhibited great resilience in response to the effects of severe weather, the latest National Climate Assessment, a comprehensive report on climate change and its impacts, indicates that the severity and damage caused by extreme weather events are likely to intensify in the years ahead. (See the appendix for a discussion of the National Climate Assessment findings and conclusions.)\n\nA hurricane is defined as a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of at least 74 mph. Since 2000, approximately 20 hurricanes have impacted the Gulf of Mexico region of the U.S., comprising Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida.[4] Over this period, 14 tropical storms passed through Texas, with six of these having sufficient maximum sustained winds to be categorized as hurricanes.\n\nThe National Climate Assessment asserts that the intensity of hurricane activity is likely to increase. This trend is likely to be associated with greater rainfall during these severe storms.[5] In addition, the report indicates that climate change is likely to cause global sea levels to rise an average of 1–4 feet during the remainder of the 21st century.[6] As a result of rises in sea level, it is probable that the risk of flooding on the western Gulf of Mexico coast will increase.[7]\n\nThese developments could impact economic conditions in the Eleventh Federal Reserve District and U.S. because of the impact on coastal infrastructure, which connects the nation to energy supplies as well as access to goods and services from overseas trade. In addition, as a result of these trends, the costs to repair damage to Gulf Coast facilities are expected to grow substantially.[8]\n\nAs discussed earlier, one recent example of the impact of severe storms is Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall on Aug. 25, 2017, in the area just north of Corpus Christi, Texas. As Harvey stalled over the Houston metro area, some areas recorded more than 50 inches of rain in a five-day period and experienced substantial flooding as local bayous, rivers and reservoirs overflowed their banks.[9] According to estimates by Moody’s Analytics, Hurricane Harvey had total direct costs of approximately $65 billion and indirect costs of approximately $8.5 billion.[10] Tragically, 68 people are estimated to have lost their lives as a direct result of the storm. More than 300,000 homes and businesses and approximately 500,000 cars were flooded.[11]\n\nHarvey led to an estimated 16,000 lost jobs in the Texas Gulf Coast region—however, the Dallas Fed estimates that as of the end of 2017, employment on the Gulf Coast had more than fully recovered.[12] While increased economic activity was associated with reconstruction efforts, there are more lingering impacts including lost homes and businesses, increased insurance costs and costs of government programs to mitigate future damages.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the Gulf Coast is home to a substantial concentration of refinery capacity, chemical industry infrastructure and offshore production facilities. At its peak, approximately 25 percent of the Gulf of Mexico’s offshore oil and natural gas production was shut in as a result of Harvey.[13] Refinery utilization along the Gulf Coast fell from in excess of 90 percent to approximately 60 percent.[14] More than 50 percent of U.S. output of basic petrochemicals was temporarily disrupted.[15] The refinery outages resulting from Harvey-related shutdowns led to a temporary increase in U.S. gasoline prices of 28 cents.[16]\n\nIn the aftermath of this storm, Gulf Coast cities as well as the state of Texas and various federal agencies have been working together to undertake multibillion-dollar investments to upgrade reservoir and flood mitigation infrastructure to better protect the region (residents and businesses) in the event of future weather events.\n\nClimate change is expected to increase dryness in the Eleventh District as temperatures rise, as well as increase the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation.[17] For the agriculture sector, this increased weather variability will naturally lead to increased agricultural production variability and risk. These trends may also lead to challenges relating to water availability in the state.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, “drought is the leading driver of production risk in U.S. agriculture … [as it] can reduce crop yields, lead farmers to cut back planted or harvested acreage, reduce livestock productivity, and increase costs of production inputs such as animal feed or irrigation water.”[18] For the livestock sector—which accounts for more than 60 percent of agricultural production in Texas[19]—drought effects are often felt over multiple years due to the resulting pasture damage and herd reduction that take years to recover from.\n\nIn Texas, where farm employment makes up approximately 1.6 percent of employment, and farm output makes up approximately 0.4 percent of state GDP,[20] agricultural losses from the historic 2011 drought were estimated to be in excess of $7 billion, accounting for about 40 percent of the average value of agricultural production and far exceeding loss estimates from any prior drought on record.[21] Droughts also induce additional indirect effects from reduced agribusiness activity in drought years—fertilizer, crop storage, machinery—plus the decrease in expenditures in the local economy resulting from lost income for producers, harvest laborers, truck drivers and agribusinesses.\n\nHeavy precipitation, which is expected to continue to increase in both frequency and intensity as climate change progresses,[22] also causes problems for agriculture, as seen this year in Texas and in other parts of the country. When flooding happens early in the season, fields become too wet for farmers to prepare the soil and plant crops, causing delays which lead to reduced yields or crop substitution. Flooding late in the season causes harvest delays and crop quality issues, which both hamper farm income. Hotter temperatures prompted by climate change also pose additional pest problems for farmers, driving up pesticide use and costs, and hamper livestock productivity—increasing time to grow animals to a given weight and decreasing calving rates and milk production.[23]\n\nThe inherent risks in the agriculture industry may be exacerbated by climate change, which could make it more difficult for agricultural producers to get sufficient financing and insurance. As crop yields become more variable, lenders may become more concerned about repayment of crop production loans and tighten their lending standards and terms. Also, insurance costs will go up as insurers have more indemnities to pay out from droughts or floods. Adaptations in the agricultural sector to mitigate the impact of drought cycles include planting more drought-resistant crops, increasing irrigation, and technological advances in water retention and irrigation application. In Texas, we may see a shift to more cotton acreage, as cotton can tolerate more heat than grain crops and has a wider time frame for planting and harvesting, which is beneficial in times of flooding.\n\nBesides increased hurricane intensity and greater risk of drought, climate change may have additional impacts that could affect our district. Increased temperatures are likely to have an adverse effect on people’s health and quality of life.[24] They will likely lead to increased water evaporation and soil moisture deterioration, as well as aquifer drawdowns.[25] Increased ocean acidity and warming will affect aquatic life, impacting the commercial and recreational fishing industries along the Gulf Coast.[26]\n\nAs a central banker, I do not delve into the political and other controversial aspects of this subject. However, I do intently focus on the ways severe weather events and climate-related trends are likely impacting economic conditions and financial stability in the Eleventh District and the nation.\n\nIt is the view of Dallas Fed economists that severe weather events pose a “tail risk” for certain cities and industries in our district. This is not new. However, while many of the impacts of these severe weather events have historically been transitory, we are increasingly cognizant of the longer-term risks that are leading several cities and companies to make substantial capital investments in improving infrastructure in order to mitigate the damage of future severe weather.\n\nFor now, it is the view of the Dallas Fed that severe weather-related tail risks are unlikely to materially negatively impact the medium-term economic performance of Texas and overall outlook for the region. However, if the National Climate Assessment predictions regarding the likely frequency and/or severity of extreme weather events turn out to be accurate, these extreme weather events may begin to have a negative impact on the region’s longer-term business prospects and migration trends.\n\nBusinesses, elected officials and civic leaders are taking a number of steps to manage these risks. State and local leaders are studying various infrastructure investments in order to upgrade the viability of neighborhoods, protect at-risk populations who lack the resources to recover from severe weather events, protect businesses, and ensure the ongoing production, transportation and transmission of energy services in the event of a severe weather-related disruption.\n\nIn addition, in our extensive discussions with energy industry contacts as well as broad business contacts, we are learning that businesses are investing much more heavily in alternative energy projects and sustainability initiatives. Energy companies are making substantial investments in moderating the environmental impacts of shale oil production. A number of energy companies and private equity firms are actively investing in battery storage and wind and solar projects that could diversify sources of energy in the U.S. In addition, Texas is now the largest wind-energy-producing state in the nation.[27] Many companies are adopting greenhouse-gas emissions targets and making investments to reduce their carbon footprint.\n\nAt the Dallas Fed, we are actively working to play a research and convening role throughout the Eleventh District to help frame these issues and discuss approaches that would improve the region’s ability to manage the effects of future severe weather events.[28] In addition, in order to improve our sustainability leadership and enhance our insight into these matters, the Dallas Fed has established a sustainability initiative intended to reduce our own greenhouse gas emissions and empower our employees to take actions which will improve the sustainability performance of our Bank.[29]\n\nThe purpose of this essay (including the appendix) has been to lay out key elements of the National Climate Assessment and discuss some of the potential implications of severe weather events for the Eleventh District. Dallas Fed economists will continue to carefully monitor and consider the impact of climate change on economic and financial conditions in the district and the nation.\n\nIn 1989, President George H.W. Bush created the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP). It was more formally established by Congress in 1990 via the Global Change Research Act. The USGCRP was given the mandate to develop and coordinate “a comprehensive and integrated United States research program which will assist the Nation and the world to understand, assess, predict, and respond to human-induced and natural processes of global change.”[30]\n\nThe USGCRP is comprised of 13 federal agencies that conduct or use research on global change and its impact on society. These agencies include the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services, Interior, State and Transportation, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, National Science Foundation, Smithsonian Institution and U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nEvery four years, the USGCRP prepares an assessment, known as the National Climate Assessment (NCA). The NCA analyzes the effects of global change on the natural environment, agriculture, energy production and use, transportation, human health and biological diversity; and it describes current trends in global change and projects trends for the subsequent 25 to 100 years.\n\nThe most recent NCA was completed in November 2018 and was produced by a team of more than 300 experts, with input from external stakeholders. An expert external peer review of the report was performed by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.[31]\n\nThe NCA concludes “that the evidence of human-caused climate change is overwhelming and continues to strengthen, that the impacts of climate change are intensifying across the country, and that climate-related threats to Americans’ physical, social, and economic well-being are rising.”[32] The report cites “significant, clear, and compelling evidence that global average temperature is much higher, and is rising more rapidly, than anything modern civilization has experienced, with widespread and growing impacts.”[33]\n\nThe report also explains that greenhouse gases absorb heat in the atmosphere near the Earth’s surface, preventing it from escaping out into space. If the atmospheric concentrations of these gases rise, the average temperature of the lower atmosphere will gradually increase as the heat emitted by Earth is retained inside the climate system, warming the planet, a phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect.[34] Greenhouse gases include, for example, carbon dioxide, water vapor and methane.\n\nThe report cites studies which estimate that the global average temperature rose approximately 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit between 1901 and 2016,[35] and that for the period since 1986, global annual average temperatures appear to have increased at a more rapid rate than for any similar 20–30-year time period in at least the last 1,700 years.[36]\n\nThe NCA states that “annual average temperatures in the United States are projected to continue to increase in the coming decades.”[37] The report indicates that recent record-setting temperatures are expected to become common in the near future. By late this century, the report estimates that in the U.S., increases of 2.3°–6.7°F are expected under a relatively optimistic climate change scenario and 5.4°–11.0°F under a more dire scenario, relative to 1986–2015.[38]\n\nIn addition to temperature rise, the report suggests that we are likely to see further increases in ocean temperature as well as progressive melting in glaciers and ice sheets, some shrinking in snow cover and sea ice, rising sea levels, and more frequent high temperature extremes and heavy precipitation events.[39],[40]\n\nThe NCA argues that heavy rainfall events are associated with climate change. The report explains that, due to the relationships between levels of temperature and humidity, the frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall events are expected to increase over the coming century. The report asserts that warmer temperatures lead to increasing evaporation rates. This trend is likely to cause higher levels of water vapor in the atmosphere, which is likely to lead to more frequent and intense precipitation extremes.[41]\n\nThe NCA indicates that climate change has contributed to increases in Atlantic hurricane activity since 1970.[42] It also asserts that hurricane rainfall and intensity are projected to increase as a result of rises in sea surface temperatures and changes in atmospheric conditions.[43] While the frequency of tropical storms is not expected to change, the number of more-severe storms—those with sustained wind speeds in excess of 130 mph (referred to as Category 4 and 5 hurricanes)—is expected to increase.[44]\n\nThe report warns that U.S. coastal infrastructure could be adversely impacted by this trend. This infrastructure provides critical energy supplies and access to goods and services from overseas trade.[45] The report further highlights that reliable and affordable energy supplies, which support broad sectors of the U.S. economy, are increasingly at risk from climate change and weather extremes.[46]\n\nAcross much of the U.S., climate change is also expected to decrease surface soil moisture due to increased evaporation rates associated with warmer temperatures. This means that future droughts in certain regions of the U.S. are likely to be stronger and potentially last longer. The NCA explains that when droughts occur simultaneously with especially warm temperatures, it creates conditions for substantial wildfires, which have increased in frequency across the western U.S. since the 1980s.[47] Droughts can also have a significant impact on agriculture.\n\nFor a fuller explanation of the NCA report, please see the link, National Climate Assessment.",

            "content": "June 24, 2019\n\nAt the recent June meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left the federal funds rate unchanged in a range of 2.25 to 2.5 percent. In our statement, the FOMC indicated that uncertainties about the outlook have increased and stated that “in light of these uncertainties and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective.”[1]\n\nThe purpose of this essay is to describe my assessment of economic conditions in the U.S. and global economies. In addition, I will discuss business activity in the Eleventh Federal Reserve District and describe how the implications of climate change are impacting Dallas Fed economic analysis of the district and the nation. Lastly, I will discuss my views regarding the appropriate stance of U.S. monetary policy.\n\nDallas Fed economists expect U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) to grow at a rate of approximately 2 percent in 2019. This is slower than the 3 percent growth achieved in 2018, primarily due to continued waning of U.S. fiscal stimulus, a lower rate of global growth and increased business uncertainty due mostly to heightened trade tensions.\n\nThe U.S. economy has been bolstered by a strong consumer. Household balance sheets are in relatively healthy shape—household debt declined from 97 percent of GDP at year-end 2008 to approximately 75 percent in the first quarter of 2019.[2] In addition, a tight labor market has given an added boost to consumer spending and confidence. The consumer is approximately 70 percent of the U.S. economy, so this strength provides a solid underpinning to the outlook for growth.\n\nOn the cautionary side, trade tensions and uncertainty have increased significantly over the past two months. Tariffs and trade uncertainty appear to be having a negative impact on companies’ ability to manage input costs and some chilling influence on their capital spending plans. Even before this recent escalation, nonresidential fixed investment had contributed only 0.3 percentage points to GDP growth in the first quarter versus an average of 0.9 for 2017 and 2018.[3] In a recent Dallas Fed Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey, more than half of companies responding reported that tariffs are increasing their input costs, and a material number of companies reported a reduction in their capital spending plans.[4]\n\nThere is evidence that tariffs and trade uncertainties may be impacting manufacturing activity. The most recent manufacturing sector surveys from the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia and Dallas all show significant deterioration in manufacturing business sentiment.\n\nOne positive development worth noting is that balance sheets of U.S. banks appear to be in much better shape than 10 years ago. While I have flagged the high level of corporate debt as a potential amplifier in the next downturn, I would also note that the improvement in bank balance sheets means that they should be capable of extending credit in a way that is supportive of further economic expansion. The Fed’s recent stress tests indicate that, after adjusting for stress-scenario losses, capital levels at the largest U.S. banks would still be above capital levels those banks held before the financial crisis of 2008–09.[5]\n\nThe Labor Market\n\nThe U.S. unemployment rate is 3.6 percent.[6] At the Dallas Fed, we particularly focus on U-6, a broader measure of unemployment that tracks unemployed plus discouraged workers who have given up looking for work, plus part-time workers who would prefer to work full time. This measure is now 7.1 percent, which is well below its prerecession low of 7.9 percent in December 2006.\n\nThe labor force participation rate now stands at 62.8 percent. It has ranged between 62.4 percent and 63.2 percent for the past five years. The participation rate is the percentage of people 16 years of age and older who participate in the workforce by either working or looking for work.\n\nOne factor supporting the overall participation rate is the improvement in the participation rate of prime-age workers (25 to 54). Prime-age participation has increased from 80.9 percent in 2015 to 82.1 percent today. Chart 1 highlights these trends in labor force participation.\n\n\n\nIt is important to recognize that the aging of the U.S. workforce is negatively impacting the overall participation rate because as workers age, an increasing percentage are more likely to retire. It is the view of Dallas Fed economists that increasing participation of prime-age workers is unlikely to last indefinitely—aging population demographics will tend to bring down the overall labor force participation rate. In light of these trends, it is our view that the labor force participation rate will likely decline to below 61 percent over the next 10 years, even as workers tend to remain in the labor force later in their careers.[7]\n\nThe May jobs growth number was approximately 75,000—lower than the average monthly job growth of approximately 223,000 in 2018 and 186,000 in 2019 through April.[8] It is the view of Dallas Fed economists that moderation in the rate of job growth is consistent with a labor market that is tight and likely at or past the level of full employment in the U.S. As a consequence of this tightness, we would expect job growth to remain moderate in the months ahead. Long-run GDP growth is made up of growth in the workforce and growth in labor productivity. Assuming there is not an offsetting burst in productivity growth, a slowing rate of workforce growth will likely translate into slowing GDP growth in the U.S.\n\nIf we are at or past full employment, why is the average nominal rate of wage growth only 3.1 percent?[9] Also, even with the moderation in May jobs growth, why has job growth in 2019 averaged approximately 164,000 workers per month, well over what is necessary to keep up with population growth?[10]\n\nRegarding wages, our Dallas Fed economists believe that more muted inflation and inflation expectations, as compared with previous expansions, are factors tempering nominal wage growth in this expansion. Also, they argue that older workers have increased as a share of the labor force over the past 10 years—and their rate of wage growth tends to be more tepid than that of younger workers.[11] Lastly, our economists believe that more subdued productivity growth has likely had a somewhat muting impact on wage growth.\n\nOn a related point, research by the Dallas Fed’s Joe Tracy and Michael Morris along with Robert Rich of the Cleveland Fed indicates that individual wage growth is, in fact, higher than standard statistics have suggested. Their research finds that the growth rate of widely followed wage indicators like average hourly earnings are disproportionately weighted to high-wage earners, who are also typically older and have a lower rate of wage growth. They find that an average of individual wage growth rates, which equally weights the wage growth of all workers, has been close to 5 percent in recent years—materially higher than the 3.1 percent average hourly earnings measure recorded in May 2019.[12]\n\nRegarding recent job gains, one key driver has been the improvement in prime-age labor force participation (described earlier). As part of this improvement, it is important to note recent gains reflect disproportionate improvements in participation by previously underrepresented groups. For example, Hispanic women across educational attainment levels, as well as black men with a high school diploma or less, have disproportionately improved their levels of labor force participation. Chart 2 provides a breakdown of recent changes in participation rates, based on educational attainment, race/ethnicity and gender.\n\n\n\nThese recent improvements in the participation of previously underrepresented groups as well as the growth in wages are welcome developments. To the extent historically underrepresented groups can be drawn into the workforce and gain the skills and experience that enhance their likelihood of staying in the labor force, this should have the impact of increasing the size and productive capacity of the U.S. labor force.\n\nIncreasing the size and productive capacity of the labor force is especially important as firms face significant difficulties trying to find workers. A recent Dallas Fed Texas Business Outlook Survey finds that 71 percent of firms surveyed are seeking to hire and 83 percent of those firms report that they are having difficulty finding qualified workers.[13]\n\nAs discussed earlier, it is the view of Dallas Fed economists that while there is some scope for further gains in labor force participation, it will not be sufficient to offset the effects of a historically tight labor market. As a result, it is likely that the rate of job growth will remain moderate in the months ahead. In this regard, we believe that job growth in the range of 60,000 to 120,000 jobs per month will be consistent with a “strong”[14] jobs market for the remainder of 2019.\n\nInflation\n\nThe most recent personal consumption expenditures (PCE) reading of inflation was approximately 1.5 percent on a 12-month basis.[15] Our Dallas Fed economists prefer to look at the Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean PCE measure of inflation, which has been running consistently between 1.9 and 2 percent over the past year—and is currently running at approximately 2 percent.[16] This reading of core inflation exes out extreme moves to the upside and downside in individual inflation components. Research by my Dallas Fed colleagues Evan Koenig and Jim Dolmas suggests that the trimmed mean measure is a highly useful indicator of future headline PCE inflation trends.[17] It is our expectation that the trimmed mean will end this year in the range of 2 percent and that headline PCE inflation will move higher over the next 12 months.\n\nI have written and spoken about the idea that there are two key elements of inflation: the cyclical and the structural. Dallas Fed economists believe these two forces are currently working in opposing fashion.\n\nCyclical inflationary forces are building. These cyclical forces are driven primarily by a tightening labor market and continuing wage gains. Historically, economists would have expected a tightening labor market to contribute to greater price pressures. This connection between labor market slack, wages and prices is sometimes referred to as the “Phillips curve.”[18] Given these cyclical factors, why hasn’t inflation been more apparent? Why have we spent most of the past seven years—and particularly the past two years, when the unemployment rate has been below most estimates of the natural rate of unemployment—with a headline PCE inflation rate below the Fed’s 2 percent objective?\n\nOur view at the Dallas Fed is that the structural forces of technology, technology-enabled disruption and, to some lesser extent, globalization are muting the relationship between labor market tightening and wage gains, and are even further muting the connection between wage gains and prices. Technology advancements such as artificial intelligence are allowing businesses to replace people with technology. In addition, new business models, often technology enabled and aided by the proliferation of mobile computing power, are disrupting old business models and allowing consumers to have more power in choosing the lowest price at a high level of convenience. Think Amazon, Uber, Lyft, Airbnb and so on. These models are often further enabled by the fact that the cost of capital is historically low, and financial markets are willing to assign these businesses substantial valuations and advance substantial amounts of capital, even though these companies frequently generate little or no profitability in their early years.\n\nAgainst this background, numerous Dallas Fed business contacts report having materially less pricing power today than they have had historically. Based on these discussions, it is our view that as cyclical forces build, which lead to increased costs, these cost increases are just as likely to lead to business margin erosion as they are higher prices.\n\nIn a historically tight labor market, cyclical inflationary pressures will likely remain elevated. The question is whether they are strong enough to offset the structural forces that are muting inflation. Time will tell, but we are watching this dynamic very carefully at the Dallas Fed. While the Phillips curve appears to have flattened, it might be a mistake to assume that it is dead—it may just be that the level of unemployment that creates undue price pressures is lower than we have historically experienced—but the overall dynamic hasn’t gone away completely.\n\nGlobal (ex the U.S.) GDP growth was approximately 4.3 percent in 2017, declined to 4.0 percent in 2018 and is expected to be 3.6 percent in 2019.[19] Furthermore, risks to this outlook appear to be tilted to the downside. Growth expectations are sluggish due to slowing growth in the euro area and in other advanced economies, as well as somewhat more muted growth in emerging economies.\n\nTrade tensions likely play some role in this softening. While exports are approximately 12 percent of U.S. GDP, they are 20 percent for China, 47 percent for Germany and 18 percent for Japan.[20] (See Chart 3.)\n\n\n\nWhile the U.S. may outperform many of these other countries, it is our view at the Dallas Fed that slower growth outside the U.S. is likely to translate into slower growth in the U.S. In this regard, it is worth noting that approximately 45 percent of S&P 500 company revenues come from outside the U.S.[21] While non-U.S. markets serve as important end markets for U.S. companies, logistics and supply-chain arrangements with Mexico, Canada and China are important to these companies in an effort to manage their costs. This is particularly true in North America.\n\nFor example, it is estimated that 73 percent of U.S. imports from Mexico are composed of intermediate goods; that is, goods that are part of integrated supply-chain and logistics relationships that allow U.S.-domiciled companies to increase their global competitiveness and keep jobs in this country.[22]\n\nOverview\n\nThe Eleventh Federal Reserve District comprises Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico. Texas job growth in 2018 was approximately 2.3 percent, and we expect jobs to grow at a solid rate in 2019.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Eleventh District is particularly impacted by developments in the energy industry and international trade, as Texas is both the largest energy producer of any state and the nation’s largest exporter. It is also important to note that growth in Texas continues to be aided by the migration of people and firms to the state. This migration has helped bring human capital and new businesses to the state, which have helped fuel the diversification of industry and the development of its largest metropolitan areas: Houston, Dallas–Fort Worth, San Antonio and Austin.[23]\n\nThe Impact of Climate Change: Frequency and Intensity of Severe Weather Events\n\nOne factor we are increasingly discussing at the Dallas Fed is the impact of climate change on the Eleventh District. In particular, severe weather events can have a substantial human and economic cost to the district.\n\nOne recent example is Hurricane Harvey, which occurred in August 2017. It is estimated that Harvey caused approximately $74 billion in property damage and lost output in the state.[24] While the GDP and job losses appear to have been transitory, the lasting impact in Houston and along the Texas coast continues to be felt in the form of displacement of communities, ongoing rebuilding efforts, increased insurance costs, public spending on mitigation efforts, and more stringent building codes. In addition, the storm disproportionately impacted low-income families by wiping out their savings, impacting their ability to safely domicile their families and increasing their need for health care and related services.[25] Given the extent of the damage, a key question for civic leaders, businesses and residents is the extent to which severe weather events like Harvey are likely to be unusual and sporadic in the future or whether they are likely to become more frequent in the years ahead.\n\nThe Eleventh District is home to approximately 50 of the Fortune 500 companies. It is also a major infrastructure hub for the nation’s energy production, transmission and refining capability. The seaports along the Gulf Coast as well as the inland ports in our major metro areas and along the U.S.–Mexico border play a critical role for the U.S. in trade and immigration.\n\nIn this context, my Dallas Fed research team is focused on the extent that severe weather events such as hurricanes, droughts, flooding and tornadoes are increasingly likely to impact our people, cities, critical energy infrastructure and key industries. While our district has historically exhibited great resilience in response to the effects of severe weather, the latest National Climate Assessment, a comprehensive report on climate change and its impacts, indicates that the severity and damage caused by extreme weather events are likely to intensify in the years ahead. (See the appendix for a discussion of the National Climate Assessment findings and conclusions, as well as a discussion of certain major considerations for the Eleventh District.)\n\nAs a central banker, I do not delve into the political and other controversial aspects of this subject. However, I do intently focus on the ways severe weather events and climate-related trends are likely impacting economic conditions and financial stability in the Eleventh District and the nation.\n\nIt is the view of Dallas Fed economists that severe weather events pose a “tail risk” for certain cities and industries in our district. This is not new. However, while many of the impacts of these severe weather events have historically been transitory, we are increasingly cognizant of the longer-term risks that are leading several cities and companies to make substantial capital investments in improving infrastructure in order to mitigate the damage of future severe weather.\n\nFor now, it is the view of the Dallas Fed that severe weather-related tail risks are unlikely to materially negatively impact the medium-term economic performance of Texas and overall outlook for the region. However, if the National Climate Assessment predictions regarding the likely frequency and/or severity of extreme weather events turn out to be accurate, these extreme weather events may begin to have a negative impact on the region’s longer-term business prospects and migration trends.\n\nAdaptation and Mitigation Efforts\n\nBusinesses, elected officials and civic leaders are taking a number of steps to manage these risks. State and local leaders are studying various infrastructure investments in order to upgrade the viability of neighborhoods, protect at-risk populations who lack the resources to recover from severe weather events, protect businesses, and ensure the ongoing production, transportation and transmission of energy services in the event of a severe weather-related disruption.\n\nIn addition, in our extensive discussions with energy industry contacts as well as broad business contacts, we are learning that businesses are investing much more heavily in alternative energy projects and sustainability initiatives.\n\nEnergy companies are making substantial investments in moderating the environmental impacts of shale oil production. A number of energy companies and private equity firms are actively investing in battery storage and wind and solar projects that could diversify sources of energy in the U.S. In addition, Texas is now the largest wind-energy-producing state in the nation.[26] Many companies are adopting greenhouse-gas emissions targets and making investments to reduce their carbon footprint.\n\nAt the Dallas Fed, we are actively working to play a research and convening role throughout the Eleventh District to help frame these issues and discuss approaches that would improve the region’s ability to manage the effects of future severe weather events.[27] In addition, in order to improve our sustainability leadership and enhance our insight into these matters, the Dallas Fed has established a sustainability initiative intended to reduce our own greenhouse gas emissions and empower our employees to take actions which will improve the sustainability performance of our Bank.[28]\n\nIn light of relatively solid rates of economic growth, a labor market at or past full employment and a PCE inflation rate somewhat below target, I believe it is appropriate to take a balanced approach to monetary policy. I would note that, while headline PCE inflation is running below target, the Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean measure of PCE inflation has been running at approximately 2 percent and our economists expect this measure of inflation to end the year in the neighborhood of 2 percent. In assessing economic conditions, I am cognizant of the structural challenges of slowing workforce growth due to an aging population and limitations on business pricing power due to technology and technology-enabled disruption as well as globalization.\n\nI am also highly attuned to the fact that, since early May, downside risks to the outlook have increased due to heightened trade tensions and decelerating rates of global growth. The economy is also being impacted by the waning of fiscal stimulus. The question is whether trade and global growth uncertainties are likely to persist in a manner that leads to a material deterioration in the outlook for U.S. economic growth.\n\nAt this stage, I believe it is too early to make a judgment on this question. These heightened uncertainties have intensified over the past seven weeks, and it is certainly possible that events could occur in the near future which would substantially reduce these uncertainties. In this situation, I believe it would be wise to allow events to unfold a bit more before making judgments regarding the stance of monetary policy. I think this approach would be particularly wise in light of the fact that, as mentioned earlier, my base case is for solid GDP growth in 2019, and I expect labor market conditions to remain at levels I would consider at or past full employment. In addition, financial conditions—the cost and availability of credit—are particularly robust by historical standards.\n\nAs I have said previously, monetary accommodation is not “free.” I am concerned that adding monetary stimulus, at this juncture, would contribute to a build-up of excesses and imbalances in the economy which may ultimately prove to be difficult and painful to manage.\n\nI have spoken about the level of corporate debt as potentially one of those excesses that is likely to be a “burden” on the economy in the event of a downturn. Persistently low interest rates make borrowing for share repurchase and merger transactions highly accretive to a company’s earnings per share. In a world where businesses have less and less pricing power and managing costs is essential, debt-financed activity becomes harder to resist. Debt-financed share repurchase and merger activity may help fuel growth in earnings per share when times are good, but in a downturn, increased debt levels will mean that a higher percentage of cash flow will be necessary to service interest and principal repayments. This is just one example of the type of excess that may seem innocuous when times are good but can become more troublesome in a downturn.\n\nIn this regard, I think it is important to emphasize that we are well-served by rigorous macroprudential policies, particularly tough capital requirements and stress testing for large banks as well as oversight of nonbank financials. In a period of persistently low interest rates, the potential exists for excesses and imbalances to build, and rigorous macroprudential oversight should provide more flexibility for monetary policy to deal primarily with economic conditions.\n\nI am closely monitoring the shape of the yield curve in the U.S. The three-month Treasury yield is today at 2.12 percent. In my view, the one-year Treasury at 1.93 percent, the five-year at 1.77 percent and the 10-year at 2.03 percent are indicative of sluggish expectations for future growth—and recent heightening of trade tensions has likely exacerbated these growth concerns.[29] It is important to emphasize that financial markets can change very rapidly and are highly sensitive not only to increased economic uncertainties, but also to expectations of Federal Reserve monetary policy actions.\n\nAs I have said before, I would be concerned about an inversion of the curve—either three-month to 10-year or one-year to 10-year—of some size and duration. My concern emanates from my belief that an inverted curve ultimately makes it more difficult for financial intermediaries to borrow short and lend long—and, if the inversion persists, it would likely begin to impede the creation of credit and lead to a tightening of financial conditions. I will continue to watch this carefully.\n\nI believe that we currently are in the neighborhood of a neutral setting for monetary policy—that is, we are likely neither accommodative nor restrictive. Over the coming weeks and months, I will be closely monitoring developments in the U.S. and global economies as well as the status of financial conditions (especially credit spreads and availability of credit). In particular, I intend to be highly vigilant with regard to the persistence of heightened trade tensions and indications that slowing global growth is spilling over into a material deterioration of the economic outlook for the U.S. In the meantime, I believe it would be wise to take additional time and allow events to unfold as we consider whether it is appropriate to make changes to the stance of U.S. monetary policy.\n\nIn 1989, President George H.W. Bush created the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP). It was more formally established by Congress in 1990 via the Global Change Research Act. The USGCRP was given the mandate to develop and coordinate “a comprehensive and integrated United States research program which will assist the Nation and the world to understand, assess, predict, and respond to human-induced and natural processes of global change.”[30]\n\nThe USGCRP is comprised of 13 federal agencies that conduct or use research on global change and its impact on society. These agencies include the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services, Interior, State and Transportation, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, National Science Foundation, Smithsonian Institution and U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nEvery four years, the USGCRP prepares an assessment, known as the National Climate Assessment (NCA). The NCA analyzes the effects of global change on the natural environment, agriculture, energy production and use, transportation, human health and biological diversity; and it describes current trends in global change and projects trends for the subsequent 25 to 100 years.\n\nThe most recent NCA was completed in November 2018 and was produced by a team of more than 300 experts, with input from external stakeholders. An expert external peer review of the report was performed by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.[31]\n\nThe NCA concludes “that the evidence of human-caused climate change is overwhelming and continues to strengthen, that the impacts of climate change are intensifying across the country, and that climate-related threats to Americans’ physical, social, and economic well-being are rising.”[32] The report cites “significant, clear, and compelling evidence that global average temperature is much higher, and is rising more rapidly, than anything modern civilization has experienced, with widespread and growing impacts.”[33]\n\nThe report also explains that greenhouse gases absorb heat in the atmosphere near the Earth’s surface, preventing it from escaping out into space. If the atmospheric concentrations of these gases rise, the average temperature of the lower atmosphere will gradually increase as the heat emitted by Earth is retained inside the climate system, warming the planet, a phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect.[34] Greenhouse gases include, for example, carbon dioxide, water vapor and methane.\n\nThe report cites studies which estimate that the global average temperature rose approximately 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit between 1901 and 2016,[35] and that for the period since 1986, global annual average temperatures appear to have increased at a more rapid rate than for any similar 20–30-year time period in at least the last 1,700 years.[36]\n\nThe NCA states that “annual average temperatures in the United States are projected to continue to increase in the coming decades.”[37] The report indicates that recent record-setting temperatures are expected to become common in the near future. By late this century, the report estimates that in the U.S., increases of 2.3°–6.7°F are expected under a relatively optimistic climate change scenario and 5.4°–11.0°F under a more dire scenario, relative to 1986–2015.[38]\n\nIn addition to temperature rise, the report suggests that we are likely to see further increases in ocean temperature as well as progressive melting in glaciers and ice sheets, some shrinking in snow cover and sea ice, rising sea levels, and more frequent high temperature extremes and heavy precipitation events.[39],[40]\n\nThe NCA argues that heavy rainfall events are associated with climate change. The report explains that, due to the relationships between levels of temperature and humidity, the frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall events are expected to increase over the coming century. The report asserts that warmer temperatures lead to increasing evaporation rates. This trend is likely to cause higher levels of water vapor in the atmosphere, which is likely to lead to more frequent and intense precipitation extremes.[41]\n\nThe NCA indicates that climate change has contributed to increases in Atlantic hurricane activity since 1970.[42] It also asserts that hurricane rainfall and intensity are projected to increase as a result of rises in sea surface temperatures and changes in atmospheric conditions.[43] While the frequency of tropical storms is not expected to change, the number of more-severe storms—those with sustained wind speeds in excess of 130 mph (referred to as Category 4 and 5 hurricanes)—is expected to increase.[44]\n\nThe report warns that U.S. coastal infrastructure could be adversely impacted by this trend. This infrastructure provides critical energy supplies and access to goods and services from overseas trade.[45] The report further highlights that reliable and affordable energy supplies, which support broad sectors of the U.S. economy, are increasingly at risk from climate change and weather extremes.[46]\n\nAcross much of the U.S., climate change is also expected to decrease surface soil moisture due to increased evaporation rates associated with warmer temperatures. This means that future droughts in certain regions of the U.S. are likely to be stronger and potentially last longer. The NCA explains that when droughts occur simultaneously with especially warm temperatures, it creates conditions for substantial wildfires, which have increased in frequency across the western U.S. since the 1980s.[47] Droughts can also have a significant impact on agriculture.\n\nFor a fuller explanation of the NCA report, please see the link, National Climate Assessment.\n\nHurricane Activity\n\nA hurricane is defined as a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of at least 74 mph. Since 2000, approximately 20 hurricanes have impacted the Gulf of Mexico region of the U.S., comprising Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida.[48] Over this period, 14 tropical storms passed through Texas, with six of these having sufficient maximum sustained winds to be categorized as hurricanes.\n\nThe NCA asserts that the intensity of hurricane activity is likely to increase. This trend is likely to be associated with greater rainfall during these severe storms.[49] In addition, the report indicates that climate change is likely to cause global sea levels to rise an average of 1–4 feet during the remainder of the 21st century.[50] As a result of rises in sea level, it is probable that the risk of flooding on the western Gulf of Mexico coast will increase.[51]\n\nThese developments could impact economic conditions in the Eleventh Federal Reserve District and U.S. because of the impact on coastal infrastructure, which connects the nation to energy supplies as well as access to goods and services from overseas trade. In addition, as a result of these trends, the costs to repair damage to Gulf Coast facilities are expected to grow substantially.[52]\n\nOne recent example of the impact of severe storms is Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall on Aug. 25, 2017, in the area just north of Corpus Christi, Texas. As Hurricane Harvey stalled over the Houston metro area, some areas recorded more than 50 inches of rain in a five-day period and experienced substantial flooding as local bayous, rivers and reservoirs overflowed their banks.[53]\n\nAccording to estimates by Moody’s Analytics, Hurricane Harvey had total direct costs of approximately $65 billion and indirect costs of approximately $8.5 billion.[54] Tragically, 68 people are estimated to have lost their lives as a direct result of the storm. More than 300,000 homes and businesses and approximately 500,000 cars were flooded.[55]\n\nHarvey led to an estimated 16,000 lost jobs in the Texas Gulf Coast region—however, the Dallas Fed estimates that as of the end of 2017, employment on the Gulf Coast had more than fully recovered.[56] While increased economic activity was associated with reconstruction efforts, there are more lingering impacts including lost homes and businesses, increased insurance costs and costs of government programs to mitigate future damages.\n\nAs discussed earlier, the Gulf Coast is home to a substantial concentration of refinery capacity, chemical industry infrastructure and offshore production facilities. At its peak, approximately 25 percent of the Gulf of Mexico’s offshore oil and natural gas production was shut in as a result of Harvey.[57] Refinery utilization along the Gulf Coast fell from in excess of 90 percent to approximately 60 percent.[58] More than 50 percent of U.S. output of basic petrochemicals was temporarily disrupted.[59] The refinery outages resulting from Harvey-related shutdowns led to a temporary increase in U.S. gasoline prices of 28 cents.[60]\n\nIn the aftermath of this storm, Gulf Coast cities as well as the state of Texas and various federal agencies have been working together to undertake multibillion-dollar investments to upgrade reservoir and flood mitigation infrastructure to better protect the region (residents and businesses) in the event of future weather events.\n\nImpact on Water Supplies, Flooding and Agriculture\n\nClimate change is expected to increase dryness in the Eleventh District as temperatures rise, as well as increase the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation.[61] For the agriculture sector, this increased weather variability will naturally lead to increased agricultural production variability and risk. These trends may also lead to challenges relating to water availability in the state.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, “drought is the leading driver of production risk in U.S. agriculture … [as it] can reduce crop yields, lead farmers to cut back planted or harvested acreage, reduce livestock productivity, and increase costs of production inputs such as animal feed or irrigation water.”[62] For the livestock sector—which accounts for more than 60 percent of agricultural production in Texas[63]—drought effects are often felt over multiple years due to the resulting pasture damage and herd reduction that take years to recover from.\n\nIn Texas, where farm employment makes up approximately 1.6 percent of employment, and farm output makes up approximately 0.4 percent of state GDP,[64] agricultural losses from the historic 2011 drought were estimated to be in excess of $7 billion, accounting for about 40 percent of the average value of agricultural production and far exceeding loss estimates from any prior drought on record.[65] Droughts also induce additional indirect effects from reduced agribusiness activity in drought years—fertilizer, crop storage, machinery—plus the decrease in expenditures in the local economy resulting from lost income for producers, harvest laborers, truck drivers and agribusinesses.\n\nHeavy precipitation, which is expected to continue to increase in both frequency and intensity as climate change progresses,[66] also causes problems for agriculture, as seen this year in Texas and in other parts of the country. When flooding happens early in the season, fields become too wet for farmers to prepare the soil and plant crops, causing delays which lead to reduced yields or crop substitution. Flooding late in the season causes harvest delays and crop quality issues, which both hamper farm income. Hotter temperatures prompted by climate change also pose additional pest problems for farmers, driving up pesticide use and costs, and hamper livestock productivity—increasing time to grow animals to a given weight and decreasing calving rates and milk production.[67]\n\nThe inherent risks in the agriculture industry may be exacerbated by climate change, which could make it more difficult for agricultural producers to get sufficient financing and insurance. As crop yields become more variable, lenders may become more concerned about repayment of crop production loans and tighten their lending standards and terms. Also, insurance costs will go up as insurers have more indemnities to pay out from droughts or floods. Adaptations in the agricultural sector to mitigate the impact of drought cycles include planting more drought-resistant crops, increasing irrigation, and technological advances in water retention and irrigation application. In Texas, we may see a shift to more cotton acreage, as cotton can tolerate more heat than grain crops and has a wider time frame for planting and harvesting, which is beneficial in times of flooding.\n\nBesides increased hurricane intensity and greater risk of drought, climate change may have additional impacts that could affect our district. Increased temperatures are likely to have an adverse effect on people’s health and quality of life.[68] They will likely lead to increased water evaporation and soil moisture deterioration, as well as aquifer drawdowns.[69] Increased ocean acidity and warming will affect aquatic life, impacting the commercial and recreational fishing industries along the Gulf Coast.[70]\n\nThe purpose of this appendix has been to lay out key elements of the National Climate Assessment and discuss some of the potential implications of severe weather events for the Eleventh District. Dallas Fed economists will continue to carefully monitor and consider the impact of climate change on economic and financial conditions in the district and the nation.\n\nNotes",

            "content": "In our May 2019 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left the federal funds rate unchanged in a range of 2.25 to 2.5 percent. In the post-meeting statement, we commented that, on a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have declined and are running below 2 percent. The statement also noted that we “continue to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes.”\n\nHeadline personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure, has been running below our 2 percent target for a substantial portion of the time period since 2012.[1] At the Dallas Fed, we particularly focus on the Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean measure of core PCE inflation, which filters out extreme upside and downside moves in inflation components. We believe this measure is a useful indicator of underlying inflation trends. The trimmed mean is currently running at approximately 2.0 percent on a trailing 12-month basis and has been in a range of 1.4 to 2.0 percent over the past seven years.[2]\n\nThe unemployment rate is currently 3.6 percent and has been below the Congressional Budget Office estimate of full employment for two years.[3] At the Dallas Fed, we particularly focus on the U-6 measure of unemployment, which measures the level of unemployed, plus “marginally attached workers” who indicate that they would like a job but have stopped looking for one, plus people working part time who would prefer to work full time. This measure now stands at 7.3 percent, and is below its 2006 prerecession low of approximately 7.9 percent.[4]\n\nDallas Fed economists expect GDP growth of approximately 2.25 percent in 2019. While this is slower growth than in 2018, it should be sufficient to further tighten the labor market and cause the rate of wage growth to modestly pick up over the course of 2019. Our economists also expect that, despite some recent weakness in headline and core inflation readings, the headline PCE and Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean measure of core PCE inflation are likely to firm, ending the year in the range of 2 percent.\n\nSome observers have suggested that, with this tight of a labor market, there should be greater wage pressure than the 3.2 percent recent reading of average hourly earnings growth over the past year.[5] They argue that they would have expected wage pressure to have translated into greater price pressure. As most of you know, the Fed has initiated a review of its framework and communication strategy to explore whether there are actions we could take to improve our ability to achieve and maintain our dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nWith all this as background, and in light of our ongoing framework review, I thought it would make sense to step back and explore some of the potential issues raised by recent weakness in headline and core inflation measures. In particular, I will focus my remarks on labor slack, inflation expectations, and structural forces with regard to how they may be impacting the Fed’s ability to meets its 2 percent inflation objective.\n\nA number of economists have argued that there may be more slack in the U.S. labor market than standard measurements are capturing. They believe that there may be more scope to attract and retain previously under-represented groups in the workforce. To support this argument, it is worth noting that, since 2015, increases in labor force participation have disproportionately come from under-represented groups. For example, the participation rate of the prime-age female population with less than a high school education has increased significantly, as has the participation rate for black males and Hispanic females.[6]\n\nIt is also worth noting that the prime-age labor force participation rate in 2018 was 82.0 percent versus 83.1 percent in 2008 and 84.1 percent in 1998.[7] If we compare U.S. prime-age labor force participation to other developed countries, we find that the U.S. participation rate lags behind many of these countries, although this gap has begun to close somewhat since early 2015.\n\n\n\nDownloadable chart | Chart data\n\nIs it possible that the strength of the labor market is drawing in workers who have been on the sidelines—particularly under-represented groups—and is also encouraging workers to stay in the labor force?[8] Is it possible that improvements in skills training, child care availability and transportation availability have drawn, and could still draw, more sidelined workers back into the workforce—and keep them in the workforce?\n\nIt’s important to recognize that gains in labor force participation act to slow the decline of the unemployment rate. Additionally, recent research—including work done by Richard Crump, Stefano Eusepi, Marc Giannoni and Ayşegül Şahin—has argued that changes in demographics, especially the aging of the workforce, the aging of firms, as well as the increase in the attachment of women to the labor force, may have contributed to a decline in the natural rate of unemployment.[9]\n\nIf this is the case, we may look back five years from now and conclude that the natural rate of unemployment was simply lower than we had been historically accustomed, and that one of the reasons for the perceived surprising lack of inflation pressure was due to an excessively high estimate of the equilibrium level of unemployment. In this explanation, the Phillips curve may be alive and well, but the intercept is simply lower than we have previously understood. If this is true, central bankers need to be vigilant to the possibility that there is still the potential for inflation readings to firm substantially, with a time lag, if the degree of full employment overshoot becomes more sizeable and persists for an extended period of time.\n\nAnother debate relates to the Fed’s ability to manage longer-run inflation expectations. As you all know, the Fed has clearly articulated a 2 percent PCE inflation target. Many would argue that the Fed has done a reasonably good job in helping to anchor inflation expectations. They would cite the fact that surveys of professional forecasters’ inflation expectations are close to 2 percent, and they would suggest that this is not a coincidence; it is a reflection of the Federal Open Market Committee’s policy actions and communications, which have been aimed at achieving and maintaining full employment while anchoring longer-run inflation expectations at our 2 percent objective.\n\nHowever, other economists contend that, due to an extended period of inflation running below our 2 percent target, expectations may have drifted somewhat lower. This downward drift might be reflected in the University of Michigan survey for inflation expectations over the next five years, which has gone from an average of 2.9 percent in 2013 to 2.5 percent in the 12 months ending April 2019.[10] These economists argue that the Fed may need to do more to help keep inflation expectations well-anchored. In particular, has the Fed done enough to convince the public that it is committed to a symmetrical 2 percent inflation target? Are there changes to the Fed’s policy framework, communication strategy or other actions the Fed could take to help better anchor inflation expectations at the Fed’s 2 percent target?\n\nAn additional area of exploration deals with structural changes in the U.S. and global economies. In particular, are the forces of technology, technology-enabled disruption and, to some extent, globalization, limiting the pricing power of businesses and muting inflation?\n\nDallas Fed economists recognize that we are living through a period of acceleration in the trend of technology replacing people. We are also seeing the proliferation of new models for selling goods and services—often technology-enabled (think Amazon, Airbnb, Uber or Lyft)—that replace traditional models for delivering these goods and services. These new models are often enabling consumers to buy products and services at prices that are dramatically below those of incumbent competitors. To take advantage of this trend, large-platform companies are increasingly bundling products and services—sometimes with little or no gross margin—in order to gain market share.\n\nAll this is being facilitated by the fact that the consumer now has in the palm of his or her hand more computing power than most companies did just 15 years ago. Consumers are able to use this new technology to shop for goods and services at lower prices, often with greater convenience.\n\nThe impact of these trends means that companies, depending on the industry, often have much less pricing power than they did historically. In response, companies are investing even more in technology that replaces people and, increasingly, taking actions to achieve greater scale in order to effectively manage the investment and margin implications of these trends. The net result is that, in a range of industries, if there is wage pressure, companies are just as likely to see margin erosion versus being able to pass these costs on to the customer.\n\nAs a result of these trends, we are seeing a record level of merger activity by companies in order to get more scale to compete in this environment.[11] Companies are using increased debt issuance to fund merger activities to achieve greater scale and are also using increased debt issuance to fund accretive share repurchases in order to soften the margin dilution they are experiencing.[12] Activist investors are increasingly pressuring companies to take steps to merge and fund accretive share repurchases or face replacement of their boards of directors and/or their executive teams.\n\nThe workforce is also experiencing the impact of this trend. Highly educated and skilled workers are often seeing the benefits of technology and disruption—depending on their company or industry. However, those workers with a high school education or less—who lack specific skills training—are increasingly seeing their jobs restructured or eliminated. This is leading to increasing wealth and income inequality.\n\nThis discussion would suggest that powerful structural changes in the economy may be an important aspect of more muted price pressures. Further, there may be some evidence in recent productivity statistics that new technology and greater economies of scale could be helping to dampen growth in unit labor costs.\n\nThe Fed’s 2 percent inflation target is symmetrical—that is, we don’t want inflation to run persistently below or above our 2 percent target. Sustained deviations from our inflation target could increase the likelihood that inflation expectations begin to drift or become unanchored. This could, in turn, make it more difficult for the Fed to achieve its dual-mandate objectives of full employment and price stability.\n\nIn this context, the various issues raised in this essay merit further discussion and attention. As the Federal Reserve conducts its ongoing review of our monetary policy framework and communication strategy, the challenge will be to explore potential options for enhancing our policy approach so that we can better achieve our dual-mandate objectives.",

            "content": "As a central bank policymaker, I closely monitor various types of excesses and imbalances that may be developing in the economy. One of the areas I monitor is the level and growth of indebtedness in the household, government and corporate sectors. In previous essays, I have commented on the positive impacts of the deleveraging of the household sector since the Great Recession, and I have raised a cautionary flag regarding the growth of U.S. government debt, including a substantial increase in the present value of unfunded entitlements.\n\nThe purpose of this essay is to focus on trends in corporate debt growth and credit quality in the U.S. and discuss potential implications for economic conditions and financial stability.\n\nIn the decade since the Great Recession, there has been an improvement in household balance sheets. In particular, it is estimated that household debt declined from 97 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) at year-end 2008 to approximately 75 percent as of Sept. 30, 2018.[1] This trend has been aided by a strong jobs market and improving wage growth. This household deleveraging is very important because consumer spending is approximately 70 percent of U.S. GDP.[2]\n\nWhile household balance sheets have improved, the U.S. government has become more highly indebted. Government debt (primarily in the form of Treasury obligations) held by the public as a percentage of GDP has grown from 44 percent at year-end 2008 to approximately 77 percent as of Dec. 31, 2018.[3] In addition, the present value of unfunded entitlements now stands at approximately $54 trillion.[4] This growing level of government debt as a percentage of GDP means, at a minimum, there is less capacity for infrastructure spending and other investments which might help build the productive capability of the U.S. economy. It also means that in the next downturn, there is likely to be less capacity for fiscal stimulus.\n\nHistorically, the U.S. government has tended to reduce its degree of leverage when the economy is strong—that has not been the case this cycle. At the later stages of a long economic expansion, recent fiscal actions have had the impact of increasing government debt to GDP and have provided meaningful stimulus to near-term growth. It is our view at the Dallas Fed that the current path of government debt to GDP is unlikely to be sustainable—and if we need to find ways to moderate our debt growth in the future, this moderation is likely to create headwinds for GDP growth.\n\nIn addition to household and government debt, Dallas Fed economists also keep track of the level and growth of corporate debt in the financial sector as well as the nonfinancial sector of the U.S. economy. On the positive side, U.S. financial sector debt has declined substantially from near its historical peak of approximately 124 percent of GDP at the end of 2008 to 78 percent as of Sept. 30, 2018.[5] This decline was accompanied by substantially more stringent postcrisis financial sector regulations and oversight intended to reduce the systemic risk and improve the resiliency of the U.S. financial sector.\n\nBy contrast, U.S. nonfinancial corporate debt as a percentage of GDP is now higher than the prior peak reached at the end of 2008. As seen in Chart 1, U.S. nonfinancial corporate debt as a percentage of GDP declined substantially in the aftermath of the Great Recession, but then rebounded from a postrecession low of approximately 40 percent in 2010 to 46 percent as of Sept. 30, 2018.[6],[7]\n\n\n\nDownloadable chart\n\nThis rebound in the amount of nonfinancial corporate debt is something I am carefully considering in assessing economic conditions and financial stability in the U.S. In particular, it is worth noting that a number of research studies have indicated that relatively higher levels of corporate debt to GDP could potentially amplify the severity of a recession.[8] Several of these papers also suggest that strong growth in corporate debt to GDP is more likely to amplify a downturn when corporate leverage is historically elevated, as it is today.[9]\n\nNonfinancial corporate debt consists primarily of bonds and loans (commercial paper outstanding is less than 5 percent of the total). Nonfinancial corporate bonds outstanding in the U.S. grew from approximately $2.2 trillion in 2008 to approximately $5.7 trillion at year-end 2018 (Chart 2). The bulk of this growth occurred in the investment-grade sector. The amount of outstanding U.S. investment-grade nonfinancial corporate bonds grew from approximately $1.5 trillion in 2008 to $4.5 trillion at year-end 2018.[10]\n\nWithin the investment-grade sector, there was a notable increase in the amount of BBB bonds (the lowest level of investment-grade debt) outstanding, growing from approximately $0.8 trillion in 2008 to $2.7 trillion by year-end 2018.[11] In addition, the amount of high-yield (less than investment grade) nonfinancial corporate bonds outstanding grew from approximately $0.7 trillion in 2008 to $1.1 trillion by year-end 2018. This substantial growth in BBB and lower-rated bonds is indicative of a weakening in corporate credit quality in the U.S.\n\nIt is estimated that a substantial portion of the increase in nonfinancial corporate debt was used to fund share buybacks, dividends and merger activity.[12] This trend has been accompanied by more relaxed bond and loan covenants,[13] which have had the effect of reducing protections for investors.\n\n\n\nDownloadable chart\n\nThere has also been an increase in syndicated leveraged loans over this period. Leveraged loans are loans made to highly indebted companies and are typically originated by commercial banks and then syndicated to nonbank investors, including special-purpose vehicles such as collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), private equity funds and other stand-alone entities. The size of the syndicated leveraged loan market, which is primarily made up of nonfinancial corporate borrowers, has increased from $0.6 trillion at the end of 2008 to $1.2 trillion at year-end 2018.[14] Much of this increase has occurred to fund corporate acquisitions and private-equity-backed transactions.[15]\n\nIn addition to the syndicated leveraged loan market, there is also a direct lending market for leveraged loans in the U.S. This market primarily involves nonbank financial firms—such as asset managers, private equity funds, business development corporations (BDCs), hedge funds, insurance companies and pension funds—lending directly to smaller, mid-market companies. While it is difficult to obtain precise information on the size of this market, Standard and Poor’s (S&P) estimates that the amount of outstanding leveraged loans in the U.S. direct lending market has grown significantly over the past several years and now likely exceeds several hundred billion dollars.[16]\n\nCLOs are investment vehicles that buy pools of floating-rate leveraged loans from banks. The CLO packages loans into tranches of debt with credit ratings ranging from AAA to BB and with one nonrated tranche of equity, as illustrated in Chart 3. These tranches are securitized and then sold primarily to institutional investors.\n\n\n\nDownloadable chart\n\nThe ability of a CLO to turn lower-credit-quality loans into mostly investment-grade-rated bonds via securitization hinges on three key factors: 1) overcollateralization, 2) tranching of securities based on levels of subordination, and 3) portfolio diversification. As loans are paid off, the income flows to the buyers of the CLO securities. In case of a default in one of the underlying loans, the lowest tranche (equity) is the first to experience a loss, whereas the AAA tranche would be the last to experience a loss. Unlike mortgage-backed securities, the CLO structure proved relatively resilient during 2008–09.\n\nThe U.S. CLO market has grown from roughly $300 billion at the end of 2008 to $615 billion at the end of 2018.[17] However, it is important to recognize that CLO loan-credit quality today is estimated to be somewhat weaker than 10 years ago.\n\nS&P estimates that in 2018, CLOs and loan mutual funds purchased approximately 60 percent and 20 percent, respectively, of syndicated leveraged loan volumes. It is estimated that less than 10 percent of new issuance was purchased by banks in the U.S. The remaining volumes were purchased by insurance companies, finance companies and others.[18] Because CLOs are today the largest buyer of these syndicated leveraged loans, disruptions to CLO creation could increase the likelihood that leveraged loans remain on bank balance sheets, which could, in turn, limit the ability of affected banks to extend credit during periods of stress.\n\nAs a central banker, I am carefully tracking the growth in BBB and less-than-investment-grade debt. In the event of a downturn, highly indebted companies may be more vulnerable to seeing their credit quality deteriorate, which could negatively impact their capital spending and hiring plans. If this deterioration were sufficiently widespread, credit spreads would likely widen in order to compensate lenders/bondholders for greater risk. This type of widening would likely be indicative of an overall tightening in financial conditions that could, in turn, lead to a more significant slowing in the economy.\n\nIn a downturn, some proportion of BBB bonds may be at risk of being downgraded to less than investment grade. These downgrades, if they happen in sufficient size, could create dislocations for investors who tend to have specific allocations or restrictions based on credit-rating categories. These dislocations could further negatively impact credit spreads and market access for more highly indebted companies.\n\nOne further issue is whether there is sufficient liquidity in the various corporate debt markets. Ample liquidity is particularly important in the event of market stress or dislocation.\n\nWhile there is debate regarding the evidence of a decline in various measures of corporate bond market liquidity—such as round-trip trading costs, bid–ask spreads or turnover[19]—it is generally agreed that bank-affiliated broker-dealers have been committing less capital to corporate bond trading since the financial crisis. In particular, it is estimated that inventories of corporate debt held by broker-dealers declined from $29.2 billion at the end of 2013 to $14.2 billion at the end of 2018.[20]\n\nThis decline is notable given that the total corporate bond market increased 36 percent over this period. The decline in inventories held by broker-dealers may be due, at least in part, to postcrisis regulation, such as the Volcker rule (effective April 2014), as well as the growth in electronic trading and other market-related factors.[21]\n\nIn the event of an economic downturn and some credit-quality deterioration, the reduction in bank broker-dealer inventories and market-making capability could mean that credit spreads might widen more significantly, and potentially in a more volatile manner, than they have historically. This concern may be somewhat heightened in light of the rapid growth in BBB and lower-rated securities issuance over the past 10 years.\n\nI will continue to closely monitor the level, growth and credit quality of corporate debt. Vigilance is warranted as these issues have the potential to impact corporate investment and spending plans. In the event of an economic downturn, these issues could also contribute to a deterioration in financial conditions which could, in turn, amplify the severity of a growth slowdown in the U.S. economy.\n\nI am also sensitive to these corporate debt developments in light of the historically high level of U.S. government debt and the forward estimates for the path of government debt to GDP. An elevated level of corporate debt, along with the high level of U.S. government debt, is likely to mean that the U.S. economy is much more interest rate sensitive than it has been historically.",

            "content": "In the January 2019 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left the federal funds rate unchanged in a range of 2.25 to 2.5 percent and communicated that it “will be patient” as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate.\n\nThe FOMC also issued a “Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization,” which reflects our decision to continue to implement monetary policy in a regime in which control over the level of the federal funds rate is exercised via a so-called “floor system” with an ample supply of reserves.[1] The Committee also said that it is prepared to adjust any of the details for completing balance sheet normalization in light of economic and financial developments.\n\nThe FOMC began the process of gradually reducing the size of its balance sheet in the fall of 2017. Through January, the Fed has reduced its balance sheet by approximately $400 billion.\n\nThe U.S. economy, as measured by real gross domestic product (GDP), is estimated to have grown approximately 3 percent in 2018. However, various economic and financial uncertainties have emerged over the past several months. I believe that these developments merit close monitoring—and have the potential to impact the economic outlook.\n\nAfter approximately 115 months of economic expansion and nine federal funds rate increases over the past three years, I believe that we are at a critical juncture in terms of monetary policy. It is my view that the Fed should be exhibiting patience. In particular, I believe that we should take no further action on the federal funds rate until there is greater clarity regarding a number of uncertainties relating to the economic outlook and development of financial conditions.\n\nIn addition, consistent with our January “Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization,” I believe it is highly appropriate for us to be open to adjusting the details of our normalization plans based on our ongoing assessments of the economic outlook and financial conditions. My FOMC colleagues and I will continue to analyze and discuss the appropriate size and composition of the balance sheet—and will be working toward making decisions on these issues over the coming months.\n\nU.S. economic growth in 2018 was aided by sizable fiscal stimulus and strong consumer spending. Additionally, for much of the year, business fixed investment and solid global growth provided tailwinds to U.S. GDP growth.\n\nBased on underlying employment data as well as discussions with business contacts, it is my view that the U.S. labor market is extremely tight by historical standards. The unemployment rate in December was 3.9 percent, and the U-6 rate was 7.6 percent. This U-6 reading was lower than the prerecession low of 7.9 percent in 2006 (U-6 comprises the unemployed, plus “marginally attached workers” who indicate that they would like a job but have stopped looking for one, plus people working part time who would prefer to work full time).\n\nIn January, the unemployment rate increased to 4.0 percent, and U-6 jumped to 8.1 percent. The labor force participation rate increased to 63.2 percent. Dallas Fed economists have cautioned that the January increase in the unemployment rate and the substantial rise in U-6 were likely influenced by the partial federal government shutdown and may well reverse in the coming months. In particular, we would note the unusual jump in the number of people working part time who would prefer to work full time; this measure increased by approximately 500,000 and may reflect, at least in part, government workers and contractors seeking alternative employment during the shutdown.\n\nI believe that the Federal Reserve is meeting its inflation mandate. The most recent reading of the Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean, our preferred measure of core inflation, was approximately 2 percent for the 12 months ending in November. This measure, which exes out extreme price movements to the upside and downside, provides a reliable gauge of underlying inflation trends. Given the tightness in the labor market, it is noteworthy that core inflation has not risen more sharply.\n\nMy own view is that the structural forces of automation and technology-enabled disruption as well as globalization are limiting the pricing power of businesses and having a dampening effect on inflation. It is also my view that while cyclical inflationary pressures have been building due to a tightening labor market, the impact of these structural forces is also intensifying. Based on these cross-currents, I expect inflationary pressures to remain somewhat muted; I don’t expect inflation to run away from us.\n\nAs we begin 2019, I see several cautionary signs that bear close scrutiny. First, global growth is decelerating. For example, China’s purchasing managers indexes have continued to weaken, and the European Central Bank has continued to downgrade its projections for economic growth in the euro zone for 2019. While the world economy (excluding the U.S.) grew 3.4 percent in 2017, growth is estimated to have declined to 3.0 percent in 2018 and is expected to further decline to 2.7 percent in 2019.[2] Measures of world export growth and industrial production (excluding the U.S.) also decelerated during 2018.\n\nIt is my view that slowing economic growth outside the U.S. has the potential to ultimately spill over into economic growth in the U.S. I am particularly mindful of the fact that approximately 45 percent of S&P 500 company revenues come from outside the United States and that a variety of U.S. industries rely heavily on exports to China, Europe and other regions of the world. Slower economic growth outside the U.S. means that there is less foreign demand for goods and services originating in the U.S. In addition, a substantial number of U.S. companies are highly reliant on global logistics and supply-chain arrangements. If those arrangements are more uncertain due to trade tensions, this can create challenges for domestic firms in managing profit margins and have a chilling effect on capital spending plans by these firms.\n\nIn the U.S., interest-sensitive industries are showing signs of weakness. As of November, new single-family building permits were down 4.3 percent from their February 2018 expansion peak. Sales of existing single-family homes, which hit 5.05 million in November 2017, were down 11.9 percent to 4.45 million as of December 2018.\n\nRecent national and regional surveys of manufacturing activity also indicate signs of slowing. The Institute for Supply Management manufacturing index indicated meaningfully slower growth in December and, to a lesser extent, January. This slowing was also reflected in Federal Reserve Bank surveys from the Dallas, Kansas City, New York and Richmond regions.\n\nIn addition, recent surveys of consumer sentiment have fallen. In January, the Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index fell to its lowest level since July 2017, and the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index declined to its lowest level since October 2016, attributed in part to concerns about the partial federal government shutdown.\n\nIt is the view of our economists at the Dallas Fed that the negative impact of the recent shutdown on economic activity and unemployment should substantially reverse in the coming months—this, of course, assumes the shutdown does not resume in the coming weeks. Our judgment doesn’t take into account any heightening of business and consumer uncertainty that might persist as a result of the shutdown.\n\nSince early October, financial conditions in the U.S. have tightened. For example, high-yield spreads increased from approximately 3.15 percent to 5.30 percent between early October and December 31, and then retraced somewhat to approximately 4.40 percent by January 31. U.S. high-yield corporate bond issuance declined 39 percent in 2018. The average level of monthly high-yield issuance was approximately $16.9 billion through October 2018 but declined to $3.6 billion in November and $0.6 billion in December before rebounding to approximately $19.9 billion in January.\n\nFor the past year, Dallas Fed economists have expected that 2019 growth would slow from 2018 levels. We expected this slowing due to waning fiscal stimulus heading into 2019 as well as the impact of Federal Reserve rate increases that tend to impact the economy with a lag. We have also highlighted the powerful structural headwinds of slowing workforce growth due to aging of the population as well as sluggish productivity growth due in part to lagging education and skill levels in the U.S.\n\nSince early December, Dallas Fed economists have lowered our base-case forecast for 2019 GDP growth to approximately 2 percent. Of course, we are cognizant of ongoing risks to this outlook that include trade tensions as well as the other uncertainties discussed earlier.\n\nI believe the Federal Reserve has made good progress in achieving its dual-mandate objectives of maximum sustainable employment and price stability. In addition, we have made progress in normalizing monetary policy and in reducing the size of our balance sheet.\n\nI am mindful of the fact that GDP growth is made up of growth in the workforce plus growth in productivity. The current economic expansion has now lasted for nearly 10 years, and we are likely somewhat late in the business cycle, with relatively less spare labor-force capacity to help support continued robust growth.\n\nI believe that the Treasury yield curve is sending cautionary signals regarding expectations for medium- and longer-term GDP growth. These sluggish expectations are reflective of key structural headwinds discussed in this as well as previous essays, which include: 1) aging-population demographics that are likely creating slower workforce growth, 2) limited improvements in productivity growth due in part to lagging education and skill levels in the U.S., and 3) high levels of corporate and federal government debt in the U.S. that are stimulative on the way up but can create impediments to growth if debt levels need to be moderated. Further, it is our view at the Dallas Fed that globalization is likely an opportunity to achieve higher levels of economic growth and that some resolution of current trade tensions is critical to seizing this opportunity.\n\nBased on these various factors, and in light of the uncertainties described in this note, I believe it would be prudent for the Fed to exercise patience and refrain from taking further action on the federal funds rate until the economic outlook becomes somewhat clearer. I expect we will get some further clarity during the first half of 2019.\n\nIn addition, it is my expectation that inflation readings will remain somewhat muted in 2019. As I mentioned earlier, it is my view that the structural forces of automation, technology-enabled disruption and globalization will continue to offset, at least in part, the cyclical pressures created by a historically tight labor market. As a result, I believe the Fed has the luxury of being patient over the next several months. Exercising patience will be critical if we are to achieve our dual-mandate objectives of maximum sustainable employment and price stability.",

            "content": "December 3, 2014 Dallas\n\nThank you, Alden [McCall]. I feel right at home in a room full of MBAs. As many of you know, I am not a PhD economist like the majority of my colleagues sitting on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). I admire my colleagues tremendously for their intellectual capacity and their well-trained insights into the dismal science of economics and the arcana of monetary policy, but I am proud of just being an MBA. I was privileged to attend all those schools Alden mentioned: the Naval Academy, Harvard and Oxford. But I feel that the MBA program at Stanford Business School prepared me best for my career as a banker, a money market operator, and for the past decade, a policymaker at the Federal Reserve. (Though plebe year at Annapolis probably best equipped me for the sleep deprivation and the pressure we operated under during the financial crisis). So Alden, I begin with a tip of the hat to the MBAs you have assembled this evening.\n\nI am going to talk about Texas tonight, this being my annual report on the status of the Texas economy. I will walk you through a series of slides that illustrate the strength of the Texas economy, a series of economic records we have set this year, and to provide a balanced view, some of the growing pains that we are encountering. But first, I want to make a comment on monetary policy.\n\nThinking Outside the Box\n\nIt strikes me as timely for the Fed to consider implementing one of the possible options under the “normalization principles” the FOMC articulated in September: allowing our security holdings to run off as the bonds in our massive portfolio mature.[1] Before you jump out of your skin at this “radical” thought, let me ask you to consider the following.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury note has rallied in price and declined in yield to 2.29 percent. German 10-year bunds, the equivalent market-anchoring European security, are trading to yield 0.74 percent; the Japanese 10-year yields 0.42 percent. The spread between the U.S. and the German sovereign yields is slightly narrower than it was at the end of third quarter 2014, but it remains historically large and attractive for investors.[2] Hold that thought.\n\nNow, if you read page C3 of today’s Wall Street Journal, specifically the article titled “Watchdog Warns of Risks in Markets” about the risks of a repeat of the bond market turmoil of October and concerns about market stability as seen through the eyes of the Office of Financial Research (a bureaucracy of some 225 people and growing, created by the Dodd-Frank law), you would have noted the following sentences: “A reduction in securities that are available to lend against in financial markets—such as Treasury bonds and asset-backed securities—also is fueling...volatility. The securitization markets have shrunk since the financial crisis and the Federal Reserve has further reduced the amount of available securities by snapping up trillions of dollars in bonds in recent years.” Let me repeat that last clause: The Federal Reserve has further reduced the amount of available securities by snapping up trillions of dollars in bonds in recent years. To be precise, $1.7 trillion of Treasuries and asset-backed securities were purchased under QE3, on top of the $2 trillion purchased under the previous rounds of quantitative easing.\n\nTo be sure, we have instituted programs to counter this problem: We have developed sophisticated operations whereby we sell assets in our portfolio and promise to buy them back at a later period. This is known as our overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility, and its net effect is to shift longer-term securities out of our portfolio and into the hands of market operators. This has expanded the traditional reach of our New York desk, where the aggregate portfolios of the 12 Federal Reserve banks are traded under directives given it by the FOMC. Thus the Fed's reach—some would say intrusion—into trading markets has been expanded.\n\nNow, let's bring together these observations with the thought I asked you to hold earlier. It strikes me that given current circumstances, it would do no harm to start slowly trimming our holdings by letting them roll off as they mature. My sense is that presently, we could do this:\n\nMind you, the above proposition does not imply any rush to raise the fed funds rate or its equivalents, such as the rate on excess reserves. That will depend on progress made toward meeting our dual objectives of maintaining price stability around the FOMC’s 2 percent target while facilitating full employment. Nor should it be interpreted as a criticism of the very able people we have on the trading desk: I hold them in highest regard; they perform their duty admirably. It simply is addressed at seizing the moment to kill three birds with one stone and do so with minimum violence to the market.\n\nOf course, a more effective way to put collateral back into the market would be to sell outright a carefully measured portion of our portfolio. There could even be room for the market to stomach this in its current condition. But in my opinion, this might be too radical a departure from the exit principles we announced and would risk undermining confidence in the FOMC.\n\nThis is my personal view. I realize it represents thinking “outside the box.” But in my final four months at the Fed, I plan to urge my colleagues to think more outside the box in this and other ways in the interest of securing sound money, a sound economy and sound markets.\n\nAnd now to some Texas brag.\n\nTexas Brag\n\nAllow me to walk you through some charts and comment on each on them.\n\nThank you. And now in the great tradition of central bankers, I would be happy to avoid answering any questions you and your colleagues might have.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nNotes",

            "content": "November 3, 2014 New York City\n\nThank you, Mickey [Levy], for that colorful introduction.\n\nUnless you have been living under a rock (and no one in this audience looks like a cave dweller), you know that on Wednesday of last week, the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) ended its program of purchasing Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Thus endeth QE3.\n\nMay it rest in peace.\n\nEffects and Efficacy of QE3\n\nUnder QE3, the FOMC directed the New York Fed’s trading desk to purchase a total of $1.7 trillion in longer-term Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, on top of the $2 trillion invested in the first two rounds of quantitative easing. When we started the first tranche of asset purchases in late 2008, our balance sheet had footings of around $900 billion; as the third and final round of quantitative easing ends, our balance sheet has reached $4.5 trillion.\n\nThe initial impetus for MBS purchases was a wide gap between MBS and Treasury yields, symptomatic of a dysfunctional mortgage-finance market. The Federal Reserve responded by purchasing $1.3 trillion in MBS and agency debt as part of QE1, the program of balance-sheet expansion that ran from late 2008 through the spring of 2010. Holdings of MBS and agency debt were then allowed to run off and by September 2011 had fallen to a little under $1 trillion. Holdings were stabilized at that level when proceeds from maturing agency securities and MBS began to be reinvested in MBS, starting October 2011.\n\nThe renewed expansion of MBS holdings that began in October 2012 as part of QE3 was motivated less by any sense that the mortgage-finance market was dysfunctional than by the notion that normal frictions in that market potentially provided monetary policy with leverage to stimulate the housing sector—and thus the economy as a whole—at a time when more-traditional policy tools had been exhausted. The FOMC majority pushed aside concerns that providing targeted support to housing is more properly the province of fiscal policy, and voted to proceed. From the start of QE3 to its conclusion, the Fed’s portfolio of agency securities and MBS expanded by about $850 billion. In the latest version of its normalization principles, released this September, the FOMC indicated that it expects to reduce its holdings in future years primarily through attrition.\n\nWhat of the expansion of the Federal Reserve’s holdings of longer-term Treasury securities under QE3? Fed purchases of longer-term Treasuries amount to nothing more than the transformation of long-term Treasury obligations into short-term obligations of the Federal Reserve. Essentially, long-term government obligations are transformed into short-term government obligations. The government benefits from lower interest costs in the near term, but its future net revenues become more sensitive to future interest-rate increases. Government finance problems are reduced today, at a cost of potential future problems. The larger bank reserves become, the greater is the government’s future interest-rate exposure.\n\nChairman Ben Bernanke famously said that “the problem with QE is that it works in practice, but it doesn’t work in theory”—QE3 seemed to succeed in pushing interest rates lower out along the yield curve, energizing the bond market and lowering the hurdle rate for discounting cash flows and earnings of companies whose shares traded in stock markets.[1] This came, of course, at the expense of savers who kept their money in the most basic of short-term investments. But this was a cost that the committee felt was exceeded by the expected wealth effect.\n\nWell before last week’s FOMC meeting, it seemed to me that QE3’s effectiveness had waned while its current and potential future costs were mounting. I was thus an enthusiastic supporter of killing the program.\n\nIndeed, I would rather we had never had QE3 in the first place. To this day, I feel that the costs of accumulating another $1.7 trillion of Treasuries and MBS will be shown to exceed the benefits. And yet, as I have said on countless occasions, drawing on former Dallas Fed board Chairman Herb Kelleher’s love for bourbon, once we had QE3 in place, I considered it unwise to go directly from Wild Turkey to cold turkey for fear of getting the financial equivalent of delirium tremens; indeed, we saw that with the “taper tantrum” the markets threw in May of 2013. So I was an eager proponent of the tapering program the FOMC initiated in January of this year.\n\nI want to be clear here. Especially at the beginning of QE3, when the nonsense term “QE infinity” was being broadcast by otherwise responsible analysts, journalists and pundits, rates dipped to lows that helped creditworthy businesses bolster their balance sheets and strengthen their wherewithal for future expansion. Again, even if you were living under a rock, you know that this gift of near-cost-free debt as measured in inflation- and tax-adjusted terms has thus far been used primarily to finance stock buybacks, increase dividends and fatten cash reserves, and recently, finance mergers by the most creditworthy companies. For those with access to capital, it was a gift of free money to speculate with. (One wag—I believe it was me—quipped that there was, indeed, a “positive wealth effect… the wealthy were affected most positively.”)\n\nWe know that monetary policy acts with long and variable lags. That characterization applies, in spades, to the unorthodox policy we have pursued at the zero bound, in terms of achieving full employment and hitting our 2 percent inflation target.\n\nTogether with the healthy rejuvenation of the balance sheets and equity prices of investment grade companies, we have seen what I consider to be a manifestation of an indiscriminate reach for yield, a revival of covenant-free lending, and an explosion of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), pathologies that have proved harbingers of eventual financial turbulence.\n\nNoticeably affected by QE3 have been the nominal yield levels of subpar credits and their spreads relative to investment-grade issues. Some 40 percent of newly issued CCC credits have negative cash flows.[2] And yet “junk” bonds have been trading at or near record historic low yields both in absolute terms and as measured by spreads over investment-grade credits. I worry about this as a risk that has been propagated by QE3, though I do not believe it is the Fed’s job to rescue reckless investors from the errors of their ways.\n\nThe stock market bottomed in March 2009 and had already more than doubled by the time we initiated QE3. It has since risen by another 40 percent; equities have, all-in, tripled in price since the lows of 2009. Only time will tell if stocks have risen to unsustainable heights and, if so, how deep a correction might be needed to bring them back to sustainable valuations.\n\nThe Last FOMC\n\nI believe that the Fed should, in most circumstances, not directly concern itself with fluctuations in financial-asset prices. If the economy is strong, the securities markets will be propelled by that strength. If the real economy is hearty, it can withstand reversions to the mean of junk bond or any other trading market and stock market corrections: It did so during the prolonged correction of 1962 and again in 1987. For this reason, as we approached our deliberations at last week’s FOMC, I saw no reason for the Fed to react to the heightened volatility that occurred in mid-October and strongly advised my colleagues that we should be wary of any action we might take at the FOMC that would lead investors to assume there is a “Yellen Put” hidden in our pocket. For this would only encourage continued indiscriminate investing.\n\nI view the economy as becoming stronger. My colleagues and I at the Dallas Fed realize that the current unemployment rate, at 5.9 percent as of September, is still somewhat above most estimates of the “natural,” or minimum-sustainable, rate of unemployment. But the gap between actual and “natural” unemployment has been rapidly shrinking and is now less than 1 percentage point.\n\nSome commentators argue that the unemployment rate hasn’t been a reliable indicator of labor-market slack during the last five years. As evidence, these commentators point to subdued wage growth. We at the Dallas Fed have investigated the links between wage inflation and the unemployment rate using the aggregate data that are available for the U.S., and also using state-level data. These investigations have led us to three main conclusions. First, wage growth responds to the unemployment rate with a lag. That’s no mystery: Many employers adjust wage and salaries just once each year. Second, wage growth becomes increasingly sensitive to the unemployment rate as the unemployment rate reaches lower and lower levels. A drop in the unemployment rate from 9 percent to 8 percent may not do much for the negotiating leverage of the typical worker. But the story is different when the unemployment rate drops from 6 percent to 5 percent or below, for example.\n\nFinally, taking these two factors into account, there’s been nothing at all unusual about the behavior of wage growth over the period since the national unemployment rate peaked nearly five years ago. We went through a deep recession. Coming out of a deep recession, it takes time for the unemployment rate to reach levels where wage growth picks up noticeably. Wage growth was about 1½ percent in both 2010 and 2011—not too surprising, given that the unemployment rate was 9.9 percent in the final quarter of 2009 and, at 9.6 percent, nearly as high in the final quarter of 2010. Since then, the unemployment rate has fallen by a little less than 1 percentage point each year, and wage growth has picked up by 0.2 percentage points each year. Three quarters into 2014, wage growth is already up another two-tenths, to 2.1 percent at an annual rate.\n\nThis pattern of rising wage growth is roughly what one would have expected judging by prerecession data.[3] If anything, wage growth has been running a bit above what we should have expected. This contradicts the view that the unemployment rate has understated labor-market slack.\n\nOf course, the Federal Reserve has a target for price inflation, not wage inflation. The rate of wage inflation consistent with our 2 percent price-inflation target depends on secular trends in labor productivity growth and in labor’s bargaining power—trends over which the Federal Reserve has no control and about which it can only make informed guesses. Nevertheless, the Dallas Fed’s study of the Phillips curve has an important lesson for Fed policymakers: If we keep pushing on the accelerator pedal until wage growth matches the rate that we believe to be sustainable, we will likely have pushed too far and missed our exit. Because wage growth reacts to slack with a lag, it will continue to increase even after policy stimulus is removed. Because wage growth rises at an increasing rate the farther the unemployment rate declines, the overshoot is likely to be large.\n\nI liken monetary policy to duck hunting. If you want to bag a mallard, you don’t aim where the bird is at present, you aim ahead of its flight pattern. To me, the flight pattern of the economy is clearly toward increasing employment and inflation that is approaching our 2-percent target.\n\nThus, I was encouraged by the wording we negotiated at the last FOMC meeting. I was pleased that we dropped the reference to “significant” in describing the remaining labor-market slack and that wording was included indicating we might well move to raise rates sooner than thus far assumed, should the economy proceed along the trajectory I think we are on. To me, this neutered the adjective “considerable” in stating the time frame under which we might act. This is why this particular hawk voted “yes” in support of the statement we released on Wednesday.\n\nNow to the Exit...\n\nOf course, I am concerned with what will happen to all the liquidity that remains in the system in the aftermath of our QE programs. The depository institutions we transact with have put back to the 12 Federal Reserve Banks some $2.7 trillion in excess reserves. “Excess” means they cannot find better uses for that money than earning the 25 basis points (25/100ths of one percent per annum) we pay them until they can find creditworthy borrowers to lend to at significant multiples of that amount. And considering that this $2.7 trillion represents perhaps as little as one-fifth of the amount of ready liquidity in the U.S. financial system—that being held not just on deposit at the Fed Banks but also by nonfinancial corporations, private equity funds, other investors and households—there is a lot of inflationary tinder available should the Fed mismanage its exit from the hyper-accommodative policy we have pursued and augmented with QE3.\n\nThus, only time will reveal the efficacy of the policy we have pursued and whether the risks that I and other observers (among them my mentor, Paul Volcker) fret over are as substantial, or whether we have made much ado about nothing.\n\nMy former colleague, the wonderful ex-banker and much-admired Fed Governor Betsy Duke, was quoted on Oct. 28 in The Washington Post as saying this about QE3: “It’s still important to see what the ultimate costs are going to be. You can’t really judge those until it’s completely unwound.”[4] Betsy is spot on.\n\nChanneling Shakespeare\n\nIn June of last year, I gave a speech in Toronto in which I likened the post-zero-bound monetary policy to a Shakespearean drama with five acts, suggesting we were then in the last scene of the third act of a play titled “The Grand Experiment in Modern Monetarism.”[5] I posited we will not know until the final act whether the play will end felicitously or otherwise.\n\nI thought I would update that analogy here today. Here is the CliffsNotes summary: The play opened with the great financial tempest of 2008–09, during which it appeared the ship of the mighty American economy would founder. A humble, once unassuming but suddenly daring captain named Ben Bernanke took firm control of the nation’s monetary helm in Act II, working with his officers—the FOMC—to contrive innovative ways to keep the economy afloat by jury-rigging monetary policy and adopting radical tactical maneuvers. These efforts succeeded in steering the ship of the economy away from the shoals of depression and deflation and into more tranquil waters.\n\nAct III began with a recovering economy heading on a more promising course. But the headway being made was substandard, hindered by the flotsam and jetsam of fiscal incompetence and rising fears of a new storm brewing in Europe. In an effort to propel the economy forward at a better clip, the FOMC commanded that unprecedented amounts of monetary fuel be provisioned for the financial system through large-scale asset purchases, the proceeds of which were pumped into the stores of banks.\n\nBut as Act IV began, the banks lingered in the wings rather than taking center stage. Rather than shovel their abundant means into their loan boilers, they were parsimonious and hoarded their fuel. Other members of the financial fleet, however, were heartened by the turn of events, especially those who finance themselves through the issuance of stocks and bonds rather than through bank loans. They danced a happy jig while they decorated their balance sheets with cheaper debt and improved their margins and earnings per share through share buybacks. Slowly they began to hire new workers, and the ship of the economy started gathering momentum to steam along at an improved clip.\n\nAs Act IV came to an end, the FOMC evaluated the utility of its navigational tactics, and having tentatively decided that it was on course to its desired destination, began cutting back on the amount of fuel it was pumping into the financial system. Initially, it fumbled the dialogue, but eventually the articulation of its intention was accepted, if not applauded, by its audience.\n\nNow we have entered Act V. Not until the final scene will we know whether we have achieved the auspicious outcome of arriving at the desired port of an economy that grows sufficiently to bring about full employment without giving rise to inflation. With Shakespeare, the most pleasant plays typically end in marriage. The happy outcome to our economic predicament would entail the marriage of sensible fiscal policy with prudent monetary policy, carrying the American economy to new horizons, allowing the Fed to emerge a hero.\n\nOne can envision less-pleasant outcomes, however, some of them tragic. If, even after the mid-term elections tomorrow, the fiscal authorities—Congress and the president—are unable to provide tax, spending and regulatory incentives for job creators to use the cheap and abundant capital the FOMC and other creditors have made available, the economy might once again find itself becalmed. In the speech I gave nearly four years ago to your sponsor, the Manhattan Institute, I specifically said of the then new Congress: “For all the hoopla (surrounding it), it will prove to be nothing more than a case of putting old, rancid wine in new bottles.”[6] Pray this does not happen again. Should the FOMC then try to compensate for fiscal authorities’ inability to act by provisioning still more monetary fuel, it may risk an explosion of speculative excess, or worse: an eventual inflationary conflagration, the debasement of money and the ruination of our economy and lifestyle. Should this prove the outcome, the Fed will be transmogrified from hero to villain.\n\nTo thicken the plot, as Act V began, Captain Bernanke exited stage right and a new skipper entered stage left. I should say here that I advocated for this particular skipper. Janet Yellen, when she was just another member of the crew as a Fed governor, was pigeonholed as a “dove” (forgive the double-entendre; doves are, ornithologically speaking, part of the pigeon family) but has proven herself in her role at the helm of the FOMC to be neither dove nor hawk. Rather, she is impressively balanced and fully aware, at least in my opinion, that her legacy will be whether she can successfully complete Act V by realizing the Fed’s mandate to maintain price stability while providing the monetary means to achieve full employment.\n\nAll of which means that despite the mighty efforts of Captains Bernanke and Yellen and their officers and crew, present company included, we do not know how “The Grand Experiment” drama will end. We certainly all hope it proves an inspiring history, not a tragedy. But, we will not know for some time. We will not know until the curtain drops on Act V.\n\nR.I.P?\n\nBetsy Duke had it right: Only when we have normalized monetary policy—only when the play is done—will we know if QE3 rests in peace or comes back to haunt us. Only when it is done will we know if “The Grand Experiment in Modern Monetarism” is a smash hit or a bomb or something in between.\n\nAs Yogi Berra said and Lenny Kravitz sang: “It ain’t over till it’s over.” But one thing I know for sure: This speech is over. Thank you for listening.\n\nAnd now, Mickey, time and patience permitting, I would be happy to avoid answering any questions you and your colleagues might have.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "September 19, 2014 Dallas\n\nThat wonderful, hyperbolic video makes reference to my father, Les Fisher. His story helps put this occasion in proper perspective.\n\nLast November, I was in Queensland, Australia, and stood in the very court where, 104 years ago, just two months past his 5th birthday, he was sentenced to seven years in Westbrook Reformatory for begging for food.\n\nHere is what the court minutes say:\n\n“Lengthy evidence was taken from which it appears that the child’s mother had deserted [him] … The [child] has been in the care of the father for several weeks; and at 4 a.m. on the 18th, the father and child were found sleeping together under a sort of grated bridge or platform.” The arresting officer testified, “I have never known [the father] to do any work. … I could see he was begging. … For the past two months he has almost constantly had the little boy with him day and night. I have heard complaints about the way the boy was treated. … The child was hungry.”\n\nWestbrook Reformatory was considered the most sadistic reformatory in Australia; many of the boys sentenced to Westbrook were either beaten to death or committed suicide or, if they survived, became hardened criminals. But my dad was spared. Two weeks after he arrived, the warden received a letter from the Home Secretary’s Office remitting the unexpired portion of the sentence of a seven-year detention.\n\nHe was released to an orphanage, then doled out to a series of foster homes, one so cruel as to tie him by his ankle at night to an outdoor post, waking him in the predawn hours to deliver milk by horse-drawn carriage. He became an “apprentice”—a euphemism for something akin to indenture—in a tool shop, working lathes during the day and sleeping on the shop floor at night.\n\nAt the age of 14, his teeth are so rotten they are replaced by false ones. Eventually, at the age of 17, he is released to the care of a family who takes him by ship to South Africa, where he becomes a bus driver, sells Hupmobile cars and, for the first time, makes money. He falls in love with the daughter of a widowed Norwegian woman who cooks for a boarding house. They set sail for the Promised Land, America, only to discover that his record and lack of documentation make him inadmissible as a permanent resident. He retreats to Tijuana, Mexico, where he outsmarts the bookies at the horse track and crisscrosses the border to sell cars for eight years before he is admitted for U.S. citizenship in 1947.\n\nHe then hires out to collect a payment in Shanghai for a chemical company. In Shanghai, his wife becomes pregnant with their third child; they leave Shanghai on the second-to-last ship to sail from China before Mao’s forces close the port. They dock in Los Angeles and he sets about working countless jobs in countless places: He sells tools and silver in Mexico, airplanes in Indonesia, used cars in Florida, men’s suits in New York and women’s undergarments in the Caribbean. He smokes 72 cigarettes a day until his mid-50s and enjoys liberal portions of Scotch whiskey, but he lives to the ripe old age of 90 years before dying in Austin, Texas.\n\nBy now, everyone knows that the son who was “manufactured in China” is me, your honoree. In one generation, a great shift occurred: from homeless to Harvard; from a brutal reformatory in Queensland to the great banking house of Brown Brothers Harriman in New York; from being tied by the ankle at night in the yard behind a foster home to living in the tony neighborhood of Highland Park, Texas; from working lathes during the day and sleeping on the shop floor at night to becoming president and CEO of a $180 billion Federal Reserve Bank and a member of the Federal Open Market Committee—a group of 19 that decides monetary policy for the world’s most powerful economy. From abuse and derision and scorn to being praised in that beautiful video by Henry Kissinger, Janet Yellen, Admiral (Bobby R.) Inman, Ray Hunt, Herb Kelleher and Randall Stephenson and my fellow honoree and the chairman of the Dallas Fed Board, Mike Ullman, one of the nicest men God ever put on this good earth.\n\nFrom sleeping under a bridge and begging for food to being here tonight at this sumptuous dinner to receive the Woodrow Wilson Award for Public Service.\n\nWhat an honor! For me. For my father (and my mother). For my family.\n\nOnly in America could this be possible!\n\nI am deeply grateful. But I did not get here alone.\n\nTwo of the people who led me to tonight are in the audience. I want to ask them to stand up. The first is my eldest brother, Mike Fisher. Mike has had a distinguished career in institutional investing and just stepped down as chairman of the board of trustees of Bryant University. When times were tough for our family—and at times they were, especially when we moved back to the United States from Mexico and were flat broke—he was the one who paid the rent and put food on our table. He is a hero. And so is the other man I want to ask to stand, my mentor: Paul Volcker. Paul is an example of principle, of putting the needs of the nation above political expediency: He saved our country from economic destruction and has been an example to me since I first met him back when I worked at Brown Brothers in the 1970s. Thank you, Mike and Paul, for showing me the way. (By the way, if you add together their height, you have a full 13 feet 2 inches of exemplary leadership: They are Big Men in more than a leadership sense.)\n\nOne last comment: I am proud of this honor, this recognition of “accomplishment.” But let me brag on my greatest accomplishment: my children. I’d like to ask my son Anders to stand up. Anders, his sister Alison and brother James, who could not be here tonight, and their late sister Texana are the greatest accomplishments of my life. They clearly got their clever brains and good looks and many talents from their mother. But tonight, I am going to take a wee bit of credit for the remarkable people they have become and want them to know that as proud as I am to receive this award, I am proudest of all for just being their dad.\n\nThank you.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "September 4, 2014 Dallas\n\nThank you, Ashok (Mago). I am so honored to have been invited to join Ambassador (S.) Jaishankar this evening to celebrate the U.S.–India Chamber of Commerce and its many distinguished awardees.\n\nMr. Ambassador, I am delighted you are here in Texas tonight. I am going to give you a few statistics in a moment that I think will make readily apparent the reason for this large audience and why so many Indian entrepreneurs and professionals come to Texas. Then I am going to give you a snapshot of where the U.S. economy is at present and what we are grappling with at the Fed. But first, with your indulgence, I want to briefly speak of the relationship between our two great countries, India and the United States.\n\nTime to Enhance the U.S.–India Working Relationship\n\nThe logic of an enhanced strategic relationship between my country and yours is crystal clear, beginning with a harsh geopolitical reality: You live in a tough neighborhood and need us; we, in turn, need all the friends we can muster in your geographic sphere. It seems very timely that we overcome the history that has separated us and begin working more closely together.\n\nDuring the Cold War, it was the view of many in the United States that India was too closely allied with the Soviet Union. American businesses that looked at India found it afflicted with the legacy of the worst of British bureaucratic administration. (The old joke was that you could never get morning tee times at any Indian golf course because the bureaucrats had locked them up at least until noon).\n\nFrom an Indian perspective, America seemed too hegemonic. Attempts by U.S. companies to invest and do business in your homeland revived memories of the East India Company.\n\nWe viewed each other through the lens of the time and against a background of our own histories, with suspicion.\n\nBut the (Berlin) Wall came down, the economy has been globalized and cyberized, and new threats to security have arisen, many of them from nonstate actors or forces who operate from within failed states to inflict damage elsewhere. This is a time for like-minded people to unite and work together.\n\nWe are like-minded in that we are democracies. But tonight we celebrate something even more fundamental. My reading of India is that, like in the U.S., your country men and women are more pragmatic and business-oriented than they are ideological or inherently bureaucratic.\n\nThe recent election of Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi offers the promise of making this abundantly clear. He was, after all, the chief minister for over a decade of the Gujarat, the most probusiness state in India. And almost every U.S. business leader I know has heard of Ratan Tata’s experience when he looked to Gujarat for an alternative to the frustration of his attempt to build a new car factory in West Bengal. As I understand it, Mr. Tata went to see Minister Modi, had a handshake deal in 30 minutes, and in 14 months the new factory was up and running. That almost makes Texas look like California by comparison!\n\nSo Mr. Ambassador, we are all watching for this first prime minister born since Independence to work his probusiness, nonbureaucratic, can-do spirit upon the whole of India. It is in America’s interest for India to thrive. We wish Prime Minister Modi, the government you represent with such distinction, and the Indian nation the very best of luck.\n\nThe Texas Jagannatha\n\nTonight, you and I are surrounded by the smart, probusiness people of Indian heritage who have chosen to invest and operate within the most probusiness state in the United States.\n\nI am going to throw up a few slides to quickly summarize the environment in which they operate.\n\nTexas is a job-creating juggernaut. I pick that word deliberately, knowing it derives from the Hindi Jagannatha and is, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, a title of Krishna. Specifically, it is: “the uncouth idol of this deity at Puri in Orissa, annually dragged in procession on an enormous car,” crushing everything in its path. But Hindu or Muslim or whatever your faith, while one might consider Texans to on occasion be uncouth, there is no denying that our economy is an enormous job-creating car that enables and advances its devotees rather than crushing them. A job is the road to dignity and to the prosperity of any people, and Texas has become the most prosperous of states.\n\nHere is a graph depicting job growth in Texas versus the other large states that typically have drawn Indian and other investment and immigration:\n\n\n\nFor over two decades, we have outperformed the rest of the United States in job creation by a factor of more than 2 to 1. Over 23 years, only nine net new jobs have been created for every 100 that existed in New York in 1990, whereas in Texas, 66 jobs have been created.\n\nWe have been especially prolific in creating jobs since the Great Recession waylaid the world at the end of 2007. Today, employment in Texas is 8.6 percent above its prerecession peak. The nation as a whole is 0.5 percent—zero point five percent—above its previous peak. However, if you take Texas out of the U.S. economy, statistically speaking, you see that the U.S. ex-Texas still has not caught up to its prerecession employment levels. Here is a graph that shows the margin of difference in employment performance:\n\n\n\nAccording to Bureau of Labor Statistics’ payroll employment data, Texas has created 1,100,600 jobs since November 2007; the rest of America is still 349,600 jobs shy of the prior employment peak.\n\nTexas has been the crucible of job creation in America.\n\nMore than Oil and Gas; Jobs Well-Distributed\n\nIt is a common perception that the jobs that have been created here are primarily in the burgeoning energy sector. It is true that Texas is an energy powerhouse: We produce more than 3 million barrels of oil and 21 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day. To put this in perspective, Texas produces more oil than Kuwait or Venezuela or, if you’d like, more oil than the amount the U.S. imports from the Middle East. With regard to natural gas, Texas produces more than all 28 countries of the European Union combined.\n\nOf course, the energy sector is a significant driver for the Texas economy. Last year, the state saw an increase of 16,100 jobs related to oil and gas extraction and associated support services. We are grateful for every one of them. Yet there are seven other sectors of the Texas economy that produced more jobs than the energy sector last year. Here is a graphic summary of where jobs were created in the Lone Star State in 2013:\n\n\n\nIn terms of number of jobs created, the leading sectors in Texas last year were trade, transportation and utilities (accounting for 73,700), professional and business services (44,600), leisure and hospitality (42,300), educational and health services (33,500), construction (26,800), government (19,700) and financial activities (18,100).\n\nThis year through July, Texas employment has already increased by 238,200 jobs, a 3.6 percent annualized growth pace. Over the 12 months ending this July, Texas added just shy of 400,000 jobs—more jobs than any other state. Clearly, Texas employment is growing at an impressive clip.\n\nAnother misperception is that all of these jobs created in Texas are low-paying jobs. Wrong. We have been creating jobs in every income quartile, unlike the rest of the country. This graph, recently updated, covers the 13-year period from 2000 to 2013. It charts job creation by wage quartile in Texas and in the nation ex-Texas.\n\n\n\nAs you can see, Texas has had healthy growth in every income quartile, while, without Texas, the United States has actually seen job destruction, on net, in the two middle-income quartiles. (This fact deeply concerns me because middle-income groups are the backbone of America.)\n\nU.S. Economy Is on the Mend\n\nThe reality, Mr. Ambassador, is that Texas is part of the United States and, all told, our economy is on the mend from the frightful shock of the financial and economic implosion of 2007–09.\n\nThis is the dashboard that we at the Dallas Fed use to track our national economy:\n\n\n\nThe Federal Reserve is mandated by the laws of the United States to manage monetary policy to achieve full employment while maintaining price stability and “moderate interest rates” over time.[1]\n\nA ‘Hindu Goddess’\n\nAs you can see from this graphic, unemployment has declined to 6.2 percent, and the dynamics of the labor market are improving. At the Federal Open Market Committee, where we set monetary policy for the nation, we have been working to better understand these employment dynamics. This is no easy task. Bill Gross, one of our country’s preeminent bond managers, made a rather pungent comment about our efforts. He noted that President Harry Truman “wanted a one-armed economist, not the usual sort that analyzes every problem with ‘on the one hand, this, and on the other, that.’” Gross claimed that Fed Chair (Janet) Yellen, in her speech given recently at the Fed’s Jackson Hole, Wyo., conference, introduced so many qualifications about the status of the labor market that “instead of the proverbial two-handed economist, she more resembled a Hindu goddess with a half-dozen or more appendages.”[2]\n\nWhether you analyze the labor markets with one arm or two, or six or 19, the issue is how quickly we are approaching capacity utilization, so as to gauge price pressures. After all, a central bank is first and foremost charged with maintaining the purchasing power of its country’s currency. Like most central banks around the world, we view a 2 percent inflation rate as a decent intermediate-term target. Of late, the various inflation indexes have been beating around this mark. Just this last Friday, the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index for July was released, and it clocked in at a 1 percent annualized rate, a pace less than the run rate of April through June.\n\nDoes this mean we are experiencing an inflation rate that is less than acceptable? I wonder. At the Dallas Fed, we calculate a trimmed mean inflation rate for personal consumption expenditures to get what we think is the best sense of the underlying inflation rate for the normal consumer. This means we trim out the most volatile price movements in the consumer basket to achieve the best sense we can of underlying price stability. In the July statistics, we saw some of the fastest rates of increases in a while for the largest, least-volatile components of core services, such as rent and purchased meals.[3] So the jury is out as to whether we have seen a reversal in the recent upward ascent of prices toward our 2 percent target.\n\nAs to achieving “moderate interest rates,” the dashboard shows that we have overshot the mark. Interest rates on the lowest-quality credits—on “junk”—are historically low, as are the spreads they are priced at above the current historically low nominal rates for investment-grade credits. I have been involved with the credit markets since 1975. I have never seen such ebullient credit markets. The 30-year Treasury yield is trading at a hair over 3 percent. If Ambassador Jaishankar and I were to abandon our service to our respective nations and form a company, we would use our good names to borrow as much money as we could at current rates.\n\nAnd this, indeed, is happening. U.S. companies have used this bond market and borrowing rate hiatus from normalcy to pile up cheap, nearly cost-free balances. This cheap and abundant monetary fuel, with the proper incentives from the fiscal and regulatory authorities, can be deployed to the benefit of company stakeholders (shareholders and employees) to enrich and grow the economy. In this sense, we are unique in the world.\n\nMr. Ambassador, American businesses are rich and muscular. And those muscles are being flexed. For example, just two days ago, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) released its Purchasing Managers Index. The data surprised most all forecasters to the upside. Activity was broad based: 17 of 18 industries surveyed reported growth in August, and new orders reached a 10-year high. Today, the ISM released its nonmanufacturing index, which registered the highest level in nine years. These reports echo a string of others—including the Beige Book survey of regional economic conditions released yesterday by the Federal Reserve—that underscore the healing that is taking place in the U.S. economy despite our having what is, in truth, a dysfunctional and counterproductive fiscal and regulatory environment. All we need now is for the fiscal and regulatory authorities—Congress and the executive branch—to unleash the animal spirit of business that is well nourished with the feed of cash and ready to roll.\n\nWodehouse’s Perspective\n\nI happen to share a common bond with Indians: I have long been a reader of P.G. Wodehouse.[4] In his book, Big Money, published in 1931, he has a wonderful passage in which a young lad nicknamed Biscuit describes the woman he has fallen in love with: “… when I think that a girl can be such a ripper and at the same time so dashed rich, it restores my faith in the Providence which looks after good men.” Be it Providence or the Fed, the American business community is at present a “ripper”—it looks darned good—and is “dashed rich.” We are poised for a healthy, sustainable expansion. The men and women in this room see it in Texas. I trust they will see it in the whole of the United States. And I trust they and others like them will use it to lead the world, including India, to expanded economic prosperity.\n\nThank you for having me here this evening.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "July 16, 2014 Los Angeles\n\nThank you Willow [Bay]. Willow is more than an accomplished journalist. She is a hallowed figure in our family for having introduced my son Miles to his wife, Lucy. So, above and beyond Willow’s remarkable formal credentials, I am beholden to her. Her kind invitation to return to LA and the University of Southern California today was a command, and I snapped to it!\n\nLet me cut to the chase: I am increasingly concerned about the risks of our current monetary policy. In a nutshell, my concerns are as follows:\n\nFirst, I believe we are experiencing financial excess that is of our own making. When money is dirt cheap and ubiquitous, it is in the nature of financial operators to reach for yield. There is a lot of talk about “macroprudential supervision” as a way to prevent financial excess from creating financial instability. My view is that it has significant utility but is not a sufficient preventative. Macroprudential supervision is something of a Maginot Line: It can be circumvented. Relying upon it to prevent financial instability provides an artificial sense of confidence.\n\nSecond, I believe we are at risk of doing what the Fed has too often done: overstaying our welcome by staying too loose too long. We did a good job in staving off the deflationary and depression risks that were present in the aftermath of the 2007–09 financial crisis. We now risk falling into the trap of fighting the last war rather than the present challenge. The economy is reaching our desired destination faster than we imagined.\n\nThird, should we overstay our welcome, we risk not only doing damage to the economy but also being viewed as politically pliant.\n\nThe Rub\n\nWillow, to put all this in context, I was uncomfortable with QE3, the program whereby we committed to a sustained purchase of $85 billion per month of longer-term U.S. Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities (MBS). I considered QE3 to be overkill at the time, as our balance sheet had already expanded from $900 billion to $2 trillion by the time we launched it, and financial markets had begun to lift off their bottom. I said so publicly and I argued accordingly in the inner temple of the Fed, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), where we determine monetary policy for the nation. I lost that argument. My learned colleagues felt the need to buy protection from what they feared was a risk of deflation and a further downturn in the economy. I accepted as a consolation prize the agreement, finally reached last December, to taper in graduated steps our large-scale asset purchases of Treasuries and MBS from $85 billion a month to zero this coming October. I said so publicly at the very beginning of this year in my capacity as a voting member of the FOMC. As we have been proceeding along these lines, I have not felt the compulsion to say much, or cast a dissenting vote.\n\nHowever, given the rapidly improving employment picture, developments on the inflationary front, and my own background as a banker and investment and hedge fund manager, I am finding myself increasingly at odds with some of my respected colleagues at the policy table of the Federal Reserve as well as with the thinking of many notable economists.\n\nHere is the rub as I see it: The Fed as the nation’s monetary authority has been running a hyper-accommodative monetary policy in order to lift the economy out of the doldrums and counteract a possible deflationary spiral. Starting six years ago, we embarked on a path to make money costless and abundantly available. We did so in several stages that are by now well known, culminating by shifting into high gear with the aforementioned QE3 program whereby we have since more than doubled the Fed’s balance sheet to $4.5 trillion.\n\nPreviously, we influenced financial markets and the economy by managing the federal funds rate, the overnight rate that anchors the yield curve. Presently, 75 percent of Federal Reserve-held loans and securities have remaining maturities in excess of five years, and we own roughly 40 percent of the stock of U.S. Treasury bonds and a similar proportion of MBS. This is an unprecedented profile for the portfolio of the keeper of the watch for the global financial system.\n\nWhen we buy a Treasury note or bond or an MBS, we pay for it with reserves we create. This injects liquidity into the economy. This liquidity can be used by financial intermediaries to lend to businesses to invest in job-creating capital expansion or by investors to finance the repairing of balance sheets at cheaper cost or on better terms, or for myriad other uses, including feeding speculative flows into financial markets.\n\nMuch of what we have paid out to purchase Treasuries and MBS has been put back to the Fed in the form of excess reserves deposited at the Federal Reserve Banks, such as the Dallas Fed. As of July 9, $2.517 trillion of excess reserves were parked on the 12 Fed Banks’ balance sheets, while depository institutions wait to find eager and worthy borrowers to lend to.\n\nBut with low interest rates and abundant availability of credit in the nondepository market, the bond markets and other trading markets have spawned an abundance of speculative activity. There is no greater gift to a financial market operator—or anyone, for that matter—than free and abundant money. It reduces the cost of taking risk. But it also burns a hole in the proverbial pocket. It enhances the appeal of things that might not otherwise look so comely. I have likened the effect to that of strapping on what students here at USC and campuses elsewhere call “beer goggles.” This phenomenon occurs when alcohol renders alluring what might otherwise appear less clever or attractive. And this is, indeed, what has happened to stocks and bonds and other financial investments as a result of the free-flowing liquidity we at the Fed have poured down the throat of the economy.\n\nLessons from Swift and Irwin\n\nAt the Fed, as with any great university like USC, there is a culture of citing serious academic studies to document one’s thesis (especially if you are the lead or coauthor of the study!). You needn’t be an academic economist, however, to understand the danger of too much money. A student of literature can cite Jonathan Swift and his “Poems,” written in 1735:\n\nMoney, the life-blood of the nation,\nCorrupts and stagnates in the veins,\nUnless a proper circulation\nIts motion and its heat maintains.\n\nAs evidenced by the buildup in excess bank reserves, the money we have printed has not been as properly circulated as we had hoped. Too much of it has gone toward corrupting or, more appropriately stated, corrosive speculation.\n\nTo get a sense of some of the effects of excess liquidity, you need look no further than Neil Irwin’s front-page, above-the-fold article in the July 8 issue of the New York Times, titled “From Stocks to Farmland, All’s Booming, or Bubbling.” “Welcome to … the Everything Bubble,” it reads. “Around the world, nearly every asset class is expensive by historical standards. Stocks and bonds; emerging markets and advanced economies; urban office towers and Iowa farmland; you name it, and it is trading at prices that are high by historical standards relative to fundamentals.” Irwin’s comments bear heeding, although it may be difficult to disentangle how much these lofty valuations are distorted by the historically low “risk-free” interest rate that underpins all financial asset valuations that we at the Fed have engineered.\n\nI spoke of this early in January, referencing various indicia of the effects on financial markets of “the intoxicating brew we (at the Fed) have been pouring.” In another speech, in March, I said that “market distortions and acting on bad incentives are becoming more pervasive” and noted that “we must monitor these indicators very carefully so as to ensure that the ghost of ‘irrational exuberance’ does not haunt us again.” Then again in April, in a speech in Hong Kong, I listed the following as possible signs of exuberance getting wilder still:\n\nI concluded then that “the former funds manager in me sees these as yellow lights. The central banker in me is reminded of the mandate to safeguard financial stability.”[1]\n\nSince then, the valuation of a broad swath of financial assets has become even richer, or perhaps more accurately stated, more careless. It is worrisome, for example, that covenant-lite lending has continued its meteoric revival and has even surpassed its 2007 highs.\n\nMacroprudential Supervision: A Maginot Line?\n\nThere are some who believe that “macroprudential supervision” will safeguard us from financial instability. I am more skeptical. Such supervision entails the vigilant monitoring of capital and liquidity ratios, tighter restrictions on bank practices and subjecting banks to stress tests. Although these macroprudential disciplines are important steps in reducing systemic risk, I also think it is important to remember that this is not your grandparents’ financial system. The Federal Reserve and the banking supervisory authorities used to oversee the majority of the credit system by regulating depository institutions; now, depository institutions account for no more than 20 percent of the credit markets. So, yes, we have appropriately tightened the screws on the depository institutions. But there is a legitimate question as to whether these safeguards represent no more than a financial Maginot Line, providing us with an artificial sense of confidence.\n\nIf you look up “Maginot Line” in Wikipedia—the source of most of the world’s conventional wisdom—it notes that “… experts extolled the Maginot line as a work of genius.” It did prevent Germany from leading a direct attack on France during World War II. But it was ultimately ineffective as the Germans outflanked it through neighboring Belgium. “Genius” proved insufficient to thwart a determined force. Thus, the term “Maginot Line” is commonly used to connote a strategy that clever people hoped would prove effective, but instead fails to do the job.\n\nWith this in mind, and given that our direct supervisory authority covers roughly only a fifth of the credit system, the Dodd–Frank legislation called for the creation of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). This committee composed of members from the Fed and other regulatory authorities is tasked with identifying and monitoring risks posed by so-called systemically important financial institutions. These financial institutions—banks and nonbanks alike—are better known as “SIFIs,” an acronym that appropriately sounds like something you might get from wanton behavior. Just last week, Fed Vice Chair Stan Fischer spoke of the need to fortify the FSOC process. I agree with him that this is a sensible thing to do.\n\nAnd yet one has to consider the root cause of the “Everything Boom.” I believe the root cause is the hyper-accommodative monetary policy of the Federal Reserve and other central banks. This was recently written about and documented at length in the annual report of the Bank for International Settlements, a report I highly recommend to you.[2] The Fed and other central banks have been the catalysts for a search for yield. Markets discount risk liberally if they are under the spell of a presumed central bank “put” that will diminish the risk of loss. They will continually seek a financial Belgium or some other venue to bypass the protective wall that macro-financial supervision and oversight bodies such as the FSOC are believed to represent, however fortified.\n\nAn Adjustment to the Stance of Monetary Policy\n\nI am not alone in worrying about this. In her recent lecture at the International Monetary Fund, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said, “I am also mindful of the potential for low interest rates to heighten the incentives of financial market participants to reach for yield and take on risk, and of the limits of macroprudential measures to address these and other financial stability concerns,” adding that “[a]ccordingly, there may be times when an adjustment in monetary policy may be appropriate to ameliorate emerging risks to financial stability.”\n\nHere is the message: At some point you cross the line from reviving markets to becoming the bellows fanning the flames of the “Booming and Bubbling” that Neil Irwin writes about. I believe we have crossed that line. I believe we need an adjustment to the stance of monetary policy.\n\nOur duty as the nation’s central bank is not to engineer a “put” to the markets. Our duty is mandated by Congress and the amendments it made under the Federal Reserve Act in 1977. Specifically, the amended act states: “The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the FOMC shall maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy’s long run potential to increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates.”\n\nTake It from Shakespeare’s Portia\n\nIn my opinion, we have certainly taken liberty with the definition of “moderate interest rates.” The Oxford English Dictionary defines “moderate” as “avoiding extremes.” And, aptly, it cites among the first uses of the adjective “moderate” Portia’s monologue in Shakespeare’s Merchant of Venice: “O love be moderate, allay thy ecstasy. In measure rain thy joy. Scant this excess. I feel too much thy blessing. Make it less. For fear I surfeit.”[3]\n\n“Joy,” “ecstasy,” “excess,” “surfeit,” “too much”: These words are certainly descriptive of the current status of the credit, equity and other trading markets that have felt the blessing of near-zero cost of funds and the abundant rain of money made possible by the Fed and other central banks that have followed in our footsteps.\n\nSome are willing to tolerate the consequences of the blessings that the Fed poured upon the financial markets because, in their view, we have yet to close in on the other parts of our mandate, to wit: “promot[ing] effectively the goals of maximum employment and stable prices.” So where do we stand on those two fronts? Answer: closer than many think.\n\nI will be arguing at the upcoming FOMC meetings that while it is difficult to define “maximum employment,” labor-market conditions are improving smartly, quicker than the principals of the FOMC expected. The commonly cited household survey unemployment rate has arrived at 6.1 percent a full six months ahead of the schedule predicted only four weeks ago by the central tendency of the forecasts of FOMC participants. The most recent data indicate that nonfarm employment surprised to the upside, increasing by 288,000 in June, and prior months’ increases were revised upward. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ so-called JOLTS (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey) data indicate that job openings are trending sharply higher, while “quits” as a percentage of total separations continue to trend upward—a sign that workers are confident of finding new and better opportunities if they leave their current positions.\n\nAnd there are areas where jobs are going unfilled. If you had opened the July 8 edition of the Wall Street Journal to page A2, you would have seen an eye-catching headline: “Help Wanted: In Truck Cabs.” This article noted that not only are we presently short 30,000 long-distance truck drivers who earn an average annual pay of $49,540, but also that “[b]usinesses with openings across the pay and education spectrum are struggling to hire house cleaners, registered nurses, engineers, software developers and other workers.”\n\nBoth statistically and anecdotally, we are now getting a consistent message from a variety of sources that the labor market, broadly considered—and not just in booming regional economies like Texas’—is tightening. The employment gap is closing faster than most forecasters foresaw.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that wages are beginning to lift. For example, median usual weekly earnings collected as part of the Current Population Survey are now growing at a rate of 3 percent, roughly their precrisis average. The latest survey of the National Federation of Independent Business, released last week, shows the net percentage of small firms planning to raise wages is up sharply over the past year. In short, the key variable of the price of labor, which the FOMC feared was stagnant, appears to have taken on life and is beginning to turn upward. It is not doing so dramatically. But the relationship between the unemployment rate and wage growth is nonlinear, so that as the unemployment rate falls, the incremental impact on wage growth accelerates. And wage growth is an important driver of inflation.\n\nThe FOMC has a medium-term inflation target of 2 percent as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index. It is noteworthy that the 12-month consumer price index (CPI), the Cleveland Fed’s median CPI, and the so-called sticky CPI calculated by the Atlanta Fed have all crossed 2 percent, and the Dallas Fed’s Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate has headline inflation averaging 1.7 percent on a 12-month basis, up from 1.3 percent only a few months ago.[4] PCE inflation is clearly rising toward our 2 percent goal more quickly than the FOMC imagined.\n\nI want to be clear on this: I do not believe there is reason to panic on the price front. Just as I did not worry when price increases were running below 2 percent, I am willing to tolerate temporarily overshooting the 2 percent level in the case of supply shocks, as long as inflation expectations are firmly anchored. But given that the inflation rate has been accelerating organically, I don’t believe there is room for complacency.\n\nLessons from Duck Hunting\n\nOne has to bear in mind that monetary policy has to lead economic developments. Monetary policy is a bit like duck hunting. If you want to bag a mallard, you don’t aim where the bird is at present, you aim ahead of its flight pattern. To me, the flight pattern of the economy is clearly toward increasing employment and inflation that will sooner than expected pierce through the tolerance level of 2 percent.\n\nSome economists have argued that we should accept overshooting our 2 percent inflation target if it results in a lower unemployment rate. Or a more fulsome one as measured by participation in the employment pool or the duration of unemployment. They submit that we can always tighten policy ex post to bring down inflation once this has occurred.\n\nI would remind them that June’s unemployment rate of 6.1 percent was not a result of a fall in the participation rate and that the median duration of unemployment has been declining. I would remind them, also, that monetary policy is unable to erase structural unemployment caused by skills mismatches or educational shortfalls. More critically, I would remind them of the asymmetry of the economic risks around full employment. The notion that “we can always tighten” if it turns out that the economy is stronger than we thought it would be or that we’ve overshot full employment is dangerous. Tightening monetary policy once we have pushed past sustainable capacity limits has almost always resulted in recession, the last thing we need in the aftermath of the crisis we have just suffered.\n\nDiluting the Punch from 108 Proof\n\nSo, what to do?\n\nOne might posit that by tapering our large-scale asset purchases with an eye to eliminating them in October, we have begun advance targeting with an eye to living up to our congressional mandate. My sense is that ending our large-scale asset purchases this fall, however, will not be enough.\n\nMany financial pundits protest that weaning the markets of über-accommodation, however gradually, risks wreaking havoc, so dependent on central bank largess have the markets become. As a former market operator, I am well aware of this risk. As I have said repeatedly, a bourbon addict doesn’t go from Wild Turkey to cold turkey overnight. But even if we stop adding to the potency of the financial punchbowl by finally ending our large-scale asset purchases in October, the punch is still 108 proof.[5] It remains intoxicating stuff.\n\nI believe the time to dilute the punch is close upon us. The FOMC could take two steps to accomplish this after ending our large-scale asset purchases.\n\nFirst, in October, we could begin tapering our reinvestment of maturing securities and begin incrementally shrinking our portfolio. I do not think this would have significant impact on the economy. Some might worry that paring our reinvestment in MBS might hurt the housing market. But I believe the demand for housing is sufficiently robust to continue improving despite a small rise in mortgage rates. The economy is improving. An acceleration of income growth that will result will likely buttress a recovery in housing and compensate for the loss of momentum that occurred during the winter freeze. (As a sidebar, I note that according to the National Association of Realtors, overseas buyers and new immigrants accounted for $92 billion, or 7 percent, worth of home purchases in the U.S. in the 12 months ended in March, with one-fourth of those purchases coming from Chinese buyers. As Californians, you might find it of interest that Los Angeles was the top destination for real estate searches from China on realtor.com; San Francisco was second; Irvine was third.[6])\n\nImportantly, I think that reducing our reinvestment of proceeds from maturing securities would be a good first step for the markets to more gently begin discounting the inevitable second step: that early next year, or potentially sooner depending on the pace of economic improvement, the FOMC may well begin to raise interest rates in gradual increments, finally beginning the process of policy normalization.\n\nProtecting the Fed as a Political Nuisance\n\nI mentioned at the onset that I think it imperative that the Fed be wary of giving rise to concerns that we will be politically pliant. I’ll conclude with some comments on this, especially since congressional hearings are currently underway to consider structural changes that might be called for on the occasion of the Fed’s 100th anniversary.\n\nA little history helps put current events in perspective. When the German Reichsbank was formed in 1871, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck was reportedly taken aside by his most trusted adviser, Gerson Bleichröder, and warned “… that there would be occasions when political considerations would have to override purely economic judgments and at such times too [politically] independent a central bank would be a nuisance.”[7]\n\nIt is no small wonder that the political considerations of the First World War and the impulse to override what might have been the purely economic judgments of Germany’s central bank led to the hyperinflation of the Weimar Republic and the utter destruction of the German economy.\n\nAt great personal risk, former Fed Chair Paul Volcker made clear that the Federal Reserve would not bequeath a similar destiny to the United States. Those of us who are the current trustees of the Fed’s reputation—the FOMC—must be especially careful that nothing we do appears to be politically motivated. In nourishing growth of the economy and employment, we must avoid erring on the side of coddling inflation to compensate for the inability of fiscal and regulatory policymakers in the legislative and executive branches to do their job. We must not flinch from insisting that our work is best done in a deliberate manner and never, ever for the sake of satisfying the voyeurism of the media or politicians. We must all, Federal Reserve principals and staff, and ordinary citizens alike, continue to protect the independence of the Fed and its ability to be a political nuisance.\n\nAnd now, Willow, in the best tradition of central banking, I will do my best to avoid answering any questions you and the audience might have.\n\nThank you.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "May 17, 2014 Smithfield, R.I.\n\nBefore I begin my formal remarks, I want the candidates for degrees to think about the fact that over 5,000 people are here today to celebrate your success. These are your parents and grandparents, cousins, uncles and aunts; your brothers and sisters; your friends; your teachers and coaches and counselors. They have been by your side through joyful moments and less-joyful ones. They have encouraged you. They have believed in you. And they have occasionally badgered and hectored you and … driven you nuts. All to good effect. They are here with glad and happy hearts to celebrate your admission to the society of educated men and women. You will be applauded by them many times today. But I want you, the graduating class, to turn the table on them and give them a round of applause. So stand up, turn around, put your hands together and give them a cheer. Thank them for loving you.\n\nNow, please be seated.\n\nI also want to salute the outgoing chairman of the Bryant University board of trustees, Michael Edward Fisher, ’67. I want to thank him not only for his six years as chairman and for his total devotion to Bryant, but also for doing his family proud—especially his little brother … me.\n\nBlessed to Be Americans\n\nMike Fisher and I grew up in what can most charitably be described as “unusual circumstances.” Our father started out his life in conditions right out of Charles Dickens: At the age of 5 years and 2 months, he was arrested for begging for food and sentenced to seven years in Australia’s harshest prison, a God-awful place called Westbrook Reformatory.[1] He was spared the destiny of most inmates there—he was released quickly and lived to see better days—but to say he grew up rough is an understatement. Our mother, born in a small South African outpost where Norwegians, Swedes and Danes carved a life out of the “bush,” lost her father at the age of 4 and was raised by a single mom who cooked for a boarding house. Neither of our parents had a formal education. But both were smart and ambitious for a better life. What did they do? They came to America. It was here that their family flourished.\n\nIf you are ever tempted to doubt what hardworking immigrants bring to our shores and the power and moral imperative of a free economy or American-style democracy, think twice. Only in America could two sons of a once-homeless beggar and the daughter of a boarding-house cook become what you see here on this stage today: One the distinguished chairman of the board of trustees of Bryant University, and the other a policymaker for the most important central bank in the world who is somehow deemed worthy of receiving an honorary doctorate and being chosen as speaker for the 151st commencement of this fine university. We are blessed to be Americans.\n\nThe Sages of the Ages\n\nNow, the only thing that stands between you and receiving your Bryant degree is … me. I will speak quickly and take up just a few moments of your time before you celebrate your accomplishments.\n\nBy now, you have taken enough writing courses to know the tongue-in-cheek definition of a good essay: It is a collection of other people’s thoughts disguised as your own![2] Most graduation speeches are no different. The standard routine for a commencement speaker is to dig through Bartlett’s or the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations or resort to Google and Wikiquote to find something said by some sage that will grace a graduation ceremony with a lesson students can take with them as they go off into this mysterious and challenging world.\n\nTo find something profound that I might pinch for your amusement today, I pored over the sayings of the great minds through time: Plato, Socrates, Mencius, Muhammad, St. Paul and St. Augustine, Voltaire, Martin Luther, Mother Teresa … Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber.\n\nThe maxims put forward by the sages of the ages are inspiring, but you already know them or you would not be where you are today: Be disciplined; be prepared; be loyal and thrifty and brave; always question conventional wisdom; take risks; push the envelope; be true to yourself; never promise more than you can deliver; never compromise your integrity; don’t waste your talents; never forget that you have been given those talents in order to do good; never, ever, ever, ever give up the pursuit of excellence.\n\nThese are all wise maxims. But, truth be told, it would save time and expedite many a graduation ceremony if organizers would forgo a commencement speaker and simply remind the graduating class to read and, throughout life, reread the Old and New Testament or the Quran or Confucius or Shakespeare—the ultimate sources of almost every graduation speech I have ever read or listened to.\n\nFor example, it would tax the capacity of the most powerful search engine to pull up the countless commencement speakers who have lifted and adapted variations of Shakespeare’s lines in King Henry VI, Part 2, Act 4, Scene VII that “ignorance is the curse of God, [k]nowledge the wing wherewith we fly to heaven.”\n\nDiana Sorensen’s Dictum\n\nOne of the most intriguing living thinkers, Diana Sorensen, the dean of arts and humanities at Harvard University, defines a knowledgeable graduate taking wing as follows:\n\n“He or she is competent in making discerning judgments with tools derived from science, engineering, social science, the arts and humanities. He or she should be a persuasive speaker who can articulate the reasons for his positions; who can write with clarity, elegance and conceptual power; an innovator who will take risks but first makes sure the limb they go out on is a sturdy one; a creative individual who has faced challenges posed by artistic production and experimentation; a global citizen who can speak, read, write in at least a second language; and who will learn what it takes to negotiate different world views emanating from different cultural traditions, a tolerant yet rigorous thinker whose moral compass is guided by ethical reasoning.”[3]\n\nClass of 2014, I don’t want to put any pressure on you! But that pretty much summarizes the skill set we all hope you have started to acquire at Bryant and will now go on to hone in life.\n\nBabe Fisher and John Paul Jones\n\nPreparing to speak to you today, I asked: How might I, a central banker whose musings are given to the arcana of economic and monetary policy, possibly improve upon the wisdom of the ultimate sources? Not easily. So I dug deep into my memory bank and called upon a source more erudite than the lessons of the Bible or the Quran, Confucius or Shakespeare, and even more insightful than Diana Sorensen—Mike’s and my mother, Magnhild Andersen Fisher, whom everybody called “Babe.”\n\nBabe Fisher never enjoyed the benefit of the type of education you have received. Yet she was a wise woman. She was a kind of female Nordic Yogi Berra who dispensed exquisite pearls of wisdom to her boys. One is especially germane for this ceremony. Our mother would say: “Never let your brains go to your head.” The pun is horrific but the message is profound: To achieve success, you will need to keep your superb education and your considerable talent in perspective. Brains and the gift of talent are necessary, but they are insufficient for success in life.\n\nTime and again, in business and universities and government we see instances in which women and men of towering intellect get far at first but ultimately snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. They do so because they have forgotten to develop their emotional quotient with the same devotion they applied to developing their intelligence quotient. My heartfelt advice to you is to work as hard on expanding your EQ as you have on harnessing your IQ.\n\nYou all have great futures ahead of you. You will get there just as fast, and enjoy it much more, if you remember that a sound mind resides most comfortably in a sound, well-rounded person and that a sound, well-rounded person has more than a superior education and brain. The whole person is as important an achievement for those few who have been admitted to the “society of educated men and women” as is the achievement of intellectual excellence.\n\nAs a former midshipman, I have always been inspired by the creed of the father of the Navy, John Paul Jones, as written by his biographer Augustus Buell. “It is by no means enough that an officer of the Navy should be a capable mariner. He must be that, of course, but also a great deal more. He should be as well a gentleman of liberal education, refined manners, punctilious courtesy, and the nicest sense of personal honor. He should be the soul of tact, patience, justice, firmness, and charity. … Every commander should keep constantly before him the great truth, that to be well obeyed, he must be perfectly esteemed.”\n\nI would say that Jones (or Buell) nailed it. Take the naval reference and the gender bias out, and you have the ultimate guide for all of you who depart Bryant today aspiring to lead: You must be more than smart and have more than a mighty intellect; you must develop the whole woman, the whole man to be a leader in whatever field you chose.\n\nA Smattering of Latin\n\nWhich brings me to the last requirement for most all commencement orations—a smattering of Latin. Commencement speakers at great schools seem to delight in showing off their command of an ancient tongue. Many a commencement speaker might have concluded this afternoon’s remarks with labor omnia vincit—a stern reminder that labor conquers all things. It is true, indeed, that you can’t rest on your laurels or your good family name or a Bryant education or just plain good luck. You have to work hard and sweat to succeed. And in doing so, you have to remember mens sana in corpore sano—a sound mind resides best in a sound body.\n\nBut that is way too ponderous. This is, after all, a festive day! So I will conclude with this: “Bubbus, sed possum explicarle, non sed possum comprehendere.”\n\nFor those of you unschooled in the language of the ancient Romans, that is Texas-ized, distorted Latin for “Bubba, I can explain it to you, but I can’t understand it for you.”\n\nThis afternoon I have done my best to explain to the Class of 2014 that success comes to those who best put their talents in context and who connect their substantial intellectual achievement to an equally developed emotional capacity. Those of us who lead cerebral lives must constantly strive to elevate our people skills to a level equal to our intellectual skills. I can explain that to you ad nauseam (aha! Another Latin phrase!). But you must come to understand it on your own.\n\nAnd if you do—if you go through your promising lives remembering that the “whole person is the best person”—my guess is that someday one of you in the Class of 2014 will be standing at this very podium giving the commencement speech to some future generation of graduates and their thousands of supporters and admirers. And having the greatest pleasure a speaker can have: Quoting your very own mom.\n\nCongratulations, God bless you and good luck!\n\nThank you.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "May 9, 2014 New Orleans, Louisiana\n\nThank you, Drake (Mills). Your service as president of the Federal Reserve Board’s Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council is greatly appreciated. You are kind to have a Texan come speak to you and your fellow Louisiana bankers, though this is not without precedent: The great blues guitarist and singer Clarence Garlow may have been born in Louisiana, but he had long lived in Texas before he recorded “Bon Ton Roula” in 1949 and gave New Orleans the reputation of the American city where les bon temps rouler.\n\nIt would be hard to say that the good times are rolling for community bankers, though the pace and rhythm of the economies of the U.S. and Louisiana and your next-door neighbor, Texas, are getting stronger daily.\n\nI have been outspoken as to why our community banks feel besieged. Everyone in this room and their sister or brother knows what I preach about the continuing problem of banks considered “too big to fail” and the witches’ brew that was concocted by Congress, known as Dodd–Frank. My colleagues at the Dallas Fed and I submit that Louisiana’s and the nation’s community and regional banks play on an uneven playing field against the giant money-center banks. The Fed is coming down hard on the big guys to ensure they are adequately capitalized and liquid. We are using all means within our power to make sure they never again place the American taxpayer at risk by bringing the financial system to its knees. But the fact remains that the big banks have a greater share of the deposit market than ever, are coming into our communities and regions to lend money on terms and at prices that any banker with a memory cell knows from experience usually end in tears, and are putting independent bankers in a precarious position.\n\nAnd as to Dodd–Frank, I am skeptical that the bureaucracy and rules and regulations this massive legislative initiative has created, even with the careful execution by the Fed, will vanquish too big to fail—the law’s very intention as stated in its preamble. But of this I am certain: It has made the lives of community and regional banks vastly more complicated. Like almost anything that comes out of the U.S. Congress, it has primarily been a boon to lawyers and consultants and compliance officers, adding to expenses but doing little to help you grow your businesses.\n\nWe at the Dallas Fed are acutely conscious of this. We think of Dodd–Frank as akin to what Dr. Seuss once wrote about medicine:\n\n\n\nInterest margins for community and regional banks have been shrinking for some 20 years. To be sure, the low interest rates the Fed has engineered to bring the economy out of the death spiral threatened by the Financial Panic of 2007–09 exacerbated pressures on margins as we awaited the strengthening economy we are now beginning to experience. But adding the pills and the bills of extra layers of compliance and legal expenses generated by Dodd–Frank has compounded the difficulty of passing on profitable franchises to your banking heirs.\n\nThis is why, Systemwide, the Fed has been sensitive to the situation of banks under $50 billion, and especially sensitive to the situation of banks with less than $10 billion in footings. To be sure, we are as committed as ever to safety and soundness and the application of the law; we always have been and always will be. But at the Dallas Fed, we believe we can apply the requisite discipline required to safeguard our banking system in a way that is beneficial to regional and community banks. We and our fellow Federal Reserve Banks have worked hard to instill a constructive and interactive relationship, rather than a hostile, purely formulaic one, with the banks we supervise. You might have noted that Janet Yellen’s speech of May 1 to the Independent Community Bankers was titled “Tailored Supervision of Community Banks.” The Federal Reserve banks take this charge seriously.\n\nThis is no idle claim. Just looking at the Eleventh District, we are increasingly being petitioned by banks for membership in the Federal Reserve System. The number of state member banks in the Dallas Fed district increased by 8 percent in 2012, by 19 percent in 2013, and we have already increased membership an annualized 26 percent in the first three months of 2014.\n\nSo I would just say this to those of you who are madder than (bleep!) about what Congress and the regulators have wrought: The Federal Reserve knows what community and regional banks do for their communities. We appreciate that you are the backbone for the homeowners, small businesses, service clubs and school sports teams and scouts and churches and myriad other activities that make for better communities. We want you not only to endure, but to succeed and grow. And we want to make sure you play on an even playing field with those who have legions of white-shoe lawyers and K Street lobbyists you couldn’t dream of affording.\n\nI wanted to just say that at the outset.\n\nMonetary Policy Going Forward: De-Spiking the Punch Bowl 10 Ounces at a Time\n\nNow, if you will indulge me, I want to speak of the direction of monetary policy from here onward.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is in the process of winding down its massive purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. At our last meeting, in recognition that the economy is improving and acknowledging that we have generated massive amounts of excess reserves among depository institutions operating in the U.S., we voted to reduce our purchases to a combined $45 billion per month, on the path to eliminating them at the earliest practicable date. Speaking only for myself as a voting member, barring some destabilizing development in the real economy that comes out of left field, I will continue to vote for the pace of reduction we have undertaken, reducing by $10 billion per meeting our purchases and eliminating them entirely at the October meeting with a final reduction of $15 billion.\n\nI was not for this program, popularly known as QE3, to begin with. I doubted its efficacy and was convinced that the financial system already had sufficient liquidity to finance recovery without providing tinder for future inflation. But I lost that argument in the fall of 2012, and I am just happy that we will be rid of the program soon enough.\n\nI am often asked why I do not support a more rapid deceleration of our purchases, given my agnosticism about their effectiveness and my concern that they might well be leading to froth in certain segments of the financial markets. The answer is an admission of reality: We juiced the trading and risk markets so extensively that they became somewhat addicted to our accommodation of their needs. You may remember the “taper tantrum” market operators threw last spring when we broached the idea of temperance. It went over about as big as would saying you wanted to ban Hurricanes and other happy-making libations here in New Orleans!\n\nPreventing Market Seizures and the DTs\n\nUntil just recently, Herb Kelleher was chairman of the Dallas Fed board. I can safely say that I had the funniest chairman of any Federal Reserve Bank, and one of the smartest ever. Herb is not only the iconic founder of Southwest Airlines, but he is also an iconic consumer of Wild Turkey Bourbon. A wise man, he advised me that you can’t go from Wild Turkey to cold turkey overnight. So despite having argued against spiking the punchbowl to the degree we did, I have accepted that the prudent course of action and the best way to prevent the onset of market seizures and delirium tremens is to gradually reduce and eventually eliminate the flow of excess liquidity we have been supplying. The financial markets now seem to be unperturbed by and appear to be fully discounting the reduction pattern I am supporting.\n\nYou should bear in mind that the Fed works directly only with depository institutions. And that they represent only a fifth or less of the credit markets in the U.S. And yet as I speak, depository institutions, including foreign banks doing business in the United States, have $2.5 trillion in excess reserves on the books of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks. So one would be hard pressed to say that ending our asset purchases, which the depository institutions from which we buy them deposit back with us as excess reserves, would deny the economy needed liquidity.\n\n“Normalizing” Policy\n\nThe focus of our discussions now is when and how to “normalize” monetary policy. Given that we work directly with only 20 percent or less of the highly developed U.S. credit intermediation system, this becomes a complicated matter. It raises questions, for example, about whether we should focus on the federal funds rate, which has been our traditional fulcrum, or some other measure, such as the rate we pay on excess reserves or that we pay on overnight reverse repos or some mix thereof. You can expect to hear more about this as time passes. Today, I am going to focus on another aspect of “normalization,” and that is: Once we have wound down QE3, when are we likely to raise the short-term rate that anchors the yield curve?\n\nIn the parlance of the trade, market operators and bankers alike are seeking “forward guidance” about our intentions. I spoke about this at length in a recent speech in Hong Kong, and I refer you to that speech if you need a sleeping aid this evening.[1]\n\nThe Advent of the Dots\n\nThe intense focus on when we are likely to raise the overnight rate is understandable. I was a banker in my previous life, before migrating to portfolio management; I spent 20 years in both professions before going into public service so as to “pay it back.” As a banker and market operator, I naturally wanted to eliminate uncertainty as much as possible. The adage “don’t fight the Fed,” was prevalent then, as it is now, so I would garner as much knowledge as possible about future Federal Reserve intentions and moves in order to position my book.\n\nThen, we had little information. The FOMC under Paul Volcker did not even announce its decisions, and the market was left to discover them on its own. Later, under Alan Greenspan, the FOMC began the process of releasing information about decisions taken, but any clues as to future intentions required one to divine some signal from the chairman’s almost mystical pronouncements and oracular circumlocution. Chairman Ben Bernanke worked with the FOMC to instill greater transparency under the assumption that providing as much information as we can enlightens markets so as to modulate the possible disruption of surprises and allows decision-makers—from consumers to businesses to bankers and investors—to plan forward. To this end, we now release copious amounts of information, including the forecasts of economic activity and the year-end level at which we see the rate on overnight money trading, as foreseen by each individual FOMC participant under his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy.\n\nWe call this exercise the Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP for short. We release it quarterly. I draw your attention to it because it has become something of a phenomenon among analysts preoccupied with the entrails of policymaking and has taken on a life of its own. You read about it in the papers and get analysis of it from market soothsayers. Yet, I want to caution you against becoming overly preoccupied with the FOMC’s SEP. In my less than humble opinion, it is a flawed tool. Let me explain why.\n\nHere is what the last SEP release for the fed funds rate looked like. It provided the FOMC participants’ projections for the overnight rate at year-end for the next three years and beyond to the “longer run,” as foreseen from March 19:\n\n\n\nYou can see why it is referred to in the business as “the dot chart.” The best guesses of the entire panoply of participants in FOMC deliberations—19 when we have a full complement (the 12 Fed bankers and the maximum of seven governors appointed by the president subject to approval of the Senate)—are summarized in dots with the expected level on the “y-axis” and the year at the end of which it is thought likely to occur on the “x-axis.”\n\nI use the term “best guesses” deliberately. The participants in the FOMC have sophisticated econometric models, a deep knowledge of theory and a great breadth of experience to draw upon. But truth be told, however we dress up our forecasts as rigorous analysis, they are no more than the very best educated guesses of the superbly trained but still human staffs of the 12 Fed bankers and the active governors.\n\nAnd the composition of those among the FOMC participants who actually vote on policy changes periodically. With the departure of Governor Jeremy Stein at the end of this month, we will have eight people, including me, who vote on policy for the remainder of this year. We are hopeful that the full Senate will confirm the two governors who have now come out of the Senate Banking Committee, but we don’t know when that will occur. That will bring the total number of voters to 10. But the composition of those 10 voters will change each year going forward.\n\nHere, for example, is how the voters have changed just since last year and how the voting group will morph on into 2016, with those names in red indicating new positions or votes.\n\n\n\n\n\nDot-ology or Doxology?\n\nEven though the Fed has a remarkable assembly of the best economic thinkers on the planet (present company excluded), no one on the FOMC is a seer and none possess Nostradamus-like insight, even when looking out just a couple of quarters; and, given that the roster of those who actually vote on policy is constantly changing, it is a wonder that the analytical community and market economists have become so fixated on “the dots.”\n\nSome analysts practically worship the dots. They have become analytical idols around which a doxology of sorts has developed (“Praise dots from whom all insights flow”). Others consider their fallibility but still spill plenty of ink slicing and dicing them.\n\nFor example, here is a foray into dot-ology sent out on April 23 by the highly regarded chief international economist of Deutsche Bank, Torsten Slok: “One important question is how confident FOMC members are in their forecasts. One way to measure this is to look at the standard deviation around FOMC members’ forecasts of where they think the fed funds rate will be in two years’ time, i.e. look at the standard deviation of the dots in the Fed’s dot chart. … At their latest meeting the FOMC members felt more certain about the coming hike in the fed funds rate than they did a year ago.”[2]\n\nI cite Mr. Slok’s analysis only as an example of an entire field of study—a veritable industry—that has evolved around “the dots.” So extensive is the preoccupation with this that it would not surprise me if Harrah’s Casino here on Canal Street eventually starts taking bets on how the dots will shift from quarter to quarter.\n\nSurely, economists of high repute are aware of the imperfections of this exercise and the fundamental problem with date-based forward guidance (projecting a schedule for future policy changes). We, on the FOMC, certainly are.\n\nDr. Seuss or Strother Martin?\n\nThere have been suggestions from outside and within the Fed on how to better present our “best guesses” as to when we will move the base rate for anchoring the yield curve. For example, some have suggested identifying which dots belong to current voting members of the FOMC. Others have suggested that we report only the median of responses or the median of voter responses, rather than the entire array of dots. But neither of these approaches would do anything to enlighten the markets as to the views of future voters, nor would they overcome the underlying problem with date-based forward guidance.\n\nWhat to do? If the dot chart creates confusion, one option would be to dispense with the exercise altogether. Having evoked Dr. Seuss earlier, I can imagine his bidding the dots farewell with some ditty like this:\n\n\n\nYet expressing the FOMC participants’ perceptions of, and possible reactions to, an assortment of future scenarios—however often the committee’s composition may change—does strike me as having some merit, if only to give markets insight into how the central bank might react under different circumstances.\n\nIn the parlance of the trade, this is called “state-based” guidance. Yet here, too, we have struggled. For example, until two meetings ago, we used an unemployment figure of 6½ percent as a point sometime after which we would begin to consider pulling back on monetary accommodation, then decided this wasn’t quite the ticket.\n\nThis may be a little more inside baseball than you expected to hear today, but here’s the point: Expect the Fed to continue refining its communications. We are getting better at it. But to invoke the immortal words from the chain gang captain portrayed by Strother Martin in the 1967 movie Cool Hand Luke: “What we’ve got here is failure to communicate.” We are working on it so that you and other bankers, market operators, businesses and consumers will develop the best possible insight into how your monetary authority will behave. I expect that our new Chair, Janet Yellen, will play a significant role here as she uses her press conferences to explain what simply cannot be communicated with a series of dots or within the statement we release after each meeting.\n\nAlas, There Is Congress\n\nNow mind you, your monetary authority—your Federal Reserve—does not hold every card to your future in its hand. No matter how clearly we communicate, no matter how expertly we tailor our supervision of your banks, no matter how we conduct monetary policy, our work is necessary but not sufficient to the success of the Louisiana, Texas and U.S. economies. The fiscal authorities—Congress and the executive branch—must do their job to provide the proper tax, spending and regulatory incentives for businesses to take advantage of the cheap and abundant money the Fed has made possible and put it to work to grow, expand their payrolls and let America truly prosper.\n\nI will spare you my thoughts on Congress (it is not very central banker-like to resort to profanity). All I will say is that you and your neighbors and friends and customers are the ones who elect people to office and whether you are a \"D\" or an \"R,\" you need only look at yourself in the mirror to see who is in charge of placing the right people in office to get the job done of putting the American economy back on track. I’d say you have some serious work to do here.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor today, just bear in mind that the Fed is doing its utmost to be an enlightened regulator of your banks. For the economy as a whole, there is abundant liquidity to finance economic expansion, and the FOMC will assure that it remains affordable as long as the prospect of inflation rising above its 2 percent target remains in abeyance. It is too early to say that the economy can declare laissez les bon temps rouler. But for you bankers in this audience today, you might be forgiven if you kick up your heels a little bit while you are in New Orleans … though the curmudgeonly old Fed will be watching to make sure that for its part, you don’t let things get out of hand.\n\nThank you, Drake. Thank you all.\n\nNow, in the best tradition of central banking, I would be happy to avoid answering any questions you have.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "April 4, 2014 Hong Kong\n\nThank you, Alice (Mong). It is always an honor to speak before the Asia Society anywhere in the world but especially here in Hong Kong, one of my favorite cities. I was in Hong Kong during the transition ceremonies in 1997 when the White House called to ask if I would become deputy U.S. trade representative. It was a position in which I served for four years under President Clinton, and it put me on the path to high-level public service. That and my love for the spectacular food here have cemented Hong Kong in my heart. Thank you for inviting me to stop here on my way to Beijing.\n\nI want to talk today about “forward guidance” in monetary policy. It is the subject du jour of central bankers. We’ve seen it popularized by the Bank of Canada and Bank of England, and it figured prominently in the statement recently released by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the Federal Reserve after our meeting of March 18–19 and again during the post-meeting press conference of the Fed Chair, Janet Yellen. It is front and center on the agenda of the FOMC.\n\nTo understand forward guidance and its prominence in current discussions within monetary policy circles, it helps to retrace recent history.\n\nAdieu Quantitative Easing\n\nTo encourage economic recovery from the debacle of the financial crisis of 2007–09, the FOMC cut interest rates to near zero. The Fed introduced an array of special lending facilities during the most panicked stage of the crisis. These credit and liquidity programs were largely self-liquidating as market functioning improved. But still being “zero bound,” we embarked upon a program of massively expanding the Fed’s balance sheet, referred to internally as “large-scale asset purchases” and popularly known as quantitative easing (QE). By buying copious quantities of longer-term U.S. Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities (MBS), our balance sheet has grown from slightly under $900 billion prior to the crisis to $4.3 trillion at present.\n\nWhen the Fed buys a Treasury note or bond or an MBS, we pay for it, putting money out into the economy with the expectation that the money will be used by banks and other creditors and investors to finance job-creating investment, the purchase of homes and other expansive economic activity.\n\nThus far, much of the money we have pushed out into the economy has been stored away rather than expended to the desired degree. For example, we have seen a huge buildup in the reserves of the depository institutions of the United States. Less than a fifth of commercial credit in the highly developed U.S. capital markets is extended through depository institutions. Yet depository institutions alone have accumulated a total of $2.57 trillion in excess reserves—money that is sitting on the sidelines rather than being loaned out into the economy. That’s up from a norm of around $2 billion before the crisis.\n\nThe Fed’s large-scale asset purchases dramatically and more broadly impacted credit markets. The U.S. credit markets are awash in liquidity.\n\nAs of March 14, our par holdings of fixed-rate MBS exceeded 30 percent of the outstanding stock of those securities. Through these purchases, we have driven down mortgage rates and helped rekindle the U.S. housing market.\n\nWe now own just shy of 24 percent of the stock of Treasury coupon securities. Having concentrated our purchases of Treasuries further out on the yield curve, and done so in size, we have driven nominal interest rates across the credit spectrum to lows not seen in over a half century.\n\nThis has allowed U.S. businesses to restructure their balance sheets, manage their earnings per share through share buybacks financed with bargain-basement debt issuance, bolster stock prices through enhanced dividend payouts and position themselves for financing growth once they see the whites of the eyes of greater certainty about their economic future. By driving nominal interest rates to half-century lows, we have also reduced the hurdle rate by which future cash flows of publicly traded businesses are discounted. Thus, through financial engineering, we have helped bolster a roaring bull market for equities: The indexes for stocks have nearly tripled from the lows reached in March 2009.\n\nAlongside these signs of rebound have been some developments that give rise to caution. I have spoken of these in recent speeches, echoing concerns I have raised in FOMC discussions:\n\nThe former funds manager in me sees these as yellow lights. The central banker in me is reminded of the mandate to safeguard financial stability. As I said recently in a speech in Mexico, we must watch these developments carefully lest we become responsible for raising the ghost of irrational exuberance.\n\nIt is clear to me that we have a liquidity pool that is more than sufficiently deep and wide enough nationwide to finance job-creating capital expansion and reduce labor market “slack.” But that will happen only if and when our fiscal authorities—the Congress and the president—are able to muster the courage to craft tax, spending and regulatory incentives for job-creating enterprises to mobilize liquidity for expansion and payroll growth.\n\nThus far, inflation has yet to raise its ugly head, and inflation expectations as measured by consumer surveys and market-traded instruments have remained stolid. However, with each passing day, constantly adding massive amounts to the monetary base will inevitably present a significant challenge to the FOMC, which must ultimately manage this high-power money so that it does not become fuel for sustained inflation above the committee’s 2 percent target once it is activated and flows into the economy.\n\nThus, I was more than supportive of the collective decision of the FOMC to begin cutting back on our rate of accumulation of assets beginning in December. Over the course of our recent meetings, we have cut back from accumulating $85 billion per month in Treasuries and MBS to a present rate of $55 billion per month. This is still somewhat promiscuous. Even with the taper, the recent decline of mortgage supply has driven our absorption of the MBS market to 85 percent of fixed-rate MBS issuance. The fall in net MBS supply is outpacing the taper.\n\nAt the current reduction in the run rate of accumulation, the exercise known as QE3 will terminate in October (when I project we will hold more than 40 percent of the MBS market and almost a fourth of outstanding Treasuries). We will then be back to managing monetary policy through the more traditional tool of the overnight lending rate that anchors the yield curve.\n\nEnter Forward Guidance\n\nThis is no small matter. Quantitative easing has made life easy not only for corporate treasurers and homeowners and consumers burdened by debt, but also for money market operators. It has run up the price of stocks and bonds mostly in straight-line fashion, and it has taken volatility out of the marketplace, allowing market operators and their clients to profit with little effort. The question of when and under what conditions the FOMC will begin to raise the base rate off the floor is understandably of intense interest.\n\nFor example, every quarter, FOMC participants each provide forecasts of the year in which they presently think the target overnight rate will be raised, based on what they individually consider to be the proper conduct of monetary policy. This has given rise to what I consider a rabid focus on the economic projections, or “dots,” that accompany our FOMC statements on a quarterly basis. Monty Python could almost have written a sketch on the pundits’ preoccupation with the dots.[4]\n\nTruth be told, although many of us have econometric models and all of us have a phenomenal team of economists who help us develop our projections, these estimates are, in the end, largely guesswork. Especially the further out in time they go. Yet the press and the markets focus on them as though they were the writ of all-knowing, all-seeing monetary sages. On Monday night, for example, there was much ado made about Janet Yellen noting in Chicago that the central tendency of our best guesses was that full employment would be somewhere between a 5.2 and 5.6 percent unemployment rate.\n\nIt is nonetheless helpful to contemplate what may be useful guideposts for deciding when to raise the base rate and how we may convey this to the markets. And so the FOMC is grappling with just what, in fact, we can provide the marketplace in the form of forward guidance about our future modus operandi.\n\nOdysseus or Apollo?\n\nResearch papers have addressed this subject. For example, some academic economists draw on Greek mythology to distinguish different techniques for crafting forward guidance, making a distinction between Odyssean and Delphic forms of guidance.\n\nThe Odyssean model involves committing to a policy rule or to a criterion for choosing between different policy alternatives. Policymakers tie themselves to the mast of this rule or criterion, sacrificing some of their short-run freedom of action in order to achieve what they hope will be superior outcomes over the long term. In monetary policy, commitment can in theory reduce the risk of future recession and more tightly control medium-horizon inflation expectations at the cost of a somewhat poorer near-term inflation or unemployment performance.\n\nCommitments come in lots of different flavors and styles, and forward guidance isn’t necessarily helpful or wise just because it’s Odyssean. Tying yourself to the mast isn’t an especially good idea if your ship is sinking, or if enemy forces are directing fire toward your deck. Committing to a particular path for the funds rate, or to a time schedule for funds-rate liftoff, is not something in which I or many of my colleagues have any interest. Commitments that are contingent on future economic conditions, in contrast, enjoy at least some support on the FOMC. President (Narayana) Kocherlakota of the Minneapolis Fed, for example, has notably proposed that the committee promise to delay liftoff at least until either the unemployment rate reaches 5 1/2 percent or forecasted inflation hits 2 1/4 percent (provided longer-term inflation expectations remain well-anchored, and possible risks to financial stability remain well-contained).\n\nMy own view is that commitments aren’t always credible, especially if they purport to extend far into the future. It’s hard to bind future policymakers, and it’s difficult to anticipate all the various economic circumstances that might arise down the road. As a general rule, then, the further into the future a commitment extends, the vaguer it tends to be. Along these lines, the FOMC periodically reiterates its commitment to do what it is legally mandated to do: pursue full employment, price stability and a stable financial system. But getting from there to an actual prescription for the funds rate isn’t straightforward. If it were, FOMC meetings wouldn’t take eight-plus hours of discussion and hundreds of pages of briefing materials.\n\nDelphic forward guidance is less binding than Odyssean guidance. Like the responses of the oracle of Apollo at Delphi, it is more obscure, more enigmatic. It amounts to saying, “Here’s what we think we are going to want to do if the economy evolves as we currently expect.” Delphic guidance clarifies your current thinking about future policy without making any promises—even contingent promises.\n\nOur current FOMC statement is chock-full of Delphic guidance. On asset purchases: “If incoming information broadly supports the committee’s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps ...” On the timing of liftoff: “The committee continues to anticipate ... that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends ...” On the post-liftoff path of the funds rate: “The committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the committee views as normal in the longer run.”\n\nAs a former practitioner, I can tell you that market operators prefer Odyssean guidance to Delphic guidance, and within the Odyssean model, tend to prefer inflexible, calendar-based guidance to guidance that’s either conditional or qualitative. Life in my former incarnation would naturally be much more pleasant if I could dial in the specific dates and levels of interest rate movements. But as a central banker, I am haunted by a comment made by Winston Churchill in 1926, shortly before things began to unravel in the global financial markets. Speaking at the Waldorf Hotel in London, he said: “In finance, everything that is agreeable is unsound and everything that is sound is disagreeable.”[5]\n\nI worry that the predictability of calendar-based commitments can quite possibly be unsound in two key dimensions. First, the quantitative moorings may be misplaced—especially given shifts in economic relationships following the worst downturn since the Great Depression. Second, I question if it is sound policy to remove all uncertainty or volatility from the market. I wonder whether being totally predictable may, at best, lead to a false complacency that can too easily be upset should we need to change course. At its worst, I fear calendar-based commitments can lead, perversely, to market instability by encouraging markets to overshoot, as they appear to be doing in some quarters at present. I say “calendar-based commitments,” even though the FOMC has tried to couch its calendar-based guidance in Delphic language. The problem is that guidance intended to be Delphic is, in practice, often given an Odyssean interpretation. Whether because of wishful thinking by market operators or because of policymaker inertia (it’s easier to stick with the previously announced plan than to explain a departure from that plan), the Delphic undergoes metamorphosis and becomes Odyssean.\n\nThus, I wonder if anything beyond the Delphic is practicable, as much as I might like to set our compass on autopilot. But even expressing meaningful forward guidance along more amorphous lines is challenging.\n\n‘We’ll See’:\n\nThe point is: Forward guidance can be a complicated monetary policy tool. I had an interesting discussion about this two weeks ago with a couple of the members of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). They noted that Chris Giles of the Financial Times has devoted a substantial amount of thoughtful attention to the discussion of forward guidance.\n\nIn Giles’ Money Supply blog post of Oct. 2, 2013, he wrote: “Forget triggers, thresholds, knockouts and long lists of conditions. Paul Fisher, the Bank of England’s head of markets, says everyone is wrong to think forward guidance is complicated. The policy was summarized in a single simple sentence of the [Bank of England’s] explanatory document, he said in a speech today. This is the sentence,” and I’m quoting Giles quoting Paul Fisher: “In essence, the MPC judges that, until the margin of slack within the economy has narrowed significantly, it will be appropriate to maintain the current exceptionally stimulative stance of monetary policy, provided that such an approach remains consistent with its primary objective of price stability and does not endanger financial stability.”\n\nTo a central banker, that may have seemed about as concise a Delphic statement as possible. But Giles suggested, “I’m sure we can all do better than that.” He took a stab at translating the sentence himself, suggesting that it meant “the MPC will let the recovery run for as long as it can,” but he invited others who might have “better, more elegant and more accurate translations” to submit them via social media. Later that day, he announced the best summation received. Forward guidance expressed in a two-word sentence: “We’ll see.”[6]\n\nThat about sums it up. The FOMC is seeking to make sure that we have a sustained recovery without giving rise to inflation or market instability. We will conduct monetary policy accordingly. Regardless of the way we may finally agree at the FOMC to write it out or have Chair Yellen explain it at a press conference, we really cannot say more than that.\n\nSo that’s where we are: “We’ll see.” Or as Deng Xiaoping would have phrased it: “We will cross the river by feeling the stones” (). We will feel the stones of the economy with the bottoms of our feet as central bankers and proceed accordingly.\n\nDraghi’s Old Man\n\nAt a recent meeting I attended in Frankfurt, Mario Draghi of the European Central Bank told of a man who needed a heart transplant. The doctor leveled with him that he had several choices, including the heart of a 75-year-old central banker. “I’ll take that one,” the man answered immediately. “Why?” the doctor asked. “Well,” said the man, “because it’s never been used.”\n\nAs was made clear in Chair Yellen’s speech in Chicago earlier this week, central bankers have hearts, and the Fed is working to harness monetary policy to relieve the plight of the cyclically unemployed. But we also need to be vigilant in making clear that we are obligated to maintain price stability and that allowing inflation to take grip is a cardinal sin for a central bank, for it is the cruelest of afflictions for all of society.\n\nJoachim Fels of Morgan Stanley noted that Draghi’s little joke serves as a reminder not that my colleagues and I at the Federal Reserve belong to a heartless tribe but that “central banking is about making rational, cool-headed and unemotional decisions often under difficult circumstances.”[7] We must conduct monetary policy in a cool-headed and unemotional manner in order to achieve both of the mandates Congress has given us—preserving price stability and achieving full employment—while avoiding financial market turbulence.\n\nThis is the very best we can offer you, whether you are from ancient Ithaca or Delphi or modern Hong Kong. Those who think we can be more specific in stating our intentions and broadcasting our every next move with complete certainty are, in my opinion, clinging to the myth that economics is a hard science and monetary policy a precise scientific procedure rather than the applied best judgment of cool-headed, unemotional decision-makers.\nWe will cross the river that separates us from a normalized economy and a normalized monetary policy by feeling the stones. We may slip on occasion, but you should not underestimate our intention to apply whatever talents we possess as policymakers to do what is right to advance economic prosperity while strictly adhering to our commitment of containing inflation and maintaining market stability.\n\nThank you.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "March 5, 2014 Mexico City, Mexico\n\nThank you, Luis [Robles], for that kind introduction. It is my great pleasure to be here tonight as the guest of the Association of Mexican Banks and reunited with my colleagues from Banco de México. I recently returned from Europe, where I met with leaders from the European Central Bank and the National Bank of Switzerland.\n\nI am very grateful to Governor Agustín Carstens for his hospitality. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas has enjoyed a long history of cooperation and consultation with the Banco de México. I like to call Banxico our sister bank. Agustín himself spent some time at the Dallas Fed when he was a young man, and we take pride in playing this small part in his accomplished career. For many years, the Dallas Fed’s El Paso Branch has held joint board meetings and informational exchanges with the Banco de México regional board of directors in Ciudad Juárez. Now our branches in Houston and San Antonio are holding similar joint meetings with their Banco de México counterparts. And Governor Carstens’ predecessor, Guillermo Ortiz, is an advisory board member of the Dallas Fed’s Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and the Banco de México enjoy a unique and mutually beneficial relationship.\n\nAs Guillermo and Agustín well know, there is also a personal dimension to the Dallas Fed’s relationship with the Banco de México. I grew up in Mexico City in the 1950s, attending elementary school not far from here. Spanish was my first language in school. To this day, I have many friends in El Norte who say I speak better Spanish than I do English, although that may be due to my Texas accent. Either way, I always proudly tell them, “¡No hablo español; hablo puro mexicano!” This evening, I will do my level best to speak to you in español mexicano rather than in inglés texano.\n\nUnprecedented U.S. Monetary Policy\n\nAs you surely know, and as I am happy to report, the Federal Open Market Committee (the “FOMC”), charged with crafting U.S. monetary policy, is winding down its extraordinary “quantitative easing” phase. The Great Recession demanded extraordinary policy, and the FOMC responded. Led by Chairman Bernanke, the FOMC met the financial crisis head-on in September 2007 and by the end of 2008 had lowered the federal funds rate to zero from 5.25 percent.\n\nOnce the full force of the financial crisis hit, after the failure of Lehman Brothers, the federal funds tool proved insufficient. First individual companies had to be rescued, then the banking system, and eventually the whole economy. Conventional thought held that there was little that policymakers could do after reaching the zero bound—when the central bank’s policy rate hit zero. But the FOMC thought otherwise.\n\nBy mid-2009, the gross domestic product (GDP) in the U.S. began to recover after contracting 4.3 percent. Progress was painfully slow. GDP eked out 1.3 percent growth in the third quarter and put the U.S. back on a growth path. Meanwhile, the labor market lagged. The unemployment rate was 9.6 percent, employment growth was still out of reach, and real wages were falling. The labor market is central to FOMC deliberations. While most other central banks, including Banco de México, are legally bound to only ensure price stability, U.S. policymakers are charged with a dual mandate: ensuring price stability and maximum employment. By the middle of 2009, the jobs deficit (jobs lost since the prerecession peak in employment) was 8 million and rising.\n\nThus, we embarked on an aggressive path of quantitative easing (QE), launching large-scale purchases of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities and U.S. housing agency debt. The first round of QE ran until March 2010, when the labor market had finally started recovering. By the conclusion of QE1, the Fed had infused the economy with $1.25 trillion in liquidity. Second and third rounds of quantitative easing were announced in November 2010 and September 2012, respectively.\n\nBy the time the Fed began tapering the pace of these asset purchases in December of 2013, the Fed’s balance sheet had ballooned from below $1 trillion to more than $4 trillion in just four years. Today, the Federal Reserve has an unprecedented volume and diversity of assets. Correspondingly, banks hold an unprecedented amount of reserves. Total reserves at depository institutions have skyrocketed from $45 billion before the crisis to $2.5 trillion today. The stock of bank reserves awaiting discharge into the economy through our banking system is vast and, troublingly, mostly unused.\n\nThere is plenty of money available for American businesses to work with. Consider this: In fourth quarter 2007, U.S. GDP was $14.7 trillion; at year-end 2013 it was an estimated $17.1 trillion. Had we continued on the path we were on before the crisis, real GDP would currently be roughly $20 trillion in size. That’s a third larger than it was in 2007. Yet the amount of money going unused in the banking system is 60 times greater now than at year-end 2007. It isn’t a lack of liquidity that is keeping businesses from putting people back to work.\n\nMoney’s Cheap and Abundant, Yet the Recovery Disappoints\n\nThe Federal Reserve has created an opportunity for others to act. Money is cheap and plentiful. The objective now is for banks to lend, consumers to borrow, and businesses to invest so jobs are created and economic activity expands. With such aggressive monetary policy, it is surprising that the economic recovery has languished. Notwithstanding recent data that show consumers are borrowing again, four and a half years into the economic recovery, employment still has not reached its prerecession level, making this by far the slowest of the 12 post-World War II U.S. recoveries.\n\nOne problem has been the sluggish pace of the recovery in the other advanced economies. The financial crisis was a global phenomenon, affecting advanced and emerging market economies alike. Yet the emerging market economies bounced back and in almost all cases have long since surpassed their precrisis levels of output. This has not been the case in the advanced economies.\n\nEurope and the euro zone, which have been hobbled by a series of sovereign debt crises in the wake of the financial crisis and the adoption of a single currency, remain important to the global economy, and problems there cannot help but have international repercussions. The good news is that European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi’s pledge in 2012 to “do whatever it takes” to stabilize the situation there seems to have worked and to have bought time for much-needed reforms. In conversations with President Draghi and the ECB governors last Friday, it was clear that recent data suggest the worst may be over.\n\nMeanwhile, in Japan, “Abenomics” seems to be succeeding in ending the decades-long deflation, though progress on structural reforms—crucial to restoring long-term growth—has been disappointing. There is an important lesson here, one to which I will return later: Monetary policy can only do so much. In the case of Japan, monetary policy can end the deflation that has characterized the economy since the late 1990s, but can do little to infuse long-run expansion unless it is accompanied by fiscal policy that implements structural change.\n\nBut the biggest problem the U.S. confronts is homegrown: political failure in Washington to act on the key issues holding the recovery hostage. Fiscal and regulatory uncertainty is a powerful deterrent to business investment. Going back to the earliest days of the current recovery, my business contacts have regularly complained of the fog of uncertainty emanating from Washington. They have consistently cited fiscal and regulatory uncertainty as major impediments to capital investment and expanding payrolls.\n\nUncertainty comes in many forms. In some cases it is major legislation such as the health care reform or financial regulation as in the Dodd Frank [Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection] Act. Fiscal issues have regularly constrained the recovery—the debt ceiling debacle in summer 2011, the last-minute resolution of the fiscal cliff in December 2012, the brute force sequester of 2013 and so on. Most vexing is not knowing how businesses will be taxed or how the federal government will shape future spending. This makes budgeting and planning capital outlays and payrolls into the future an uncertain process.\n\nIt is my personal opinion that the Fed has bought time for fiscal authorities to get their house in order, but four years later I am not sure we are much closer to that goal. It is true that Washington politicians stopped bickering long enough in December to pass a budget, the first budget in four years. And the projected budget deficit is just 3 percent of GDP this fiscal year, down from 4.1 percent in 2013 and 7 percent in 2012. After five years of outsized deficits, the U.S. is finally on par with Mexico, whose deficit throughout the recovery never exceeded 2.8 percent of GDP.\n\nYou might think that agreeing on a budget means the U.S. government can go about its business, taxing and spending and keeping the monuments open to tourists. But in the U.S. we have another obstacle, the debt ceiling. This ritual battle, which we have fought at least 87 times since the end of World War II, does not address the underlying imbalances at the root of our fiscal situation. Nevertheless, we revisit it regularly and did so in February when Congress actually approved raising the debt ceiling without a big fight. Last time, you may recall, things did not go so smoothly. The stock markets wobbled, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) issued warnings, and one of the credit rating agencies downgraded U.S. government debt.\n\nThe debt ceiling may be well-intentioned and put in place to protect our children from our own and prior generations’ excesses, but it has been completely ineffectual in stopping rising debt and may be contributing to the uncertainty that is holding up the recovery. U.S. debt held by the public has ballooned to 76 percent of GDP, up from 36 percent in 2007. The U.S. is nearing debt-to-GDP ratios not seen since the aftermath of World War II. In contrast, Mexico’s debt is relatively small, about 30 percent of GDP, although it too has increased, and is up from 20 percent in 2007.\n\nHere in Mexico as in the U.S., the recession worsened the fiscal situation by depressing tax revenues while spending rose. That said, the nations’ trajectories are quite different. While the growth of U.S. government debt has temporarily slowed, longer-term factors are expected to push the debt-to-GDP ratio to 100 percent by 2038 from where it will likely continue rising. Mexico’s debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to fall once the recently passed fiscal reform is fully implemented.\n\nThis era of unprecedented liquidity and low interest rates has presented the U.S. with at least three great opportunities:\n\nOne was to address the long-term fiscal outlook by reforming entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare. We must create a balanced system that will prevent future liabilities from spiraling out of control.\n\nA second was to pass regulatory reforms to lessen the risk of future financial-market crises and ensure too-big-to-fail entities never again place the U.S. in a position where taxpayer funds must be used to bail out bad private-sector actors.\n\nA third was to restructure government debt while long-term rates are at historic lows. Within the next four years, 58 percent of U.S. government debt will mature. And though short-term rates are low now, they won’t be low forever. When the existing debt matures, rates are sure to be higher and servicing the debt will take a bigger share out of the budget, leaving less to spend on everything else. One sobering statistic is that net interest payments on the debt are scheduled to nearly triple by the end of the decade, rising from $221 billion in fiscal year 2013 (1.3 percent of GDP) to $635 billion in fiscal year 2020 (2.8 percent of GDP).\n\nI would say that this era of cheap money is one of missed opportunities on all three of these fronts. To add insult to injury, there are increasing signs quantitative easing has overstayed its welcome: Market distortions and acting on bad incentives are becoming more pervasive.\n\nStock market metrics such as price to projected forward earnings, price-to-sales ratios and market capitalization as a percentage of GDP are at eye-popping levels not seen since the dot-com boom of the late 1990s. In the words of James Mackintosh, writer of the Financial Times column “The Short View,” a not insignificant number of stocks in the S&P 500 have valuations “that rely on belief in a financial fairy.” Margin debt is pushing up against all-time records. And, in the bond market, narrow spreads between corporate and Treasury debt reflect lower risk premia on top of already abnormally low nominal yields. We must monitor these indicators very carefully so as to ensure that the ghost of “irrational exuberance” does not haunt us again.\n\nQE Spillovers\n\nAs you well know, the effects of unprecedented monetary easing in the U.S. and other advanced economies do not stop at international borders. They spill over onto the rest of the world. Record-low interest rates engineered by central bankers have led investors to seek higher returns elsewhere, generating massive inflows of capital into emerging market economies (EME), including Mexico. Let’s not forget that capital flows to EMEs were large even before the crisis. That said, they rose further as quantitative easing gained momentum in the U.S. and other nations adopted similar policies. For example, U.S. capital stock as a share of home-country GDP rose from 11 percent to 17 percent in Brazil and from 18 percent to 25 percent in Mexico between 2008 and 2012. Capital flows were increasingly made up of portfolio investment rather than direct investment during this time.\n\nNews of Fed tapering in late spring last year reversed the flow of capital into EME-dedicated equity and bond funds, and emerging market currencies depreciated against the dollar. Sovereign debt yields rose sharply in vulnerable emerging market nations such as Brazil and Turkey. Sovereign debt spreads edged up in Mexico also, but significantly less so than in other EMEs. Much like in the morning after a party the night before, investors woke up sober and more discriminating.\n\nWhy Mexico Stands Apart\n\nThere are concerns that the outsized capital flows to EMEs during the QE era pushed down interest rates and led consumers and businesses to take on too much debt. Mexico seems better positioned than many other countries in terms of this risk exposure. While according to the Banco de Mexico, private lending is up 38 percent since its recession low in 2010, international comparisons based on World Bank figures show the rate of credit expansion in Mexico pales in comparison to other emerging market nations. Between 2009 and 2012, private lending as a share of GDP grew 5 percentage points in Mexico while jumping 20 percentage points in Brazil. The level of debt exposure is also lower in Mexico than in many other emerging market nations. Private lending as a share of GDP was 28 percent in Mexico in 2012, compared with 35 percent in Indonesia, 54 percent in Turkey and 68 percent in Brazil.\n\nOn my flight home from Zurich, I read about a bank with compliance failures; however, I have to say that as a whole, the Mexican banking system is quite healthy. Bank profits rose in 2013 and Mexican banks are well-capitalized, with an aggregate capital ratio of 16 percent as of year-end 2013. While four small banks failed year-end stress tests by the Comision Nacional Bancaria y de Valores (CNBV) and were asked to boost capital and diversify their portfolios, it was also the first year the regulator fully implemented the stringent Basel III capital rules. The share of nonperforming loans rose slightly; among commercial loans, this was partly due to changes in the accounting methodology, so it cannot fully be attributed to deteriorating credit quality.\n\nI am convinced that the biggest problem facing Mexico is not too much credit, but too little. That’s why the recently implemented financial reform is so important; that’s why its core objective is to boost credit.\n\nAnother advantage that Mexico has is plentiful foreign exchange reserves, about $180 billion, and a $73 billion standing line of credit with the IMF. Mexico has been amassing more foreign exchange reserves as other emerging market nations have seen them dwindle.\n\nWhile excess liquidity from the U.S. has found its way to all emerging markets, there is a palpable investor commitment to Mexico that sets it apart from the rest. At over $35 billion, 2013 was a record year for foreign direct investment in Mexico. Foreign direct investment doubled over 2012, although a large portion of the increase was due to the acquisition of Grupo Modelo.\n\nMexico stands apart. As of February, Moody’s boosted its rating on Mexico’s government bonds to A3—joining Chile as only the second Latin American country with an “A” rating. The structural reforms Mexico has passed played a role, but so did the ability to pass them. A unified political will to work for what’s in the nation’s best interests is a rare find these days and something about which Washington can only dream.\n\nOther nations, such as Brazil, may be headed in the opposite direction. Brazil’s economy likely shrank in the second half of 2013 and prospects for 2014 are half of what Mexico’s growth is projected to be next year. The Brazilian slowdown follows years of rapid growth and rising prices. Now, there are fears of a Brazilian house price bubble—homes in Sao Paulo are selling at three times 2008 prices. In contrast, Mexico City house prices are up 35 percent.\n\nI am not forecasting a housing bust for the Brazilian economy, mind you. But consumers may have to deleverage, which will detract from growth. The government may have to rein in spending as well. Brazilian government debt has outpaced GDP growth in recent years and currently stands at 57 percent of GDP, nearly twice that of Mexico. Faced with poorer growth prospects and a weakening labor market, Brazilian banks will likely tighten lending after a decade of credit expansion. And at a time that the central bank would normally need to loosen policy to stimulate the economy, it needs tighter policy to ward off inflation.\n\nI am not as concerned about cyclical adjustments as I am about structural impediments to long-run growth in Brazil. During this time of remarkable liquidity and cheap credit, and despite a decade of high commodity prices and booming exports, Brazil failed to advance further market reforms. Mexico, on the other hand, has continued to build on its earlier reforms such as its commitment to free trade through NAFTA and other trade agreements. Mexico has secured the openness of its economy and ensured the global competitiveness of its manufacturing sector. Exports plus imports as a share of Mexico GDP reached 64 percent in 2012 while Brazil’s trade share of GDP was just 21 percent. Mexico is now the No. 2 exporter of auto vehicles to the U.S. after Japan and has been the top exporter of auto parts since 2001.\n\nMexico Reforms and the Texas Shale Oil Boom\n\nMexico in the last year has logged impressive structural change. Your government stands as an example for many other nations, including my own.\n\nA dozen reform bills passed Congress and were signed into law in 2013, five requiring constitutional amendments. To put this feat in perspective, this government has accomplished more in the last year than the three preceding administrations combined.\n\nMexico has revamped labor laws, the education system and its telecommunications system, financial and energy sectors—including a plan to open up its oil and gas sector to private investment. The timing is good. The implementation of these new laws will coincide with a strengthening U.S. economic recovery.\n\nYou know far more about these structural reforms than I do. I cannot pretend to speak with any authority on the detailed economic implications of these reforms, but I do want to offer some perspective from Texas. Last year’s passage of the historic energy reform should, if carefully and deliberately implemented, increase oil and gas production and reverse the nine-year trend of declining output that is currently depressing Mexico exports, industrial production and GDP and adversely impacting government revenues.\n\nThe Eagle Ford shale oil boom in south central Texas exemplifies the regulatory differences between our two regions that the reform aspires to relinquish. The gap is very telling. As activity has accelerated dramatically north of the border, there is no corresponding drilling or production in northern Mexico despite the contiguous geology. And it’s not because Eagle Ford required the deep pockets of the huge energy corporations. Rather, it is largely independent operators who have developed the vast majority of Eagle Ford projects. The result: sharply rising oil production in the Eagle Ford, from nothing four years ago to more than 1.3 million barrels per day currently.\n\nThe shale oil boom in Texas has had far-reaching effects on the state. Texas alone now produces more oil than Mexico, more gas than Canada. While oil and gas industries directly employ only 2.5 percent of Texas workers, the energy sector as a whole accounts for over 10 percent of annual output. Downstream operations—our Gulf Coast refineries—are booming, and gasoline and diesel exports have skyrocketed.\n\nWhile the Texas economy is well diversified and no longer stereotypically dependent on energy, oil and gas provides a not insignificant impetus to the Texas economy and helps differentiate us from the rest of the United States, as does our state government’s approach to pro-business regulation and taxation. To give you an idea of the growth differential with the rest of the nation, Texas employment has grown 2.5 percent per year during the economic recovery, which is about a percentage point faster than the nation. State GDP has averaged 4.2 percent annual average growth since 2009, compared with 2.2 percent in the U.S. Texas exports have increased 79 percent since their low in 2009, compared with 35 percent in the nation.\n\nAll this economic activity is finally spilling over into wages, which are rising in Texas as they remain flat in the rest of the nation. As you can imagine, job opportunities and rising compensation have made Texas the No. 1 destination for interstate moves in the country. Since 2006, Texas has averaged 150,000 newcomers per year who are relocating from other states. This is in addition to international migration, which is still high but has decreased from where it was before the crisis.\n\nThis is what I see for Mexico. Structural reforms—handled judiciously, especially as U.S. economic growth accelerates and Europe recovers—can pay off in spades for the Mexican people, who deserve it many times over. While Mexico has somewhat reduced its dependence on the U.S., 80 percent of exports still go to El Norte. In a strange twist of fate, it may be helpful in the near to medium term to be exporting manufactured goods to a slowly recovering U.S. and Europe rather than maintain the last decade’s shipments of raw materials to China as in the case of Brazil.\n\nMexico Has Emerged\n\nI began my talk tonight by running through the events, institutional backdrop and the thinking behind the Fed’s quantitative easing efforts. I clearly have not been onboard with all the decisions the FOMC has taken during the economic recovery. I fear that we are feeding imbalances similar to those that played a role in the run-up to the financial crisis. With its massive asset purchases, the Fed is distorting financial markets and creating incentives for managers and market players to take increasing risk, some of which may result in tears. And all this is happening in uncharted territory. We have aided creation of massive excess bank reserves without a clear plan for how to drain them when the time comes. And there is the challenge of doing so while keeping inflation expectations stable.\n\nNevertheless, I believe that the FOMC will find practicable ways to normalize the Fed’s balance sheet. I believe that practicable ways will be found to avoid inflationary pressures once the velocity of money returns to precrisis levels. I certainly believe that continuing to pare back on the amount of the Fed’s large-scale asset purchases is a good start and should be continued at a measured pace that leads to their complete elimination as soon as is practicable.\n\nAnd I believe that as the tide of easy money recedes, Mexico stands ready for the next phase. Unlike other emerging market nations, Mexico seized the opportunity to make some tough decisions and is more resilient and globally competitive as a result. Macroeconomic stability, openness to trade and a unified commitment to confront rather than run from market forces indicate that the Mexican economy is no longer an emerging economy; it has emerged. For this man who spent his childhood in Mexico and feels Mexican, this is one of the most gratifying developments of my lifetime. So that’s why I say, ¡Ándale pues, México!\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "February 21, 2014 Austin, Texas\n\nThis is a major theme of my remarks here today. No, not longnecks or other free-flowing libations specifically, but the concept that too much liquidity can be a very dangerous thing. William McChesney Martin, the longest-serving Fed chairman in our institution’s 100-year history, famously said that the Fed’s job is to take away the punchbowl just as the party gets going.\n\n… In the remainder of my time with you here today, I will speak briefly about the operations of the Dallas Fed and of the other 11 Federal Reserve Banks. Then I am going to comment on the Texas economic recovery and speak extemporaneously on recent policy decisions taken by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Finally, I am going to make a brief comment on the depth of the punchbowl of liquidity the Fed has created, the reason I have advocated removing it, and the sobering reality of the fiscal folly of our lawmakers in Washington, D.C.\n\n… For far too long, the greatest obstacle to the nation’s economic prosperity has resided here:\n\n\n\n\n\nA straight-talker with a little salt on his tongue might be tempted to say: “It is fiscal policy that is leading to the Californication of our national economy rather than its Texification.” But I would not say anything so crude, so I am not going to say it. Instead, I’ll invoke an editorial in a recent Financial Times that said it more politely: “Fiscal policy is still not an ally of U.S. growth.”\n\nThis is a picture of the gaping hole in the heart of our nation’s prosperity: If you remove the job-creating machine of Texas from the U.S. economy, the nation has experienced job destruction that has occurred over the past 12 years in the middle-income quartiles.\n\n\n\nI never refer to “classes”; I do not believe status in a democracy should be defined by the hidebound concept of “classes.” But no matter: The most vital organ of our nation’s economy—the middle-income worker—is being eviscerated.\n\nThis is the pathology I worry most about. So I ask: Can my colleagues and I at the Fed cure this with monetary policy? Obviously, businesses cannot create jobs without the means for investing in job-creating expansion, so, yes, monetary policy is necessary to propel job creation.\n\nBut as I have shown this afternoon, the store of bank reserves awaiting discharge into the economy through our banking system is vast, yet it lies fallow. Take a look at this chart of total reserves of depository institutions: They have ballooned from a precrisis level of $43 billion to more than $2.5 trillion.\n\n\n\nHere is the point: There is plenty of money available for businesses to work with. Consider this: In fourth quarter 2007 the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) was $14.7 trillion; at year-end 2013 it was estimated to be $17.1 trillion. Had we continued on the path we were on before the crisis, GDP would currently be roughly $20 trillion in size. That’s a third larger than it was in 2007. Yet the amount of money lying fallow in the banking system is 60 times greater now than it was at year-end 2007. One is hard pressed to argue that there is insufficient money available for businesses to put people back to work.\n\nNow, bear in mind that we at the Fed only control the monetary base (cash plus bank reserves), not the velocity with which money is used. Again, consider this graph:\n\n\n\nOver the past six years, the monetary base has increased 340 percent, 10 times the rate at which the economy would have expanded in nominal terms had we not suffered the recent recession. One is hard pressed to argue that there is much efficacy derived from additional expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet. This is why I’ve been such a strong proponent of dialing back our large-scale asset purchases and will continue advocating that we do so.\n\nIt is my firm belief that the fault in our economy lies not in monetary policy but in a reckless and feckless federal government that simply cannot get its fiscal and regulatory policy geared so as to encourage business to take the copious amount of money we at the Fed have created and put it to work creating jobs and growing our economy. Fiscal policy is not only “not an ally of U.S. growth,” it is its enemy. If the fiscal and regulatory authorities that you elect and put into office to craft taxes, spending and regulations do not focus their efforts on providing incentives for businesses to expand job-creating capital investment rather than bicker with each other for partisan purposes, our economy will continue to fall short and the middle-income worker will continue being victimized, no matter how much money the Fed puts into the system.\n\nI don’t want to ruin your lunch after such pleasant talk of longnecks and liquidity, but if you wish to know who is at fault for hollowing out the welfare of middle-income workers and the American economy, kindly do not look at me or my colleagues at the Fed. When you go home or take a break during today’s conference, look at yourself in the mirror, for you elect our fiscal and regulatory policymakers. Many of you give money to finance the campaigns of candidates from out-of-state: Texas is a treasure trove of campaign finance for both Republicans and Democrats running for national office. We at the Fed are providing more than enough monetary accommodation. It is time for fiscal policymakers to do their job, to ally themselves with us to achieve a fully employed, prosperous America.\n\nIn addition to being proud Longhorns and prosperous Texans, be bold Americans. Only you, as voters, have the power to insist that our lawmakers craft policies that are needed to restore American prosperity. Please do so.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "(With Reference to Peter Boockvar, the Book of Matthew, Sherlock Holmes, ‘The Wolf of Wall Street’ and Denis Healey)\n\nJanuary 14, 2014 Dallas\n\nThank you, George [Jones]. George is a great member of the Dallas Fed board of directors, and I am honored he would take the time to introduce me. Waylon Jennings said of your namesake that “if we could all sound like we wanted to, we’d all sound like George Jones.”[1] I often feel that way about George at our board meetings. He gives a sharp, crisp, spot-on briefing of banking conditions in that deep, beautiful voice of his and I always think: I want to be just like George when I grow up. Again, thank you George for that kind introduction.\n\nDuring the holiday break, I spent a good deal of time trying to organize my thoughts on how I will approach monetary policy going forward. Today, I am going to share some of those thoughts that might be of interest to you as corporate directors.\n\nAt the last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), it was decided that the amount of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) we have been purchasing should each be pared back by $5 billion, so that we would be purchasing a total of $75 billion a month (in addition to reinvesting the proceeds of maturing issues we hold) rather than $85 billion per month. In addition, it was noted that “if incoming information broadly supports the Committee’s expectation(s) … the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings.” And it was made clear that the FOMC expects it will hold the base rate that anchors the yield curve—the federal funds rate, or the rate on overnight money—to its present near-zero rate well past the time when unemployment is reduced to 6½ percent.\n\nI was pleased with the decision to finally begin tapering our bond purchases, though I would have preferred to pull back our purchases by double the announced amount. But the important thing for me is that the committee began the process of slowing down the ballooning of our balance sheet, which at year-end exceeded $4 trillion. And we began—and I use that word deliberately, for we have more to do on this front—to clarify our intentions for managing the overnight money rate.\n\nAs an economist would say, “on net” I was rather pleased with the decision taken at the December FOMC meeting.\n\nUnder the chairmanship of Ben Bernanke, all 12 Federal Reserve Bank presidents, together with the sitting governors of the Federal Reserve Board, have input into the decision-making process. There is a formal vote—regardless of who is the Fed chair—that includes only five of the 12 regional Bank presidents plus the governors, but all of the principals seated at the table participate fully in the discussion of what to do. And yet, either because we will effect a change in the chairmanship starting in February or because at the last meeting we took the step of tapering back by a small amount our massive purchase of Treasuries and MBS, great attention is being placed on the voters for 2014, of which I am one.\n\nTwo comments I recently read have been buzzing around my mind as I think about the many issues that will condition my actions as a voter.\n\nThe first was by Peter Boockvar, who is among the plethora of analysts offering different viewpoints that I regularly read to get a sense of how we are being viewed in the marketplace. Here is a rather pungent quote from a note he sent out on Jan. 2:\n\n“…QE [quantitative easing] puts beer goggles on investors by creating a line of sight where everything looks good…”\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with the term “beer goggles,” the Urban Dictionary defines it as “the effect that alcohol … has in rendering a person who one would ordinarily regard as unattractive as … alluring.” This audience might substitute “wine” or “martini” or “margarita” for “beer” to make it more age-appropriate, but the effect is the same: Things often look better when one is under the influence of free-flowing liquidity. This is one reason why William McChesney Martin, the longest-serving Fed chairman in our institution’s 100-year history, famously said that the Fed’s job is to take away the punchbowl just as the party gets going.[2]\n\nThe other eye catcher for me was a cartoon in the Jan. 6 issue of The New Yorker. Sitting in a room are two businessmen who are apparently conversant with the New Testament’s book of Matthew. One says to the other, “We need either bigger needles or smaller camels.”\n\nToday, I want to muse aloud about whether QE has indeed put beer goggles on investors and whether we, the Fed, can pass the camel of massive quantitative easing through the eye of the needle of normalizing monetary policy without creating havoc.\n\nBoockvar is right. When money available to investors is close to free and is widely available, and there is a presumption that the central bank will keep it that way indefinitely, discount rates applied to assessing the value of future cash flows shift downward, making for lower hurdle rates for valuations. A bull market for stocks and other claims on tradable companies ensues; the financial world looks rather comely.\n\nMarket operators donning beer goggles and even some sober economists consider analysts like Boockvar party poopers. But I have found myself making arguments similar to his and to those of other skeptics at recent FOMC meetings, pointing to some developments that signal we have made for an intoxicating brew as we have continued pouring liquidity down the economy’s throat.\n\nAmong them:\n\nAnd then there are the knock-on effects of all of the above. Market operators are once again spending money freely outside of their day jobs. An example: For almost 40 years, I have spent a not insignificant portion of my savings collecting rare, first-edition books. Like any patient investor in any market, I have learned through several market cycles that you buy when nobody wants something and sell when everyone clamors for more. During the financial debacle of 2007–09, I was able to buy for a song volumes I have long coveted (including a mint-condition first printing from 1841 of Mackay’s Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions, which every one of you should read and re-read, certainly if you are contemplating seeing the movie The Wolf of Wall Street). Today, I could not afford them. First editions, like paintings, sculptures, fine wines, Bugattis and homes in Highland Park or River Oaks, have become the by-product of what I am sure Bill Martin would consider a party well underway.\n\nI want to make clear that I am not among those who think we are presently in a “bubble” mode for stocks or bonds or most other assets. But this much I know: Just as Martin knew by virtue of his background as a noneconomist who had hands-on Wall Street experience, markets for anything tradable overshoot and one must be prepared for adjustments that bring markets back to normal valuations.\n\nThis need not threaten the real economy. The “slow correction” of 1962 comes to mind as an example: A stock market correction took place, and yet the economy continued to fare well.\n\nHere is the point as to the market’s beer goggles. Were a stock market correction to ensue while I have the vote, I would not flinch from supporting continued reductions in the size of our asset purchases as long as the real economy is growing, cyclical unemployment is declining and demand-driven deflation remains a small tail risk; I would vote for continued reductions in our asset purchases, with an eye toward eliminating them entirely at the earliest practicable date.\n\nLet’s turn to the camel, by which I mean the size of the Fed’s balance sheet.\n\nA little history provides some perspective. We began to grow our balance sheet as we approached year-end 2008. On Sept. 10, 2008, the amount of Reserve Bank credit outstanding was $867 billion. On Nov. 25, 2008, we announced a program to purchase $100 billion of securities issued by the housing-related government-sponsored enterprises, together with our intent to purchase up to $500 billion in MBS in order to goose the housing market. I supported these initiatives, recognizing that the economy was in the throes of a financial panic.\n\nFollowing our December 2008 meeting, the FOMC announced that it had cut the target range for the fed funds rate to 0-to-1/4 of 1 percent, and being thus “zero bound,” we floated the idea of purchasing longer-term Treasuries in order to provide further monetary accommodation (when we buy Treasuries or MBS and agency debt, we put money into the financial system, substituting for further interest rate cuts). On March 18, 2009, we announced additional purchases of up to $750 billion of agency MBS and up to $100 billion of agency debt, plus purchases of up to $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities over six months. That day, our balance sheet was marked at $2 trillion.\n\nThere are some details that impacted our balance sheet, which I have omitted so as not to bore you or entangle you in the entrails of central bank operations: For example, liquidity swaps with other central banks declined from a peak occasioned by the financial crisis of $583 billion the week ended Dec. 10, 2008, to $330 billion the following March, thus somewhat mitigating the growth of our balance sheet over that period.[3]\n\nFrom my perch, I considered a balance sheet of $2-plus trillion and a base lending rate of 0-to-1/4 of 1 percent more than sufficient to stimulate not just the housing market but the stock market, too, thus placing us on the path of what economists refer to as “the wealth effect”—the working assumption that rising prices for homes, stocks and bonds floats the income boat of all Americans.\n\nI basically said so publicly on March 26, 2009, in a speech to the RISE Forum, an annual student investment conference. At the time, the S&P 500 was priced at 814, the Nasdaq at 1,529 and the Dow at 7,750. The mindset of investors at that moment was summarized at an earlier FOMC meeting by one of my most esteemed colleagues at the Fed, who quipped that in looking at the balance sheets of most financial institutions, “nothing on the right is right and nothing on the left is left.” As I looked at the faces of the students gathered in that vast auditorium, I could see in their eyes a reflection of the gloom and doom of the time.\n\nHere is what I told these young investors that dark morning: “… the current economic and financial predicament represents a potential gold mine rather than a minefield. Historically, great investors have made their money by climbing a wall of worry rather than letting a woeful consensus cow them. … Your job as investors is … to ferret out from the general-market malaise good financial and business operators whose franchises and prospects are overdiscounted at current prices. Were I you … I would be licking my chops at the opportunities that always abound in times of adversity. … There are a lot of dollar bills that can be found in the debris of the current markets that can be picked up for nickels and dimes.”\n\nOf course, I would not mention this today had I been wrong! Currently, the right hand side of the balance sheet of most any well-managed market-traded business is chock-full of restructured, cheap debt and leaner common stock, while the left side is bulging with surplus cash. The S&P closed yesterday at 1,819, the Nasdaq at 4,113 and the Dow at 16,258—a plateau over two times above the valley into which they had descended in 2009.\n\nAnd, again, there are the signs of conspicuous consumption I mentioned earlier that reflect a fully robust stock market. If there is indeed a wealth effect that spreads from clever market operators to the working people of America, a $2 trillion balance sheet might well have been sufficient to have performed the trick.\n\nThe FOMC is a committee, however, and the majority of my colleagues have disagreed with me on this point. We have since doubled our balance sheet to $4 trillion. This has resulted not only in saltatory[4] housing, bond and stock markets, but a real economy that is on the mend, with cyclical unemployment declining and inflation thus far held at bay.\n\nHere is the rub. We have accomplished the last $2 trillion of balance-sheet expansion by purchasing unprecedented amounts of longer-maturity assets: As of Jan. 8, 2014, 75 percent of Federal Reserve-held loans and securities had remaining maturities in excess of five years.\n\nThe brow begins to furrow. To be sure, Treasury and MBS markets are liquid markets. But the old market operator in me is conscious that we hold nearly 40 percent of outstanding eligible MBS and of Treasuries with more than five years to maturity. Selling that concentrated an amount of even the most presumably liquid assets would be a heck of lot more complicated than accumulating it.\n\nCurrently, this is not an issue. But as the economy grows, the massive amount of money sitting on the sidelines will be activated; the “velocity” of money will accelerate. If it does so too quickly, we might create inflation or financial market instability or both.\n\nThe 12 Federal Reserve Banks house the excess reserves of the depository institutions of America: If loan demand fails to grow at the same rate as banks accumulate reserves due to our hyperaccommodative monetary policy, the resultant excess reserves are deposited with us at a rate of return of 25 basis points (1/4 of 1 percent per annum).\n\nHere is some math confronting policymakers: Excess reserves are currently 65 percent of the monetary base and rising. The only other time excess reserves as a percentage of the base have come anywhere close to this level was at the close of the 1930s, when the ratio hit 41 percent. We are in uncharted territory.\n\nTo prevent excess reserves from fueling a too-rapid expansion of bank lending in an expanding economy, the Fed will need to either drain reserves on a large scale by selling longer-term assets at a loss or provide inducements to banks to keep reserves idle, by offering interest on excess reserves at a rate competitive with what banks might earn on loans to businesses and consumers. Or we might employ more widely new techniques we are currently testing, such as “reverse repos,” complex transactions in which we, in effect, borrow cash overnight from market operators while posting securities as collateral.\n\nSuch inducements to control the velocity of the monetary base might expose the Fed to intense scrutiny and criticism. The big banks that park the lion’s share of excess reserves with us are hardly the darlings of public sentiment. Raising interest payments to them while scaling back our remittances to the Treasury might raise a few congressional eyebrows. And as to our repo operations, we have never implemented them on anywhere near the scale envisioned.\n\nOf greatest concern to me is that the risk of scrutiny and criticism might hinder policymakers from acting quickly enough to remove or dampen the dry inflationary tinder that is inherent in the massive, but currently fallow, monetary base.\n\nIn the parlance of central banking, the “exit” challenge we now face is somewhat daunting: How do we pass a camel fattened by trillions of dollars of longer-term, less-liquid purchases through the eye of the needle of getting back to a “normalized” balance sheet so as to keep inflation under wraps and yet provide the right amount of monetary impetus for the economy to keep growing and expanding?\n\nI have great faith in the integrity and brainpower of my fellow policymakers. I am confident that the 19 earnest women and men that make up the FOMC will do their level best under Chairwoman Janet Yellen’s leadership to accomplish a smooth exit that keeps prices stable and the economy in a job-creating mode. But my confidence will be bolstered if my colleagues adopt the First Law of Holes espoused in the late ’70s by then-British Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey: “If you find yourself in a hole, stop digging.”\n\nThe housing market is well along in repair;[5] the economy is expanding; cyclical unemployment is declining. To be sure, there will be individual data points that appear to challenge confidence, like the just-released employment report for December. But I believe the odds favor continued economic progress. And I believe that continuing large-scale asset purchases risks placing us in an untenable position, both from the standpoint of unreasonably inflating the stock, bond and other tradable asset markets and from the perspective of complicating the future conduct of monetary policy.\n\nThe eye of the needle of pulling off a clean exit is narrow; the camel is already too fat. As soon as feasible, we should change tack. We should stop digging. I plan to cast my votes at FOMC meetings accordingly.\n\nThank you.\n\nNotes\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "December 19, 2013 Dallas, Texas\n\nThank you, Margaret [Keliher].\n\nToday I am going to talk about one subject only: the Texas economy. As you know, just yesterday I was in Washington for the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). At the end of the meeting, a statement was issued as to what that committee consisting of the 12 Federal Reserve Bank presidents and six members of the Fed’s Board of Governors decided regarding the course of monetary policy; Chairman Bernanke followed with a press conference. In keeping with our tradition, this morning I will refrain from commenting on the decisions made. We are under a self-imposed “communication blackout” regarding our views about macroeconomic developments or monetary policy issues until after midnight tonight. So if you wish, call me at home at 12:01 tomorrow morning and … incur the eternal wrath of my wife, Nancy!\n\nSome of you have undoubtedly heard Gen. Philip Sheridan’s notable expression, “If I owned Texas and hell, I would rent out Texas and live in hell.” Although he reportedly recanted his statement, even a man as renowned for his cruelty as Gen. Sheridan would certainly have changed his opinion if he were around today. It wouldn’t have taken him long after crossing the river Styx to realize that rather than renting out Texas he would have been better off purchasing every bit of it. His return on investment would have been astronomical. My hunch is that Sheridan would want to live in Texas with you and me and would seek to rent out hell—perhaps to the U.S. Congress, though it would have to be free of charge given their fiscal predicament!\n\nThe Success of the Lone Star State\n\nHere’s why I believe Texas is attractive to even the Gen. Sheridans of the world. The state’s total output—the equivalent of gross domestic product—is approximately $1.4 trillion, in the neighborhood of countries like Australia and Spain. We produce more oil than Venezuela or Norway and more natural gas than Canada or all 28 countries of the European Union combined. And we produce jobs like gee-whiz. A job is the source of income and the root of security and wealth for a productive people. Without income a person cannot consume and invest, engaging the engines of economic growth. Most importantly, a job is the route to dignity as we have historically defined it in America.\n\nJobs, Jobs, Jobs\n\nFor the past 23 years, Texas has outpaced the country in job creation by a factor of more than 2-to-1. Here is a slide that shows the percentage increase in jobs created by several large states and for the U.S. as a whole since 1990:\n\n\n\nNote the dotted black line drawn from the base of 100 in 1990. For the residents of the home of Motown or the Empire State or the Land of Lincoln, this graph does not present a happy picture. Since 1990, total employment growth in Michigan has been 5 percent, a compound annual growth rate of 0.17 percent, a pace that is one-twelfth that of Texas over the same period. New York and Illinois have not fared much better.\n\nIf you zoom in on the period since the onset of the financial crisis, you can see an even greater disparity in employment growth trends for Texas vis-à-vis the other large U.S. states:\n\n\n\nIn terms of jobs, Texas was one of the last states to lose ground during the recession and then led the pack in punching through employment levels that prevailed at the end of 2007. Fortunately, all of the selected states shown in the chart appear to be recovering, albeit rather slowly, from licks taken during the crisis. However, even the Empire State can’t compare, despite its devotees of the perspective captured by Saul Steinberg’s iconic 1976 cover of New Yorker, “View of the World from Ninth Avenue,” depicting everything west of the Hudson River as a vast wasteland. Compared to the view in 1976, Texas stands tall above all the rest. Why is that?\n\nWhy Are Things Bigger (or Better) in Texas?\n\nMy friends in New York and other foreign places often criticize the relative success of the Lone Star State. They like to argue that Texas may well be creating more employment, but it is just low-wage jobs—the kind nobody wants. Well, truth be told, while low-wage jobs grow faster in Texas than elsewhere, so do all other jobs. As this next slide makes very clear, Texas also leads the rest of the nation in creating middle-income and high-wage jobs:\n\n\n\nThe U.S. ex-Texas has seen net job destruction for middle wage earners over the past decade. Meanwhile, Texas has experienced robust job creation for these important middle-income workers. Texas has not been immune to growing income inequality or the larger issue of labor market polarization, but the notion that Texas only creates minimum wage jobs is a myth.\n\nDiversification Helps\n\nAnother Texas-growth-miracle fable I enjoy debunking goes like this: All of our state’s job and wealth creation comes from the booming energy industry. At the Dallas Fed, we account for the influence of oil and gas on our state’s welfare: Oil and gas extraction and mining directly employ 2.5 percent of our workforce—two-point-five percent. And the energy sector’s total contribution to our state’s total output is roughly 11 percent. So, yes, it is true: We have a strong energy sector in Texas. We are the No. 1 producer of oil and gas in the nation. I already mentioned that we produce more oil than Venezuela and more natural gas than Canada.\n\nOn net, high energy prices do, indeed, benefit Texans. But look at this slide of the number and diversity of jobs created by sector thus far in 2013. The vertical axis is the number of jobs created in thousands; the horizontal axis denotes the various job categories and, in parentheses, the share of total jobs represented by each category:\n\n\n\nOil and gas and mining and their support services accounted for 17,600 jobs, or 8 percent, of the 221,300 positions created in Texas in January through October of this year. Of course, the oil and gas sector has large multipliers, so the overall economic impact is greater than just these 17,600 jobs. For example, a University of Texas at San Antonio study estimates that the Eagle Ford Shale generated over $61 billion in economic impact and supported 116,000 jobs in 2012. And this is just one of four important oil and natural gas producing regions in the Eleventh Federal Reserve District that the shale boom has significantly affected. In 2012, the Permian Basin, Barnett, Haynesville and Eagle Ford accounted for 25 percent of U.S. oil supply and 28 percent of U.S. natural gas supply.[1]\n\nObviously, the oil patch has been a boon to Texas growth. But in 2013, trade, transportation and utilities accounted for 45,300 jobs; leisure and hospitality, 43,300; professional and business services, 38,200; educational and health services, 29,700; and construction, 19,100. As this chart shows, oil and gas is but the sixth strongest source of job creation. Ours is a diversified economy, creating jobs across the spectrum and in all income categories.\n\nBlessed to Be in Texas\n\nHere are some other facts and figures that help round out the economic picture of our state.\n\nIn the housing sector, Texas largely avoided the housing boom and bust that struck most of the nation. We did not experience a housing bubble:\n\n\n\nNor did we suffer a housing bust:\n\n\n\nIt helped that a 1997 amendment to the Texas Constitution allowed home equity loans and cash-out refinancing for the first time in the state’s history, but limited the amount of total debt (new loan plus the first mortgage) to no more than 80 percent of a home’s value. Combined with other factors such as ample land availability and fewer development and zoning restrictions, Texas housing stock increased during the last decade’s national boom without the rapidly rising home prices experienced elsewhere. With borrowing under control and house prices relatively stable, the state escaped the brunt of the housing sector fallout and experienced relatively few underwater mortgages:\n\n\n\nAs to the sector we at the Dallas Fed supervise directly, fewer Texas banks have suffered net losses than in the rest of the nation:\n\n\n\n¡Viva México!\n\nLast, Texas is blessed to have a great neighbor to the immediate south. The Mexican economy has a significant impact on our state; a fortunate development for us, given that its economy is being transformed to a greater degree than most people here in El Norte realize. Admittedly, Mexico hit a rough patch in the first half of this year, but the Dallas Fed sees this as largely due to transitory factors.\n\nIt is surprising to many that Mexico recovered more quickly from the Great Recession than the United States. Inflation in Mexico has reached record lows after trending down for two decades following important reforms: central bank independence in 1994 and adoption of inflation targeting in 2001. Relatively low inflation, together with a stable peso, has protected the purchasing power of the Mexican consumer and allowed income and savings to grow. Further, after its horrific banking crisis in 1994–95 and an ensuing decade of stagnant lending, Mexico’s banking industry is well capitalized and growing again, and financial access, while still limited, is expanding quickly.\n\nMexico has also remained a staunch proponent of free trade. Exports and imports now make up 62 percent of Mexican economic output versus 17.5 percent as recently as 1980. Since Mexico joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (the forerunner of the World Trade Organization) in 1986 and ratified the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994, it has forged 12 trade pacts with 44 nations.\n\nOn the fiscal front, Mexico’s 2012 budget deficit was a respectable 2.6 percent of GDP, which compares with 7 percent here. For all their differences, Mexican lawmakers have a commitment to fiscal discipline. They adopted a balanced-budget rule in 2006 and have chosen to abide by it rather than take the “kick-the-can-down-the-road” approach.\n\nWith all the progress in the macroeconomy, banking, finance and trade, structural reforms are what Mexico now needs to catapult to a leadership role among emerging-market economies. President Peña Nieto appears to be doing just that, pushing forward with structural modernization. Mexico might best be described, in economic parlance, as an “emerged country.”\n\nExports, Exports, Exports\n\nTexas benefits from a stronger Mexico in many ways, including on the export front. Here is a picture of the export growth from our trade relationships with our increasingly successful southern neighbor, as well as our other major trading partners:\n\n\n\nOne noticeable takeaway from this Texas export chart is the difference in the trajectory of the red and blue lines. Since the beginning of 2009, Texas exports have grown more than 70 percent while the nation’s exports, sans Texas, have increased at half that pace and are only now back to prerecession levels.\n\nA Great Place for Immigrants\n\nOf course, not every facet of the Texas economy is as supportive of the economic narrative expressed by the previous charts. Texas lags most other states in social services. We are the antithesis of the welfare state. And yet, if you believe people vote with their feet and put their money where their mouth is, the balance Texas has struck between job creation and social services seems appropriate enough to attract the diaspora from the other mega-states. We draw massive inflows of business investment, and we attract significant numbers of newcomers. In recent years, Texas has consistently welcomed more migrants—foreign and domestic—than any other state.[2]\n\nDomestic migration is a brain and human-resource gain for Texas and corresponding drain from sending states. Texas transplants have higher levels of education than native Texans and fill key niches in the high-skilled labor force. Since 2004, California has been the largest sending state by far—nearly one-quarter of net domestic migration to Texas between 2006 and 2012 came from California. In fact, so many Californians have been moving to Texas in recent years that the price of a one-way, 26-foot U-Haul rental truck from San Francisco to San Antonio is over twice the price for the same truck traveling in the opposite direction.\n\n\n\nMany of the high-skilled migrants coming to our state are drawn to the high-tech, health care, professional and business services, and energy sectors in the fast-growing “Texas Triangle” cities—Austin, Houston and Dallas–Fort Worth. Internal Revenue Service tax records suggest that over 80 percent of taxpayers who moved into Texas during 2000–10 flowed into these three metropolitan areas, which also experienced significant inflows from other parts of Texas.\n\nThus, it comes as no surprise that these major metros have been huge contributors to the state’s strong overall employment growth. Year-to-date through October, Dallas–Fort Worth has added 87,400 jobs. The DFW metro area has maintained a year-over-year annual growth rate greater than 2 percent since January 2011 (34 months and counting). Due south, down Interstate 45, there’s a new Houstonian every four minutes, given current in-migration and net population growth trends. Houstonians are also on a homebuying tear; this year the pace has averaged one home sale every six minutes. In summary, Texas is attracting bright minds and eager workers from across the nation, and we are all better off for it.\n\nAnd You Can’t Fault the Fed\n\nThere are many reasons that Texas is outpacing the nation in terms of economic growth. But one thing I can tell you with absolute certainty is that the underperformance of other large states, like California, relative to Texas has nothing to do with Federal Reserve policy. After all, Texas is subject to the same monetary policy as California and the other states of the union. Texans pay similar interest rates on mortgages and on commercial and industrial and consumer loans. We operate under the same federal regulatory regime governing banks and financial institutions and compete in the same financial markets as the rest of the nation.\n\nSo what gives? If my charts did not impress you, then perhaps the economic miracle of Texas can be best explained by John Steinbeck’s account of his travels across America with his poodle, Charley, in 1960:\n\nSteinbeck nailed it. Above all, Texas is a state of mind where people are ready to work and get things done for the betterment of their families, communities, cities and beyond. We should be proud, indeed, to call the Lone Star State our home.[4]\n\nI usually end my speeches by saying “In the great tradition of central bankers, I would now be happy to avoid answering your questions.” But given that monetary policy is off limits this morning, and I am never shy on Texas brag, I’d be glad to answer any and all of the questions you might have.\n\nThank you.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "December 9, 2013 Chicago\n\nThank you, Urban (Lehner).\n\nI lived in Tokyo for much of 1990, when Urban was bureau chief of the Wall Street Journal there. He taught me Japan, steering me away from then-stereotypical views harbored by American analysts and guiding me through a deep dive into Japanese literature and history that later served me well when I was deputy U.S. trade representative and negotiated with the Japanese. Only Urban Lehner could have authored a masterpiece like “Let’s Talk Turkey About Japanese Turkeys and Other Tales….”[1] His deep understanding of the uniqueness of Japan is impressive, as is his work the past decade as a discerning editor of DTN/The Progressive Farmer. Thank you, Urban, for your friendship and insights.\n\nIn Praise of Norman Borlaug\n\nYou might wonder why I so readily accepted Urban’s invitation to speak to this great group of farm and agriculture leaders on a cold December day. Typically, I and my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) defer to my respected colleague, Esther George, the president of the Kansas City Fed, and her able staff for commentary on developments in agriculture. I promise the rapidity of my acceptance of Urban’s invitation to speak to you has little to do with my eagerness to see the Dallas Cowboys manhandle the Bears tonight at Soldier Field. But my link to you and to agriculture actually does come from sports: from Little League baseball rather than NFL football.\n\nAs Urban mentioned, I grew up in Mexico City. I played Little League there for the Leones (the Lions). My coach was Norman Borlaug. I doubt there is a person in this room who doesn’t know and revere that name. Back in 1970, when the Nobel committee awarded the Peace Prize based on proven success and true merit, I believe their citation provided the best summary of Norman Borlaug’s contribution to mankind: “More than any other single person of this age,” the Nobel committee declared, “he has helped provide bread for a hungry world” with his development of genetically unique strains of “semi-dwarf” wheat.[2] I don’t think one can overstate what Norman Borlaug’s “green revolution” accomplished: He saved billions of people from starvation by applying science to agriculture.\n\nBorlaug developed those wheat strains working in Mexico with a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation. When he wasn’t in the lab or out in the field, or letting his son Billy and me ride with him on his tractor, he coached me in Mexico City’s Little League.\n\nI stayed in close touch over the years with the Borlaugs and often spoke of my coach at our family dinner table. One year, he came to my daughter Alison’s school, Hockaday in Dallas, to speak at a lower-school assembly. The headmistress began by asking if any of the girls knew why Mr. Borlaug received the Nobel Peace Prize. Alison’s hand shot up. She thought it was “for coaching Little League baseball.”\n\nNorman Borlaug died on Sept. 12, 2009. That very day, another of our little cadre of gringos who grew up in Mexico City, Professor Bill Raun of Oklahoma State University, was visiting his idol and showing him the latest version of a handheld device he had developed called the GreenSeeker. The sensor could be used by any farmer in the field to easily determine how much fertilizer and nitrogen to properly apply.[3] Borlaug approved. In fact, the very last words he uttered before passing away were “Take it to the farmer.”\n\nI am honored that you have given me the chance to “take it to the farmer” by speaking here today.\n\nIn Ag, the Cure for High Prices Is … High Prices\n\nBefore joining the Fed, as mentioned by Urban, I spent four years as deputy U.S. trade representative and countless hours trying to settle vexing ag trade disputes not only with the Japanese but with many other countries. So if you permit me to nostalgically stray from my current role as a central banker, I am going to take the liberty of speaking briefly to recent developments in agriculture before providing my personal perspective on the outlook for the economy and monetary policy.\n\nWe are seeing a significant and sustained correction in the price of wheat and corn. I expect soybeans to follow, as well as the sources of animal protein created from these basic plant-food stocks. We have had bumper crops of wheat and corn and huge plantings of soy. When I say “we,” I am referring not just to the United States but to what I call the globalized breadbasket, which consists of the United States, the Black Sea area, Canada, Australia, Latin America and other growing areas that have responded with prodigious output to high prices that prevailed for a sustained period. These are elevated prices that have popularly been attributed to surging demand from China and others that have moved up the protein ladder as they have achieved greater prosperity in the post-Cold War, post-Mao Zedong world.\n\nFrom an economic standpoint, there are lessons to be learned here. First, the farmer’s rule of thumb on price movements still obtains: The cure for high prices is high prices. As night follows day, farmers, aided today by successive iterations of Norman Borlaug’s innovations and new, easy-to-use technological achievements like Bill Raun’s, will respond to demand-pull inflation in crop prices with greater plantings and harvests, often to the point of overshooting. This is no doubt a phenomenon you will be pursuing at this summit on “Tactics to Tame Volatility.”\n\nAs you consider potential tactics, I hope you will keep the following in mind:\n\nI would add a “c,” a third point for you to bear in mind: You had all better use to the good this unusual period in economic history of proactively accommodative monetary policy by the Federal Reserve and other major central banks. The FOMC has made money the cheapest and most widely available of any time in American history. Interest rates dipped to their lowest level in 237 years; bond and stock markets rallied to historic highs in both nominal and real terms; bankers and investors are flush with liquidity; for anybody who is creditworthy, money is über-abundant. This will not last forever. One would be foolish not to exploit it now.\n\nThe Course of Monetary Policy\n\nIn discussing the course of monetary policy, I can only speak to my own views.\n\nAs Urban mentioned, I will be a voter on the FOMC next year. I am happy to lay out for you my perspective. It is this: In my view, the Federal Reserve has supplied more than sufficient liquidity to fuel economic recovery above and beyond a reduction of unemployment from its current level of 7 percent. As I just said, money is cheap and liquidity is abundant. Indeed, it is coursing over the gunwales of the ship of our economy, placing us at risk of becoming submerged in financial shenanigans rather than in conducting business based on fundamentals.\n\nMonetary Policy Rendered Flaccid\n\nTo be sure, the job creators in our economy—private companies—have used this period of accommodative monetary policy to clean up the liability side of their balance sheets and fine-tune their bottom lines by buying shares and increasing dividends. They have also continued achieving productivity enhancement and relentless reduction in SG&A (selling, general and administrative expenses). Running tight ships, they are now poised to hire as they become more confident about nonmonetary matters that remain unresolved.\n\nI used to say that the United States was the best-looking horse in the global glue factory. Now, I firmly believe we are the most fit stallion or filly on the global racetrack: Our companies are the most financially prepared and most productively operated they have been at any time during the nearly four decades since I graduated from business school. What is holding them back is not the cost or the availability of credit and finance. What is holding them back is fiscal and regulatory policy that is, at best, uncertain, and at worst, counterproductive.\n\nAgainst that background, I believe that the current program of purchasing $85 billion per month in U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities comes at a cost that far exceeds its purported benefits. Presently, there is no private or public company that I know of, including many CCC-rated credits, that does not now have access to sufficient, cheap capital. There is no private or public company I know of that considers monetary policy to be deficient. Instead, to a company, every CEO I talk to feels that uncertainty derived from fiscal policy and regulatory interference is the key government-induced deterrent to more robust economic growth and profitability.\n\nThe FOMC has helped enable a sharp turn in the housing market and roaring stock and bond markets. I would argue that the former benefited the middle-income quartiles, while the latter has primarily benefited the rich and the quick. Though the recent numbers are encouraging, easy money has failed to encourage the robust payroll expansion that is the basis for the sustained consumer demand on which our economy depends. It cannot do so in and of itself. Without fiscal policy that incentivizes rather than discourages U.S. capex (capital expenditure), this accommodative monetary policy aimed at reducing unemployment (especially structural unemployment) or improving the quality of jobs is rendered flaccid and less than optimally effective. And as to the housing markets, prices are now appreciating to levels that may be hampering affordability in many markets.\n\nWhat About Inflation?\n\nAs to the issue of inflation, the run rate for personal consumption expenditure (PCE) prices in the third quarter was 2 percent, according to recently revised data. The Dallas Fed computes a Trimmed Mean analysis of the PCE, which we feel provides a more accurate view of inflationary developments. The 12-month run rate for the Trimmed Mean PCE has been steady at 1.3 percent for the past seven months.\n\nAs measured by surveys and financial market indicators, expected inflation five or more years out is anchored firmly at levels consistent with the 2 percent rate that modern central bankers now cotton to as appropriate. These surveys and indicators also show expected price increases over 2014 only modestly below 2 percent.\n\nAgainst this background, I am not of the school of thought that monetary policy need continue to be hyperaccommodative or be made even more so in order to bring medium-term inflation expectations closer to target. I certainly don’t see any justification for seeking to raise medium-term expectations above 2 percent as an inducement for businesses to pour on capex and expand payrolls or for policy to act as an incentive for consumers to go out and spend more money now rather than later. To me, this would just undermine the slowly improving confidence we have begun to see.\n\nEspecially given that we have a surfeit of excess liquidity sloshing about in the system, the idea of ramping up inflation expectations from their current tame levels strikes me as short-sighted and even reckless. We already have enough kindling for potential long-term inflation, which will sorely test our capacity to manage policy going forward. I do not wish to add further wood to that pile.\n\nIt Is Time to Taper\n\nIn my view, we at the Fed should begin tapering back our bond purchases at the earliest opportunity. To enable the markets to digest this change of course with minimal disruption, we should do so within the context of a clearly articulated, well-defined calendar for reducing purchases on a steady path to zero. We should make clear that, barring some serious economic crisis, we will stay the course of reduction rather than give an imprecise nod as we did after the May and June meetings that led markets to believe the program might end as unemployment reached 7 percent.\n\nOnly then can we at the Fed return to focusing on management of the overnight rate that anchors the yield curve. To be sure, we may wish to keep overnight rates low for a prolonged period, depending on economic developments. But we need to return to conducting monetary policy that is more in keeping with the normal role of a central bank. We need to break away from trying to manipulate term premia and stop prolonging the distortions that accrue from our massive long-term bond purchases and the risks we incur in building an ever-expanding balance sheet that is now approaching $4 trillion.\n\nBecoming Dentists Once Again\n\nI consider this strategy desirable on its own merit: I would feel more comfortable were we to remove ourselves as soon as possible from interfering with the normal price-setting functioning of financial markets. And I consider it desirable from the standpoint of protecting our limited franchise. As Chairman (Ben) Bernanke has pointed out politely, and I have argued less diplomatically, good monetary policy is necessary—but certainly not sufficient—to return the nation to full employment. Acting as though we can go it alone only builds expectations that far exceed our capacity. And it could lead us to believe that we have a greater capacity to control economic outcomes than we actually have.\n\nIf I may paraphrase a sainted figure for many of my colleagues, John Maynard Keynes: If the members of the FOMC could manage to get themselves to once again be thought of as humble, competent people on the level of dentists, that would be splendid.[4] I would argue that the time to reassume a more humble central banker persona is upon us.\n\nThat, Urban, is my take on monetary policy in a nutshell. Now, in the best tradition of central banking—and dentistry! —I would be happy to avoid answering any questions you or your colleagues might have.\n\nThank you.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "November 4, 2013 Sydney, Australia\n\nThank you, Stephen [Halmarick].\n\nI am thrilled to be back in Sydney. Earlier this morning, I visited Reserve Bank Governor Stevens and his staff and provided a read on the U.S. economy and monetary policy as of last week’s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nI thought I would do the same for you this afternoon. I would then be happy, in the best tradition of central banking, to avoid answering any questions you have.\n\nTo Begin, a Biographical Note\n\nAs was mentioned by Stephen, I am indeed half Aussie. My father, Leslie Fisher, was a Queenslander. In 1910, at the age of five years and two months, he was arrested for begging on the streets in Maryborough and sentenced in the court there to seven years in the Westbrook Reformatory.[1]\n\nAccording to an article earlier this year in Toowoomba’s daily, The Chronicle, Westbrook was “the most feared reformatory in Australia.” The guards there meted out “vicious beatings.”[2] Thankfully, my father’s sentence was commuted after one month; “the little boy … is of tender years and not a fit subject,” wrote the Police Magistrate. My father was released to an orphanage, then shuttled among a series of harsh foster homes before making his way back to the streets and a remarkable career that took him from Toowoomba to Brisbane to South Africa, Mexico, China and the United States and, ultimately, to … the great republic of Texas!\n\nMy dad lived to the ripe old age of 90. He was a tough old bird. And Aussie to the bone. For most of his life, he smoked three packs of cigarettes a day and drank a great deal of Scotch. He admitted to this one evening and a friend said, “Hold on. My father was a smoker and also drank a lot of Scotch. But he died at 60. What gives?” To which my father replied, “Well, he just didn’t do it long enough.”[3]\n\nThe Westbrook prison is no more; indeed, the property on which it stood was sold in May of this year. But the courthouse in Maryborough where my father was sentenced still stands. On Wednesday, I will visit it to remind myself of where I come from. And to thank my lucky stars that I am the son of a gutsy Australian who managed in one generation to secure his family’s rise from homeless to Harvard, from begging for food to riches, from being a ward of the state to becoming a principal in the policymaking of the most important central bank in the world.\n\nSo Stephen, when I say “I am thrilled” to be here, I mean it. I thank you for having me, the son of the humblest of Queenslanders, address such a distinguished audience here in Sydney.\n\nThe Fed in Context\n\nAustralia was in the grips of a great economic contraction when my father roamed the streets of Maryborough. The economic depression here reverberated from a lengthy economic downturn in the United States that crystalized in the Panic of 1907—the so-called “Rich Man’s Panic” beginning in May of that year. It saw the failure of the Knickerbocker Trust Co., the third-largest bank in New York, and many other banks of deposit in the U.S. as well as then-notable financial institutions in places as far away as Egypt, Japan, Hamburg, Chile and here, Down Under.[4]\n\nEarly in 1907, Jacob Schiff of Kuhn Loeb & Co. gave a speech to the New York Chamber of Commerce. He warned that “unless we have a central bank with adequate control of credit resources, [the United States] will undergo the most severe and far-reaching money panic in history.”[5] His words were prescient.\n\nAt the time, we did not have a central bank in the United States; we had not had one for over seven decades. The United States had two central banks before 1907: the First Bank of the United States lasted 20 years before its charter expired in 1811 and was not renewed by Congress; the Second Bank of the United States also lasted 20 years before being closed by President Andrew Jackson in 1836.\n\nIn 1907, the American financial system was, for all practical purposes, under the control of a handful of financiers. Foremost among them was J.P. Morgan. Mr. Morgan was capable of maneuvering through the ups and downs of an economy and financial system without a central bank and become ever richer. The majority of American businesses and bankers could not and were waylaid by recession and financial panic. For all practical purposes, J.P. Morgan was the closest thing to a lender of last resort but was a profiteer, and thus a very poor substitute for a central bank that Jacob Schiff so rightly said we needed.\n\nThe Panic of 1907 led to the creation by Congress of the National Monetary Commission and, to make a long story short, that commission, led by Sen. Nelson Aldrich of Rhode Island, laid the groundwork for President Woodrow Wilson and the Congress to create the Federal Reserve System in 1913 and establish the system’s 12 Federal Reserve Banks in 1914.\n\nThe Fed is uniquely American in structure. It is disaggregated, with the working business of the central bank distributed across the land through 12 Federal Reserve districts. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and its branches in Houston, San Antonio and El Paso conduct the Fed’s business and represent the perspectives of 27 million people and almost $1.5 trillion in annual output from Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico—roughly the equivalent of the population and output of Australia.\n\nThe president of the United States appoints and the U.S. Senate confirms the chairman and the six other governors of the Fed who reside in Washington. The presidents who operate the business of our central bank through the dozen Federal Reserve Banks spread across the nation are not federal employees. They work under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Board, but serve at the pleasure of and answer to their own boards of directors that consist of nine private citizens from their individual Reserve Bank districts. The 12 Federal Reserve Bank presidents represent the heartland of the country, “Main Street” as we say in the States. Unlike the Federal Reserve governors, we do not suffer in having to live in the politically charged atmosphere of Washington, D.C.; we operate banker’s banks rather than maneuvering around the lobbyists and rent seekers that leech off the political center of our nation.\n\nTo make monetary policy, all 19 of these principals—the seven governors and the 12 Federal Reserve Bank presidents—convene every six weeks as the FOMC under the leadership of the primus inter pares, the Federal Reserve Chairman.\n\nThe mandate of the FOMC is to preserve price and financial stability while conducting monetary policy so as to engender full employment. Think of the Federal Reserve this way: President Wilson and the Congress of the United States formed a central bank to mitigate the risks of Americans suffering through the economically desperate conditions my father experienced as a child. Like my dad, the Fed has made mistakes and has far from a spotless record. Its role in the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Great Inflation of the 1970s and the run-up to the financial panic and ensuing deep recession of 2007–09 come to mind. But over the course of its hundred-year lifetime, the Fed has successfully anchored America’s prosperity.\n\nCurrent Policy\n\nWhat about now? Are we doing the job we are supposed to do?\n\nAs you might imagine, given my roots as a half-Aussie and my being a full-blown Texan, and given that, as mentioned, the 12 Federal Reserve Bank presidents are not beholden to the president or Senate of the United States and fear no personal political retribution, I pull no punches when I discuss the U.S. economy and our monetary policy. The views I express today are my own and mine only.\n\nI say that the economy of the United States is hog-tied by a government that is sadly ineffective and, in fact, counterproductive. We have a government that hasn’t been able to agree on a budget in five years; that has historically, under both Republican and Democrat presidents and Congresses, spent money and committed itself to fund long-term programs without devising revenue streams to cover current costs or fund future liabilities. It is a government that is more effective at forming commissions to discuss what they might do—the president and Congress just recently have agreed to their ninth such commission in three years—than in getting anything done to provide businesses, employers, workers and the citizenry the certainty they need to confidently plan their futures.\n\nUnder these circumstances, it is no small wonder American businesses are not expanding and growing jobs at the pace we at the Fed would like to see. It is no small wonder that our economy is growing at a substandard pace compared to previous recoveries. It is no small wonder that the most expansive monetary policy the FOMC has ever engineered has been hampered from accomplishing what it set out to do. In short, while the Fed has been moving at the speed of a boomer in full run, the federal government of the United States has at best exhibited the adaptive alacrity of a koala (without being anywhere near as cute).[6]\n\nThis can be demonstrated with some simple math from the most elementary formula for calculating gross domestic product (GDP). Private expenditures on goods and services increased at a 3.2 percent rate over the expansion to date, whereas GDP has increased at 2.2 percent. One could say that GDP would have risen at 3.2 percent had government expenditure increased at the same rate as private expenditure. Or, more modestly, if government spending had just been held constant, instead of contracting, GDP would have grown at an annual rate of 2.6 percent.\n\nI am not a proponent of increasing government spending without restraint. And like most Aussies, I am averse to excessive government debt. I know that it is bothersome here that your debt-to-GDP ratio has risen to 30 percent presently from 18 percent before the global financial crisis. Indeed, I have been an outspoken critic of the U.S. government's fiscal promiscuity, which makes your 30 percent debt ratio look practically celibate by comparison.\n\nI mention this simply to illustrate a point: Unlike Australia—who could afford to ramp up spending during the financial crisis and even in the first half of 2013 through infrastructure spending to cushion the slowdown in mining—the excessively over-indebted U.S. government has, as mentioned, been hog-tied—prevented from providing stimulus. It has thus played a countercyclical, suppressive role. The inability of our government to get its act together has countered the procyclical role of the Federal Reserve. We have had to carry the ball solo. This is an unhealthy thing for any central bank and comes with not insignificant risks.\n\nLet me expand on this and describe, from my personal perspective, the pros and cons and cost/benefit analysis we must now consider as we contemplate future monetary policy.\n\n(The remaining remarks will be delivered from the podium).\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "October 17, 2013 New York City\n\nThank you Bill [Dudley]. It is a pleasure to be introduced by my colleague from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Bill is a friend as well as a colleague. Though it is our custom at the Federal Reserve to only speak for ourselves and never for any other member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), I think I can safely say that all 11 of Bill’s fellow Federal Reserve Bank presidents and, indeed, all the governors at the Federal Reserve Board, are grateful for Bill’s skillful leadership and total devotion to our collective mission. He is a hopeless golfer but a great human being. I want to take this opportunity to formally thank him for his service to the Fed and to our country.\n\nRobert Roosa and Wild Dreams\n\nIt is a very special honor for me to speak at the Economic Club of New York. My very first job after graduating from Stanford Business School was at Brown Brothers Harriman and Co. as the policy assistant to Robert Roosa. Bob Roosa was the proud chairman of the Economic Club from 1970 to 1971. He used to regale me with its history, of how anybody who was of consequence had spoken here, from Presidents Wilson and Eisenhower and Kennedy to Winston Churchill and Indira Gandhi and Zhu Rongji (and many others since).\n\nI mentioned this to my wife Nancy before flying up here. Without much humility, I asked her, “In your wildest dreams did you ever think that your husband would follow in the footsteps of the world’s great leaders and speak to the Economic Club of New York?” You know what her answer was? “Richard, we have been married for 40 years. You don’t appear in my wildest dreams.”\n\nThe Nightmare of Fiscal Policy\n\nI came to speak to you this morning not of pleasant dreams but of the nightmare of fiscal indecision and political chicanery that emanates from Washington, the risk it poses to the reputation of our nation, and the limits it imposes on monetary policy.\n\nI did not come to speak of whether or not we should or might “taper” our asset purchases at the next meeting of the FOMC. Or of how Janet Yellen will lead the committee when she succeeds Ben Bernanke. Or how I might vote when I rotate into a voter’s slot on the FOMC next year. I would be happy to avoid answering those and any other questions you might have during the Q&A session.\n\nErrol Flynn and Felix Rohatyn\n\nThe iconic actor Errol Flynn (who, to the best of my knowledge, was not a member of the Economic Club) is reported to have quipped that his legendary financial problems lay “in reconciling my gross habits with my net income.” This is the most concise description I can marshal to explain the problem plaguing our nation’s fiscal authorities. And it has not changed with the 11th-hour temporary agreement reached last night by the leaders of Congress and the president. Kicking the can down the road for a few months will not solve the pathology of fiscal misfeasance that undermines our economy and threatens our future.\n\nI have no doubt that we will go on indefinitely increasing the debt ceiling, be it in a regular or a herky-jerky, just-in-the-nick-of-time pattern. For no president or congressional leader dares risk being recorded in the history books as having consciously presided over default and the destruction of “the full faith and credit of the United States.” Republican or Democrat, all know full well that your fellow New Yorker, Felix Rohatyn, was spot-on some 37 years ago during New York’s great fiscal crisis when he likened default to “someone stepping into a tepid bath and slashing his wrists—you might not feel yourself dying, but that’s what would happen.”[1]\n\nBut there is, I believe, a limit of tolerance for our government’s fiscally counterproductive, Errol Flynn-like ways. I believe that razor in hand, we are stepping toward Rohatyn’s tepid bath and that the full faith and credit of the United States government is, in fact, at risk.\n\nHaircuts …\n\nWe saw an expression of this last Thursday when Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd. announced it would apply an increased “haircut” to its valuation of U.S. Treasury securities held as collateral against futures trades, with Treasuries maturing in less than one year receiving a risk discount of 3 percent. This was printed on Friday in a highlighted box above the fold on the front page of the Financial Times. Opposite was a picture of Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, who the paper reported had “signaled Beijing’s increasing concern at an Asian summit” and then provided a kindly no-wonder reminder that “China has about 60 percent of its $3.5 trillion foreign currency reserves invested in U.S. assets.”[2]\n\nThe FT could easily have substituted Premier Li’s picture with one of the German chancellor or the Japanese or British prime minister or the Mexican president, or any other world leader or business operator or simple observer of events, and ascribed to any of them a more explicit but surely pervasively held concern: “What the hell is happening to America?” Has the American ship of state, as Maureen Dowd wrote yesterday, turned into a “ship of fools”?[3]\n\n… and Tipping Points\n\nMy heart bleeds for my country, for no amount of monetary accommodation, no conceivable amount of “large-scale asset purchases,” no clever new monetary innovation by the Federal Reserve can offset the rot that is destroying our fiscal house and the blight it spreads over our economy.\n\nTo be clear, the Federal Reserve will take all appropriate measures to preserve money market functioning and stability in periods of acute distress. I view this as an integral part of our formal dual mandate. Chaotic money markets threaten both price stability and business activity and employment. However, it is not our job to fix the budget impasse. Any initiatives we might have to undertake in the course of our duty as a central bank to prevent serious disruptions of U.S. dollar funding markets should not be executed in a way that they might be construed to substitute for fiscal redress. Fundamental, structural imbalances in our economy might be temporarily obscured but cannot be permanently resolved by monetary sleight of hand.\n\nIndeed, I argue that the current monetary accommodation policy of purchasing $85 billion a month in Treasuries and MBS (mortgage-backed securities) risks exacerbating the situation: There is a tipping point where monetary accommodation comes to be viewed not as a pleasant stimulus that levitates bond and stock and housing markets leading to a felicitous “wealth effect,” but instead as an agent of financial recklessness. None of us really know where that tipping point is. But with each dollar of Treasury and MBS purchases the FOMC instructs the New York desk to make, we inch closer to it.\n\nFor the remainder of Ben Bernanke’s leadership and from the very first moment of his successor’s, the FOMC will have to astutely maneuver so as to avoid crossing a line that no Nobel laureate or econometric modeler or quant-jock or dealer or market operator can identify ex-ante.\n\nI admit to a preoccupation with this concern. This much I know: As long as inflationary expectations are held at bay, we can fully open the monetary throttle in an effort to deliver on the mandate Congress gave us to help achieve full employment. But it is for naught as long as the fiscal authorities are slamming on the brakes and leaving everyone in the dark as to how they will cure the fiscal mess they have wrought.\n\nNo rational businesswoman or man will or should make a long-term commitment to expanding their workforce or commit their precious capital to significant job-creating projects if they have no idea what their taxes will be or how government spending will impact them or their customers or suppliers. And no manager can plan or budget forward while simultaneously working under the yoke of ever-expanding regulations that render incalculable their cost structure, including the full-in cost of the most important variable in that cost structure—the workforce—as long as the Affordable Care Act remains more of a mystery than a clear, understandable program.\n\nThe creative capacity of American business for dealing with uncertainty is unparalleled. But doubts caused by fiscal malfunctioning so extreme that the “risk-free rate” of the world’s largest economy and reserve currency is called into question are of a different kind and character than the everyday uncertainties that even the most gifted manager is trained to handle. How does one discount the value of payables and receivables for next year when the world wonders if the U.S. government will validate the full value of Treasury bills?\n\nThe Fed to the Rescue?\n\nIt is true that unlike the Congress, the FOMC actually makes decisions and does so in a civil manner—both lost traits in Washington. But it is a myth that we have the power on our own to propel our economy forward. We can provide the fuel, but we can’t engage the gears of the engine of employment. Only businesses can do that. And businesses cannot do it when they haven’t an inkling of how the fiscal mess that is Washington will be resolved. The simple observation is that U.S. businesses and households need confidence that fiscal policy will be conducted responsibly—that revenues and expenditures will come into line, over time. Until that fog is lifted, do not expect the economy to steam forward at anything but a most cautious pace.\n\nAnnus Horribilis or …\n\nIn contemplating the fix we are in, I thought of a phrase used by Queen Elizabeth in her 1992 speech, marking the 40th anniversary of her accession to the throne. You may recall that was a year when a series of tragedies, including the burning of Windsor Castle, beset her family. With classic British understatement, she told her subjects: “1992 is not a year on which I shall look back with undiluted pleasure. … it has turned out to be an ‘Annus Horribilis’”—a “horrible year.”[4]\n\nWe have suffered much on the financial and economic front these past many years. And, in fact, since 1976 we have on 17 occasions under six of the last seven U.S. presidents experienced a federal government disruption, including shutdowns. Since 2010, we have had eight budget conventions, to no avail. And we’ve seen several face-offs on the debt ceiling. But the cumulative effect of our government’s fiscal ineptitude and propensity to put off taking action on hard decisions, and the frustration I feel about the inability of even the most radical monetary policy to work in the absence of long-term fiscal probity, has tempted me to record 2013 as an annus horribilis. It is certainly not shaping up to be a year on which I shall look back with undiluted pleasure.\n\nSound but Disagreeable\n\nIt need not be so horrible, however. In fact, it may be a year of good fortune if our president and congressional leaders summon the courage to put partisan gamesmanship aside and finally craft tax and spending and regulatory policy that encourages businesses to take the cheap and abundant money the Fed has made possible—the cheapest in the 237-year history of the Republic!—and put it to use creating jobs and expanding the wealth of the entire nation, not just that of rich and quick financiers and those with the means to speculate and profit from volatility.\n\nGetting these incentives right is not an easy task. But it is crucial.\n\nOne of the most exalted of the Economic Club’s long history of speakers, Winston Churchill, said, “In finance, everything that is agreeable is unsound and everything that is sound is disagreeable.” Continuing down the path of hypermonetary accommodation is certainly agreeable, especially if you are invested in stocks or bonds or have been able to refinance your mortgage and participate in the new housing boom. But carried on for too long, it is surely an unsound way to put our nation back on the path to respectability or eliminate the markets’ placing haircuts on the value of U.S. Treasuries.\n\nThe only way for us to achieve sound footing is for our fiscal leaders to make politically disagreeable decisions. There is no other way for us to regain and maintain our standing as the most prosperous and powerful economy in the history of the world.\n\nAnnus Mirabilis?\n\nI mentioned Queen Elizabeth’s annus horribilis. So as to not leave you despondent, I wish to remind you that the queen’s expression was a play on words in a poem written in 1667 by John Dryden, titled Annus Mirabilis—or Year of Miracles.\n\nDryden was writing about the year that spanned 1665 and 1666. It began with the Great Plague of London—a pandemic akin to the bubonic plague—and ended with the Great Fire that burned London for five days.\n\nSo why the title Year of Miracles? Because from the wreckage, London rebuilt itself and arose from the ashes, with wide streets and buildings commissioned by Charles II and designed by Christopher Wren that were so solidly constructed they last to this day. Our collective task is to turn the current annus horribilis into an opportunity to emerge from the current fiscal wreckage stronger and more resilient than ever. If England could do it in the 17th century, we Americans, who have never, ever flinched from staring down and overcoming adversity, can certainly do it now.\n\nI am tempted to remind you of how Texas arose from the ashes of the 1980s oil bust and savings-and-loan crisis to lead the nation in job creation for several decades and become one of our most prosperous states. But I am not going to do so.\n\nI was going to tell you how in the Texas renaissance, as the U.S. has seen job destruction in the two middle-income quartiles for the past decade, Texas has seen job creation in those same middle-income groups and has outperformed the nation in creating jobs in the highest-income quartile, too. But I won’t.\n\nI am tempted to tell you that Texas came off the bottom to become the top exporting state in the United States. But I shan’t. Or that state laws and regulations crafted with the 1980s banking crisis in mind spared Texas the worst of the recent housing crisis.\n\nAll these factors, of which I won’t breathe a word, have resulted in a workforce of some 12.8 million and, in 2006, catapulted the state to its ranking as the top destination for people who move across states. Americans and immigrants alike come to Texas to seek jobs and opportunity in what continues to be the nation’s most dynamic economy. I could tell you about that, but I will refrain from Texas brag.\n\nNew York, New York\n\nInstead, let me point to New York as an example of what is possible.\n\nSome of you may remember the predicament in which New York found itself in 1975, the year I came to work at Brown Brothers. It was de facto bankrupt. Garbage piled up on the streets. Crime was rampant. Upper East Side apartments could be had simply for the assumption of maintenance costs. Nothing worked. Everything was dysfunctional. The outlook was so horrific that Mick Jagger wrote “Shattered” after a cab ride around the city. Remember the lyrics? “What a mess, this town’s in tatters/I’ve been shattered, my brain’s been battered/Splattered all over Manhattan …”\n\nThen, when the markets showed the city the back of its hand, leaders such as Felix Rohatyn and Gov. [Hugh] Carey and others stepped up to the plate. They and the people of New York turned something truly horribilis into a thing mirabilis. Disagreeable but sound decisions were made. Those decisions took a tattered, shattered city and put it on the path to becoming the bright, shiny, miraculous Big Apple that it is today.\n\nA Plea\n\nThe Federal Reserve is limited in its power to make what took place in New York happen for our nation, and unless the fiscal authorities get their act together, looking to the Fed to solve the nation’s economic ills through ever-expansive monetary policy might well make the situation worse. So I end with a plea for our president and our Congress. The markets are restless. Your peers around the world are afraid. There is little remaining tolerance for agreeable but unsound decisions. The bond market is beginning to show us the back of its hand. It is time for leadership. Turning something horrible into something miraculous is the American thing to do. Please get on with it.\n\nThank you.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "October 8, 2013 Houston\n\nThank you for coming. This is a significant day in the life of U.S. currency.\n\nWe are here today to announce that we are putting into general circulation the newly redesigned $100 bill — which is the most sophisticated piece of currency the United States has ever produced.\n\nThe $100 note is the most widely circulated and most often counterfeited U.S. bill around the world, and this new note incorporates advanced technology to combat counterfeiting.\n\nWe estimate that nearly two-thirds of $100 bills circulate outside the U.S. That is why it’s important for our nation to stay ahead of counterfeiting and maintain the integrity of our currency.\n\nStarting today — any commercial bank, savings and loan, or credit union that orders $100 notes from the Federal Reserve will receive this new design. Consumers can expect to find it in their hands in a matter of days, depending upon where they bank.\n\nAs you know, U.S. currency is printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, an arm of the Treasury Department. The BEP then ships the bills to the Federal Reserve Banks, which put them into circulation through financial institutions. We at the Federal Reserve like to point out that all U.S. bills are technically Federal Reserve Notes.\n\nAll U.S. currency is printed at the BEP’s plants in Washington, D.C., and Fort Worth, Texas. Those are the only two places in the world where U.S. money is printed — legally printed.\n\nWe are particularly proud of the new $100 note because the vast majority of them have been printed in Fort Worth. When you receive one, you may notice a small “FW” printed on the front. This, of course, designates the work of the Fort Worth facility.\n\nSo in this great state — with its strong economy — not only do we make money in Texas, but we make money in Texas.\n\nSo what’s so special about this bill, besides its Texas roots? There are a good number of anti-counterfeiting measures designed into this new issuance, but consumers will quickly notice two new features.\n\nFirst, on the front of the note, you’ll find a blue 3-D security ribbon. This ribbon is woven into the paper, not printed on it. The ribbon features images of the Liberty Bell and the numeral 100.\n\nIf you tilt the note back and forth, the bells change to100s as they move side to side. If you tilt the note side to side, the bells and 100s move up and down.\n\nAlso, on the front, there is a bell in an inkwell. This is a color-shifting bell inside a copper inkwell. The inkwell and bell are both copper. When you tilt the note back and forth, the bell changes from copper to green.\n\nThe bill retains the watermark portrait of Benjamin Franklin, visible when you hold the bill up to light.\n\nThese anti-counterfeiting measures are incorporated not only to deter bad guys from replicating our money, but also to help protect consumers and business operators from losses. It only takes a few seconds to check the new $100 bill to make sure it’s real.\n\nSimply put — these bills are hard to replicate but easy to authenticate.\n\nRemember, if you receive a counterfeit bill — of any denomination — you cannot turn it in for a genuine note. So it’s important to know what real money looks like.\n\nAll of this may lead people to believe there is a large-scale counterfeiting problem in the U.S., and that’s not the case. Few U.S. notes are reported counterfeit.\n\nThis new $100 note is our latest proactive step to ensure America stays ahead of counterfeiting technology around the world.\n\nIt’s important for consumers to know that it is not necessary to trade in their old $100 bills for new ones. All designs of U.S. currency remain legal tender, regardless of when they were issued. The United States has never recalled, de-monetized or de-valued its currency as updated bills were issued.\n\nAs the older designs make their way through the banking system, they will eventually get returned to the Federal Reserve, where they will be recycled. We think of it as sending the old bills to money heaven.\n\nThis process ensures that the money consumers receive from banks is safe, fit and secure.\n\nThank you all for coming.\n\nThis concludes our formal remarks, but we have several officials here from the Federal Reserve — including myself — who will be happy to answer your questions.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "October 3, 2013 Dallas\n\nThank you, Evan [Koenig].[1]\n\nIt is a pleasure to share this platform with John Taylor. I first met John at a Carnegie Foundation seminar when he was Undersecretary of the Treasury; I have been among the legions of his admirers ever since. He is thoughtful, no-nonsense and, importantly, dedicated to making monetary policy work with maximum efficacy. We at the Dallas Fed are grateful that he chairs the advisory board of our Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute. And we all, as Americans, are grateful for his service and dedication to our country. Thank you, John, for being the good patriot and man that you are.\n\nUncertainty Matters\n\nUncertainty matters. A lot.\n\nThis won’t be a surprise to many of you. The first thing you are taught in any MBA program, be it at Stanford, where I earned my degree, or anywhere else, is that “business” is the process of managing under conditions of uncertainty. All business executives worth their salt organize their teams and resources to minimize uncertainty of factors under their control; and they develop contingencies and operating tactics and strategies for factors over which they have no direct control. Obviously, the less-clear external influences are, the greater the degree of angst about budgeting and planning for the future. Even the saltiest of helmsmen cannot confidently navigate a ship in a dense fog.\n\nGoing back to the earliest days of the current recovery, my business contacts have regularly complained of the fog of uncertainty emanating from Washington: They have consistently cited fiscal and regulatory uncertainty as major impediments to capital investment and expanding payrolls. Given uncertainty about the implications for overhead of the Affordable Care Act and other government mandates, they’ve complained of not knowing what their all-in labor and other costs will be and of how that lack of knowledge has made long-term employment planning nearly impossible. I’m sure that many of you have heard similar complaints—or have voiced them yourselves.\n\nWhat you may not realize is that until quite recently, economists who study business cycles and monetary policy paid scant attention to the effects of uncertainty on aggregate job and output growth. The profession’s standard models assume that the economy is populated with households and firms that are identical to one another, or that people and businesses can insure away individual risk and so are effectively, theoretically, identical. It’s become standard practice, too, to assume that decision-makers are hyper-rational in how they form their expectations of future policy and future events; they are assumed to fully understand how the economy works. To be sure, the economy is subject to shocks, so that its course is unpredictable. But that uncertainty, according to this school of theory, is of no real consequence for households’ decisions about how much to save and consume, or businesses’ decisions about how much to hire and invest. The technical term is “certainty equivalence”: In standard models, choices depend on what you expect will happen and not on the degree to which you are confident in your predictions.\n\nSuch thinking is far removed from reality and, thankfully, there’s increasing recognition of that fact. A variety of uncertainty indexes have been developed and their importance in theory and in practice examined.[2] Pretty uniformly, these studies suggest that changes in uncertainty have significant economic effects and that uncertainty has been elevated in recent years.\n\nIn theoretical analyses, the impact of uncertainty is especially great when realistic financial and informational frictions prevent risk from being spread optimally. Because of such frictions, for example, debt contracts often require that borrowers post collateral. When uncertainty increases, so do collateral requirements, tightening credit and increasing the value of “safe” assets relative to other assets.[3]\n\nThere’s more than one type of uncertainty. There’s uncertainty about future average tax rates on investment income, for example, or the future pace of average labor productivity gains. This is aggregate uncertainty. There is also uncertainty that widens the distribution of asset returns across firms or the distribution of income prospects across households, while leaving aggregate average asset returns and aggregate average productivity prospects unchanged. This is cross-sectional uncertainty. Finally, there’s the uncertainty that you feel when you think that you understand how the world works and then discover that you don’t because something happens that you thought unlikely to happen.[4] In the extreme, these are “black swan” events: the “oh spit” moments we experience when we realize that we have fundamentally and disastrously miscalculated.\n\nBlack swans induce paradigm shifts: The world—or, at least, our thinking about the world—is never the same again. The Great Depression was one such event. The housing-market collapse that began in 2006 and then spilled over to financial markets is another. If the U.S. government defaults on its debt later this month, we’ll have a third example. The unthinkable will have become real, and the “full faith and credit” of the United States will be a mirage rather than accepted fact.\n\nThere are myriad other events that, on a much smaller scale, lead people to question their understanding of the rules. For example, the recent decision of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to maintain the pace of its large-scale asset purchases in the face of a generally improving labor market outlook and a widespread perception within financial markets, right or wrong, that the Fed had telegraphed a dialing back of the rate of purchases may have increased uncertainty about the future path of monetary policy. That was one argument raised against the decision not to taper. I know, because I made the argument, and I was not alone.\n\nMost real-world fiscal and regulatory uncertainty is a mix of aggregate and cross-sectional uncertainty. Given the aging of the U.S. population, we know that the revenues required to finance entitlement programs will certainly have to increase in coming decades. “Entitlement reform” may ameliorate the problem but won’t eliminate it. Government purchases will have to be cut, relative to baseline projections, and tax revenues will certainly have to be increased. But exactly which programs will be cut and which taxes increased, and when, is unclear and has been further muddled by the behavior of fiscal policy makers these past few days.\n\nThe financial crisis and subsequent recession exacerbated these problems by increasing the outstanding stock of debt. U.S. federal government debt held by the public has increased from 34 percent of potential GDP at the business-cycle peak in first quarter 2001 (shortly before the 9/11 attacks) to 36 percent in fourth quarter 2007 (just prior to the Great Recession) to 70 percent of potential GDP today.\n\nThis increased debt has been manageable as a result of a substantial fall in interest rates. Indeed, interest on the public debt has trended downward from 4.7 percent of potential GDP in 1990 to 3.2 percent in 2007 to just 2.1 percent in 2012 as the average interest rate on Treasury securities has dropped from 9 percent to 5 percent, then to its recent level of 2½ percent. Rates obviously cannot continue to fall, though, so the cost of servicing debt is sure to increase, even if the size of the debt relative to the economy stabilizes.\n\nThe Canary in the Mine: Capital Investment\n\nCapital investment is the economy’s canary in the mine because it’s often the first thing to succumb to uncertainty. Also, once undertaken, capital investment is costly to reverse.\n\nInvestment has certainly been unusually sluggish in the wake of the recent recession. Going back to when our data begin, in 1947, net investment as a percent of GDP has fluctuated around a constant mean of 5.6 percent.[5] It boomed in the late 1990s, reaching 8.1 percent of GDP, its highest level in over 50 years. The only higher quarter on record was the second quarter of 1950 (shortly after John Taylor and I came into this world, although I am not implying causality). Its peak during the 2001–07 expansion was an unremarkable 6.9 percent, but the subsequent plunge was unprecedented in the post-World War II data: The U.S. capital stock actually shrank during the second half of 2009. Relative to its 5.6 percent long-run average, net investment as a percent of GDP fell by twice as far as it had in any prior postwar recession.\n\nMore to the point, the recovery in investment has been exceptionally anemic. Today, four full years after the trough of the recession in second quarter 2009, net investment as a percent of GDP is still only 3.2 percent—a level typical of past recession lows. Net investment as a percent of GDP was last at or above its 5.6 percent long-run mean 6½ years ago.\n\nSmall wonder then that nonfarm payroll employment has been slow to recover too. Through August we had restored less than 80 percent of the 8.7 million jobs lost during the Great Recession. Less well known is the fact that real GDP per capita only recovered its prerecession peak this past summer.[6] That’s 5½ years to make up the ground lost during the recession. Previous post-WWII recoveries never required more than nine quarters maximum. A Dallas Fed analysis suggests that the recent financial crisis and its aftermath put the U.S. back by more than an entire year’s worth of output, an equivalent of more than $120,000 per American household.[7]\n\nBaker-Bloom-Davis and Better Comprehending Uncertainty\n\nAnd what of uncertainty? I mentioned earlier that we now have several uncertainty indexes. One of these, focused on measuring policy uncertainty, was developed by our moderator, Nick Bloom, together with Scott Baker at Stanford and Steven Davis of the University of Chicago. The index is based on three different types of information: (1) a count of articles referencing uncertainty, the economy and policy that have appeared in prominent U.S. newspapers (including the nation’s premier paper, the Dallas Morning News); (2) a weighted count of tax-code provisions that are scheduled to expire; and (3) the extent to which professional forecasters disagree with one another about future levels of inflation and government purchases.\n\nThe Baker-Bloom-Davis index begins in January 1985 and runs through the present. High values of the index signal an elevated level of economic policy uncertainty. From 1985 through 2007—prior to the 2008–09 recession—the index has a mean of 94, and it exceeds 150 only 2 percent of the time (one month in 50; just six times in over 23 years). The index rose to above-average levels in the fall of 2007 and stayed at or above 94—but below 150—through the summer of 2008. Then, between August and September 2008, the index nearly doubled, rising from 96 to 188. Since September 2008, the index has at no time dropped below 100, and it has exceeded 150 on 31 occasions—more than half the time. It has soared above 200 twice: for two months in 2011, coincident with that year’s debt-ceiling debate, and in December 2012, when a compromise implementation of sequestration was being hammered out. It’ll be interesting to see what happens with the index in the wake of the past week’s developments (or lack thereof) in Washington.\n\nThe point is that starting with the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, economic policy uncertainty has been consistently high, and half the time it has been extraordinarily high. It’s difficult to prove “beyond a reasonable doubt” that this elevated uncertainty is causally related to the weak recovery we’ve experienced. But the hypothesis is surely sensible, the timing is certainly auspicious, and enough careful confirming analysis has been done to say that the preponderance of evidence favors the proposition that not just recent policy decisions, but also the manner in which those decisions were arrived at, have been a significant hindrance to economic expansion.\n\nThe Kinky Stuff: Monetary Policy\n\nAs to monetary policy, I would submit there are several links between monetary policy and economic uncertainty. First, though, some background.\n\nOrdinarily, monetary policy works by influencing the current and expected near-term levels of short-term interest rates. Once short-term interest rates hit zero, however, the Fed turned to unconventional policies. By using massive purchases of longer-term Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities, these policies helped hold down term premia and support the housing recovery. Simultaneously, the Fed tried—and I emphasize tried because the message seems to have been garbled in the minds of some intended recipients—to influence expectations of its own behavior once asset purchases have run their course. These “asset-purchase” and “forward-guidance” policies are relatively unfamiliar, and their impact is uncertain.\n\nOne implication is that aggregate fiscal shocks—and, hence, also aggregate fiscal uncertainties—are likely to have outsize effects in current circumstances. Contractionary fiscal policy that would ordinarily drive down interest rates, providing offsetting stimulus to private expenditure, will have a larger-than-typical economic impact because this “crowding in” is absent once interest rates are confined to the zero lower bound. Expansionary fiscal policy, similarly, will fail to “crowd out” private expenditure if interest rates hold steady.\n\nSecond, because the zero bound complicates the conduct of monetary policy and short-circuits fiscal crowding out, it introduces a “kink,” or discontinuity, in the economy’s behavior. The existence of a kink means that uncertainty matters even if ordinarily it would not: “Certainty equivalence” no longer applies. When real growth and/or inflation prospects are weak—so that the economy is operating near the zero bound—downside risks to growth and inflation loom larger than they ordinarily would. More-aggressive-than-usual policy responses may be appropriate to avoid the negative implications of an encounter with the zero bound.\n\nParadoxically, though, once the lower bound on interest rates is binding, a less-than-usually-aggressive monetary policy response may be appropriate. I have tried to articulate this in FOMC meetings ever since we started down the path of quantitative easing, drawing on anecdotal reports from my CEO contacts and what I thought was common sense. But my arguments fell on deaf ears until my more learned counterpart at the San Francisco Fed, John Williams, produced a formal study that posited that the aggressive use of unfamiliar policy tools like quantitative easing and Operation Twist add to aggregate economic uncertainty and, if applied at all, should be deployed more cautiously than our more familiar tools.[8]\n\nLarge Margins of Error\n\nIn general, the objective of monetary policy is to provide households and firms with an economic environment that makes it attractive to use money as medium of exchange and store of value. Since many private contracts, including labor and debt contracts as well as capital expenditure commitments, extend out several years, a multiyear policy perspective is needed. A multiyear perspective is especially important when the economy may encounter the zero bound. The explanation is that by interfering with the normal conduct of monetary policy, the zero bound increases the likelihood that policy will miss its objectives year after year in the same direction, so that the errors accumulate over time.\n\nOver the past five years, for example, PCE inflation has averaged 1.2 percent per year. The FOMC’s announced long-term inflation objective is 2.0 percent. Over a single year, the difference between 1.2 percent and 2.0 percent inflation is inconsequential. Over five years, though, that small difference cumulates to a 4.26 percentage point difference in the price level, which is not insignificant, perhaps, if back in 2008 you took out a mortgage with a five-year balloon. Alternatively, nominal GDP growth over the past five years has averaged 2.4 percent per year, when ordinarily one might have expected 4.5 percent average annual growth (2.5 percent real growth plus 2.0 percent inflation). Again, the difference is inconsequential in any given year. Accumulated over five years, though, the level of nominal income today is fully 12 percent below what might reasonably have been expected when mortgage and auto loan agreements were made back in 2008.\n\nKindly note that I am not advocating any change to the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation target. My point is simply to highlight the longer-term consequences of what might appear to be smallish, shorter-term deviations from the norm. Business operators plan capital expenditure and payrolls not in one- or two- or even three-year increments; they plan and budget over longer-term horizons. The nominal stability that people need if they are going to negotiate multiyear contracts is a multiyear nominal stability. A policy that “lets bygones be bygones” from year to year may not achieve this kind of stability, especially when policy options can become constrained, in the short term, by the zero bound. A policy that takes a longer-term perspective and is properly communicated and executed—so as to instill confidence that monetary policy will hew to a 2 percent inflation target rather than fixate on the run-rate of the past four quarters or the outlook for the next four—may better supply the longer-term comfort that households and businesses need to plan and budget. Such a policy would reduce the uncertainty that monetary policy as it is currently conducted spawns and would be more effective in doing its part to assist in economic expansion.[9]\n\nA Dime Between Two Nickels\n\nI hope this is enough to get a conversation started. I will now turn the microphone over to John Taylor. In doing so, I am reminded of Ross Perot’s quip when he was placed between Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush for a predebate photograph in the 1992 presidential election. Noting that Mr. Perot was substantially shorter than the other two men, a reporter asked him how he felt. His reply: “I feel like a dime between two nickels.” In contrast, compared to John Taylor, I feel like an intellectual dwarf—a mere penny sitting on the dais next to John’s $100 bill brain. And I’m talking about the new, difficult to replicate $100 bill that will be released next Tuesday. Please join me in welcoming John Taylor to the podium.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "September 23, 2013 San Antonio\n\nThank you, Chris [Williston]. I am honored and delighted to speak to you all today. I understand that Danny King's daughter, Amy, arranged quite a songwriters' show for you last night. I heard it was so good that Ann Worthy, my head regulator at the Dallas Fed, stayed up past midnight … for the first time in 40 years.\n\nI am going to start today by reviewing current banking trends for the nation and for the Eleventh Federal Reserve District.\n\nThen, as there has been a great deal of reflection in the press and blogosphere on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy and the ensuing global financial crisis, I want to briefly provide you an overview of what the crisis cost us as a nation and the work remaining to prevent a reoccurrence of a crisis, a subject I will be addressing in a more fulsome manner in a speech and a public debate in New York in mid-October.\n\nLast, I will comment briefly on last week’s FOMC meeting and what some have referred to as “the taper caper,” doing my utmost to deflect your criticism.\n\nTexas’ Superior Bank Performance\n\nFirst, let’s discuss how banks in the Eleventh Federal Reserve District are performing in the context of national trends. Recall that the district includes some 27 million people sprawled across approximately 360,000 square miles in southern New Mexico, Texas and the wooded north of Louisiana. Over 96 percent of the economic output and the district’s banking assets are in Texas, so you might reasonably say I am speaking of the performance of Texas banks versus banks in the U.S. as a whole.\n\n\n\nProfitability is fairly strong across the nation, helped in part by a continued decline in provision expense. Asset quality continues to improve, and lending activity continues to grow nationally. These national trends are consistent with what we have seen over the last several quarters.\n\nYou should take pride in knowing that Eleventh District and Texas banks are outperforming the rest of the nation’s banks.\n\nLet’s look at comparative return on assets (ROA):\n\n\n\nProfitability trends over the last several years as measured by ROA show that district banks continue to outperform banks nationwide, with an ROA of 1.15 percent versus 1.12 percent for all U.S. banks.\n\nWhile moving in the right direction, banks still have a little more work to do before their profitability reaches precrisis levels.\n\nProvision expense is worth noting:\n\n\n\nFalling provision expense has contributed to improved earnings trends for both U.S. and district banks. Declines in the amount banks set aside to cover bad loans have importantly contributed to improved profitability over the last several years. This, however, is not likely to be the case moving forward.\n\nBanks nationwide and in the district are now reporting provisions below precrisis levels. In the case of our district banks, provision expense as a percentage of average assets is almost half of what was reported in 2006.\n\nIt doesn’t look like profitability is going to be bolstered much by net interest margin (NIM), either.\n\n\n\nThe NIM for banks across the U.S. has continued to trend lower over the past two decades; in the district, the trend has been observed over the past decade. It is noteworthy that the most recent decline in NIM is certainly affected by the zero lower bound on short-term interest rates.[1]\n\nAs you can see in this chart, district banks continue to report a slightly higher margin at 3.33 percent versus 3.25 percent for banks nationwide.\n\nNow let’s look at how profitability differs nationally by bank asset size:\n\n\n\nROA has considerably improved in all size classes—banks with asset sizes of less than $10 billion and between $10 billion and $250 billion, and the largest banks, those with assets greater than $250 billion.\n\nThe upward trend in ROA tapers off by 2013 for community and midsize banks, while profitability for the dozen or so big banks—the cohort that includes banks considered “too big to fail” (TBTF)—shoots up rather dramatically. The Big Guys earned a ROA of 1.26 percent versus 1.04 percent for the community banks.\n\nThis chart shows the major profitability components for the asset size classes we just discussed:\n\n\n\nStarting from the bottom up, you can see that the ROA for the biggest banks is 22 basis points above that for community banks. Recall that Eleventh District banks earned 1.15 percent ROA; thus, the Big Guys outpace even the relatively stronger performance of our healthy banks in and around Texas.\n\nThis gap is being driven by a couple of things: The largest banks have lower noninterest expense; some would say this is due to economies of scale. These Big Guys also recorded much higher noninterest income—a full 100 basis points higher. These two items were more than enough to offset the lower net interest income reported by the biggest banks.\n\nHaving noted that big gap, let’s focus on the noninterest-income component for a minute and look at how it has impacted earnings trends for the Big Guys.\n\n\n\nThis chart shows noninterest income and its components for each of the three size classes of banks for 2012 and 2013.[2] As you can see, noninterest income was virtually unchanged for the community and midsize banks, while noninterest income has increased for the largest banks, from 1.89 percent of average assets in 2012 to 2.09 percent in 2013. Looking at the components of noninterest income, you can see that the growth has been driven by an increase in trading revenue.\n\nTrading revenue is a noncore/nontraditional income source that is typically not available to community and the smaller midsize banks. It is thus more difficult for these smaller institutions to return to their historical norms or even compete in traditional lending with the Big Guys, whose lending activities, in a sense, are subsidized by their trading activities. We are receiving numerous reports from community and regional banks in the Eleventh District that the lending terms and standards of big banks are becoming increasingly lax.\n\nAs you know, a common measure of asset quality is the noncurrent loan ratio, the percentage of a bank’s loans 90 or more days past due or on nonaccrual status. Here’s a comparison of noncurrent loans for U.S. versus district banks:\n\n\n\nWe’ve seen fairly dramatic improvement in asset quality over the last several years, with the noncurrent ratio declining to 3.07 percent for banks nationwide and 1.55 percent for those in the district. You can see from this chart that banks in Texas and the district continue to outperform banks nationwide.\n\nMost of you remember the legendary Bob Hankins, who retired last year after 20 years as head of Banking Supervision at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Bob received an award last year at this very luncheon. He had a saying that Texas banks were “twice as good and half as bad” as banks nationwide. That remains the case, though banks around the U.S. are slowly catching up with Texas, and you can also see from the chart that banks here and in the U.S. still have some work to do to get noncurrent loans down to precrisis levels.\n\nHow about the so-called Texas ratio—a measure of noncurrent loans plus other real estate owned expressed as a percentage of equity plus loan loss reserves?[3] This became a scarlet letter in the late 1980s when 20 percent of Texas banks had a Texas ratio exceeding 100 percent. However, in 2013 only 0.7 percent of Texas banks had a Texas ratio greater than 100 percent, compared with 2.5 percent nationwide—and that nationwide number is down from a 5.7 percent peak in fourth quarter 2010.\n\nNote what is labeled on the center right side of the chart as the “Wells Fargo-South Central effect.” Wells Fargo relocated a charter to Houston in 2009 and moved a large volume of mortgage loans into the district, triggering the increase in nonperforming residential real estate. (If the Wells Fargo-South Central effect is excluded from the 2009 data, the noncurrent loan ratio falls by 71 basis points for the district.)\n\nNow here is something I consider particularly noteworthy about our district: our loan growth and its composition.\n\n\n\nLoan growth on a year-over-year basis remains good, but it decelerated a bit for the nation in the second quarter to 3.74 percent. In contrast, loan growth for district banks ticked up slightly to 5.72 percent, almost 200 basis points above the nationwide average.\n\nOf interest, you can see from this multiyear chart that loan growth for banks nationwide hooks downward in the first half of 2013, while in the district, it turns upward.\n\nHere’s a closer look at loan growth between June of 2012 and 2013:\n\n\n\nYou can see in this chart how business loans contributed to total loan growth nationwide and in the district. Business loans grew 6.8 percent for banks nationwide and 4.8 percent for those in the district.\n\nWe do, however, continue to see pockets of weakness. Small-business lending was down 36 basis points year over year for banks in the U.S., while it increased only 1.6 percent districtwide.[4]\n\nSo let me summarize all of this:\n\n\n\nProfitability continues to trend upward, although when we will make it back to precrisis levels remains to be seen. Asset quality is improving, but there is more work to be done. Lending continues to rebound: We’ve seen seven consecutive quarters of growth nationwide. However, areas of weakness remain, particularly small-business lending.\n\nThe issue of small-business lending and the difference between the drivers of income for the largest banks and those with less than $250 billion in assets is a reminder of a lingering problem: The coddling, whether intentionally or otherwise, of the biggest of the big banks—those considered too big to fail.\n\nFive Years After Lehman, We Still Have a Big Problem\n\nWorking with Harvey Rosenblum and my colleagues at the Dallas Fed, I have been a constant burr under the saddle of the too big to fails. In a nutshell, I believe that the megabanks are inherently handicapped by their size and scale in practicing the basic principle of banking: Know your customer. Extreme size and complexity have proven to be the enemy of prudence and the source of costly mistakes. Mathematically based risk-management models, while theoretically comforting, have their deficiencies. We learned during the recent crisis just how perilous those deficiencies can be.\n\nWe at the Dallas Fed believe, based on the experience of the last five years, that the largest financial institutions are a dagger pointed at the heart of our economy. We are not alone. Even the local paper in the denizen of the megabanks, the New York Times, recently editorialized regarding the controversies surrounding JPMorgan Chase: “The underlying problem is not only this or that violation, but the fact that the sheer size and scope and complexity of the banking behemoths defy controls, encouraging speculation and bad behavior.”[5]\n\nWe at the Dallas Fed would add that they undermine free-market capitalism and jeopardize our economic welfare. But we would note that it is unfair to single out JPMorgan Chase as a culprit. It is only one of a set of megabanks that remain a threat to financial stability. Indeed, Bob Diamond, the former head of the megabank Barclays, recently warned in a Financial Times op-ed that additional steps are needed “if we are to avoid the kind of capital regulatory arbitrage that weakened the financial system.”[6]\n\nAnd on Friday, the Wall Street Journal’s lead editorial said: “The policy of too big to fail has been codified and expanded. Dodd–Frank lets Washington’s wise men define ‘systemically important’ institutions subject to stricter regulation … [But] Dodd–Frank’s … great conceit is that in a crisis these firms will be wound down without a rescue. They even have to provide ‘living wills’ that are supposed to plan the funeral. But the law also gives regulators the freedom to protect creditors as they see fit, which they will surely do in a panic. The difference next time will be that more firms will be deemed too big to fail.” The Journal’s editorial highlighted this in bold print: “The financial system is more regulated than ever, but also no safer.”[7]\n\nIt would appear that the editors of these three great newspapers have been reading my speeches and Congressional testimony! They seem to agree with me and Harvey that TBTFs or “systemically important financial institutions” (SIFIs) might easily again play the nefarious role they did five years ago in bringing down our economic and financial system. (The acronym SIFI sounds like some kind of communicable disease transmitted through reckless behavior. In the event of another crisis brought on by the behavior that SIFIs still appear to have leeway to engage in, my guess is the acronym would come to stand for “Save If Failure Impending”).\n\nAm I exaggerating when I say that the TBTFs are a dagger pointed at the heart of the economy?\n\nTo be sure, there were many causes and tripwires for the financial debacle from which we are still struggling to recover—a debacle that we at the Dallas Fed estimate cost more than an entire year’s worth of U.S. economic output, or more than $120,000 per American household.[8] Among those causes and tripwires were the unbridled advent of toxic forms of structured finance, complicity by the ratings agencies, and even the Fed’s own role: keeping interest rates too low for too long, rebuffing Fed Governor [Edward] Gramlich’s attempts to regulate subprime lending, and blessing the increased consolidation of banking.\n\nAs my Dallas Fed colleague, John Duca, gently reminds me, there was more than a little “we have met the enemy and he is us” that contributed to the perfect storm of forces that led our economy into that frightful and costly tailspin.[9]\n\nBut still, the TBTF behemoths were indisputably what the Bank of England’s Andy Haldane called “super-spreaders” of the virus that brought our financial system and economy to its knees.[10] They retain that potential today. For in the aftermath of the crisis and the passage of Dodd–Frank, the giants have gotten bigger, and the profitability of the community and regional banks that might pose meaningful, healthy competition has been undermined by the legislation’s complexity.\n\nDodd–Frank claims to end TBTF. Instead, as the Wall Street Journal editorialized, it entrenches the TBTF pathology. The megabanks remain a potential lethal force. As mentioned, I will be speaking at length on this subject in New York in October.\n\nA Deliberate Deflection\n\nAs I said at the beginning of my remarks, I am going to try to avoid answering questions you might have about last week’s FOMC meeting and what some in the press have now labeled “the taper caper.” Nearly every Federal Reserve Bank president and his or her sister will be speaking to this topic this week, so you will be getting an earful of cacophonous comments on this subject.\n\nToday, I will simply say that I disagreed with the decision of the committee and argued against it. Here is a direct quote from the summation of my intervention at the table during the policy “go round” when Chairman [Ben] Bernanke called on me to speak on whether or not to taper: “Doing nothing at this meeting would increase uncertainty about the future conduct of policy and call the credibility of our communications into question.” I believe that is exactly what has occurred, though I take no pleasure in saying so.\n\nEnough said. Thank you for what you do for the business and citizens of Texas. And thank you for listening.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "August 22, 2013 Orlando, Florida\n\nEvery morning there is a quote of the day on the ubiquitous Bloomberg screens. Monday’s was especially apt for today’s conference. It was from Frank Sinatra: “The best revenge is massive success.”\n\nBill Simon asked me to provide context for your discussion of a manufacturing revival in the U.S.A. I am delighted to do so. It is well-nigh time for us to once again become a “massive success” in manufacturing. But there are obstacles to doing so. If our manufacturing sector is to experience a lasting renaissance, significant changes in fiscal policy and regulation that emanate from Washington are sorely needed.\n\nFirst, some historical context. Look at this chart:\n\n\n\nU.S. manufacturing production was ramped up to fight the Second World War and, as you can see, declined precipitously after the war’s end. Then starting in 1947 or thereabouts, manufacturing output in America picked up slowly at first, adjusting to a post-WWII world, before accelerating to an expansion rate of 4.6 percent per annum from the time of the election of President Kennedy until Paul Volcker’s Fed broke the back of inflation and engineered a recession at the end of the 1970s. During the high-tech revolution of the 1990s, manufacturing production took off at a torrid pace, then bounced back from the tech wreck of the early 2000s until hitting the brick wall of the financial panic of 2007 and the severe recession that ensued.\n\nThe downturn in U.S. manufacturing output during the 2007–09 recession was on the order of 20 percent, the worst setback but for the defense-related decline following WWII and the 54 percent decline experienced during the Great Depression. Manufacturing output today is still about 5 percent below its December 2007 business-cycle peak.[1]\n\nAs for employment, manufacturing payrolls fell 16.6 percent between December 2007 and January 2010. They are still 12.9 percent below where they stood 5 ½ years ago.\n\nThis raises the issue of productivity enhancement. Look at this chart:\n\n\n\nSince the end of the post-WWII recession, manufacturers’ share of the nation’s payrolls has been in continual decline. Whereas at war’s end they represented 33 percent of nonfarm payrolls, today they account for less than 10 percent. To be sure, this reflects a rise in our nation’s prosperity: As nations grow richer, they produce and consume more services. Today, manufacturing accounts for only about 12 percent of gross domestic product. The divergence between trends in job and output shares is largely accounted for by a relentless drive by manufacturers to increase productivity. Workers today are dramatically more productive than the workers of our parents’ and grandparents’ generations because technology has enabled them to produce more with fewer hours worked and at less cost.\n\nThis is not going to change. The iconic economist, Joseph Schumpeter, coined the phrase “creative destruction.” In plain English, this means “out with the old, in with the new.” Americans are masters of replacing outdated methods with new ones. And it is by mastering new technology, new methodologies, and new techniques that we have the hope of revitalizing and bringing back to our shores a greater amount of the world’s manufacturing, regaining what was lost since the recession and—perhaps—bending upward the long-term manufacturing employment curve.\n\nNow here is more recent history:\n\n\n\nI have been saying for the past few years that the United States is the “best-looking horse in the glue factory.” This is certainly true in manufacturing. We have actually been outperforming the rest of the world on the manufacturing front as the recovery from the Great Recession has gained traction.\n\nFor the past three years, we have outperformed the “emerging” countries:\n\n\n\nAnd we have outperformed the “advanced” countries:\n\n\n\nBut in the last two years gains have been choppy. Notice how manufacturing growth slowed not only when Europe’s woes began to crimp confidence, but also when fiscal infighting dominated behavior in Washington.\n\n\n\nSo, two questions: How do we continue to outperform other nations? How do we reignite and sustain the manufacturing renaissance?\n\nMonday’s front-page article of the Wall Street Journal pointed to some of the sources of strength in U.S. manufacturing, citing my old friend Ernie Preeg (who used to supervise me in writing economic policy decision memoranda for President Carter—which means Ernie must be 110 years old by now, a miracle of science!) and the work done by Hal Sirkin and his colleagues at the Boston Consulting Group.\n\nThe article cited a critical factor influencing our destiny: the revolution occurring in oil and gas production. Thanks to a Houstonian named George Mitchell and other Schumpeterian practitioners who defied conventional wisdom and threw out the old and embraced the new, we have developed an abundance of natural gas and liquids production that are the stuff of production and the enablers of consumption. This is captured graphically here:\n\n\n\nThe Journal article also cited better relationships with unions and with workers in crafting flexible and innovative labor contracts, the rising cost of labor relative to productivity in China and the “world is our oyster” capacity for sales of exported U.S. manufactured goods, noting as examples the overseas sales of Hypertherm and Graco.\n\nWhat the Journal article failed to cite is a historically profound enabler: Cheap and abundant money made possible by the Federal Reserve. I promised Bill Simon I would not venture into monetary policy today, and I won’t. But I will say this: While there are many risks in the policy that the Fed has been pursuing (and God and anyone who has suffered through my speeches the past few years knows I fret about those risks), every manufacturer of goods in America has been given a great gift by your central bank—the lowest cost of money in 237 years, an extension of the roaring bond market rally that has now run 32 years, and a broad stock market rally that began in March of 2009 and has gone on to bust through all previous record highs.[2]\n\nLook at this chart of the three-decade-old bond market rally:\n\n\n\nOur manufacturers, like all businesses public and private—large, medium and small—have also been given more than abundant natural gas and other sources of energy for their operations: They have been given abundant, super-cheap monetary fuel needed to stoke up their production engines and expand their businesses.\n\nSo what is holding us back from bending the curve of historical manufacturing production that I first showed you and extending our recent superior performance on the manufacturing front?\n\nThe Journal article I just mentioned noted inhibiting factors such as a shortage of skilled workers and the draw of growing markets like China, India and Brazil for plant location. And of course there’s the slowdown in Europe and in some emerging markets. But the article skirted the most vexing and self-inflicted inhibitor of all: fiscal and regulatory policy of the gang that can’t shoot straight in Washington.\n\nI have spoken of this for years.\n\nThe Constitution unambiguously gives the Congress of the United States control of the fiscal purse strings. Yet all they have done under both Republican and Democrat presidents and the leadership of both parties in the upper and lower houses is spend and regulate with abandon.\n\nLet’s cut to the chase: The remaining obstacle to being the absolute best economy for manufacturers and other businesses, bar none, has been fiscal and regulatory policy that seems incapable of providing job-creating manufacturers and other businesses with tax, spending and regulatory incentives to take advantage of the cheap and abundant fuel the Fed has provided.\n\nAfter recovering most of the losses from the Great Recession, manufacturing growth has, on net, decelerated in the last two years. Ask any manufacturer what holds him or her back and they will tell you that they can’t operate in a fog of total uncertainty concerning how they will be taxed or how government spending will impact them or their customers directly. And as to asking their opinion of the impact of regulation on their businesses—from the Affordable Care Act to the thousands of other regulations enumerated in the Federal Register—don’t even go there, unless you delight in hearing profanities. I thought my college classmate Tom Stemberg, the founder of Staples, was remarkably constrained in his Wall Street Journal op-ed piece today as he pointed out that the 50,000 jobs he created from scratch might never have occurred under what he called today’s “blizzard of bureaucratic red tape.”[3]\n\nWe needn’t be condemned to the glue factory. American companies publicly held and private—large, medium and small—have taken advantage of the cheap and abundant money made available by the Fed’s very-accommodative monetary policy to create lean and muscular balance sheets. In response to the deep recession and the challenges of fiscal and regulatory uncertainty, they have rationalized their cost structures and ramped up productivity, leveraging IT, just-in-time inventory management and new production structures to the max. Their workers are more productive than ever.\n\nI believe American manufacturers today have the potential, far and away, to be the most efficient operators in the world. We have countless manufacturers in every sector of goods production and assembly that are the equivalent of the Secretariats, Man o’ Wars, Citations, Seabiscuits or any great thoroughbred that has ever graced the track. They just need to be let out of the starting gate.\n\nThat gate is controlled by Congress, working with the president. If they would just let ’em rip, we would have an economy that would take off. Instead of settling for being the “best-looking horse in the glue factory,” we can become the wonder-horse that outpaces the rest of the world, putting the American people back to work and renewing the unparalleled magnificence of American prosperity.\n\nHere is an image I want engraved in your minds. It is of Secretariat winning the Belmont Stakes by 31 lengths in 1973, leaving his competitors in the dust.\n\n\n\nI want our manufacturers to be Secretariats, beating out the rest of the world by a stunning margin. We can do it. We must do it. We must insist that Congress practice a little Schumpeterianism of its own: throwing out old, counterproductive fiscal and regulatory policies and ushering in new ones that unleash job creators from the starting gates. Then we will experience a “massive success.” And as Old Blue Eyes said, that massive success will be “the best revenge”—sweet revenge, indeed, on those who say that a true renaissance of American manufacturing is beyond our reach.\n\nThank you.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "August 5, 2013 Portland, Oregon\n\nThank you for that kind introduction, Dana [Bilyeu]. It is somehow comforting to speak to the National Association of State Retirement Administrators. For you, like my colleagues and me at the Federal Reserve, are faced with some very serious challenges. Angst, if not misery, does love company, especially in a beautiful setting such as Portland, Oregon, in August.\n\nYour anxious predicament—somehow untying the Gordian Knot of underfunded state retirement systems—is summarized for the lay reader in this week’s cover article in the Economist magazine.\n\n\n\n\n\nI will not attempt to advise you on how to manage the problems written about in that highly respected magazine, as I am sure there will be abundant discussion about funding gaps throughout this conference.\n\nOur predicament at the Federal Reserve is also widely written about. We too have a Gordian Knot to untangle. Like yours, it is anxiety inducing. Let me explain it to you, and in so doing, suggest that we share a common interest in the Fed succeeding in its mission.\n\nA Brief Backgrounder on the Fed\n\nFirst, a little background on the Federal Reserve. The Fed is the central bank of the United States. We operate under a license given to us by Congress one hundred years ago, a license that has been amended on occasion but has, for the most part, remained intact. The Fed provides the fuel for the nation’s economic engine: We print money, supplying the liquidity needed for job creators to put people to work and expand the wealth and output of the nation. And we are charged with regulating deposit-taking institutions to make sure they are transmitting monetary policy efficiently and operating prudently.\n\nWe have to be careful in deploying the fuel we create, for like all fuels, ours is combustible. Employed recklessly or without safeguard, it can lead to an explosion of inflation; if we are too miserly, we risk an implosion of deflation. We can spark a destructive outbreak of speculation or induce excessive risk aversion. We can enhance financial stability or exacerbate systemic instability.\n\nThere are 12 Federal Reserve Banks; together we operate the business of the Fed. We make loans to banks. We distribute Federal Reserve notes, more commonly known as “dollars,” to banks. (As an aside, if you look at a dollar bill you can see by the letter printed to the left of George Washington which Federal Reserve District it originally came from: Those with an “L” are the ones ordered from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing by the San Francisco Fed for Oregon and other states that make up the Twelfth Federal Reserve District; those with a “K” are from the Dallas Fed’s Eleventh District, covering principally Texas—these, of course, are the most coveted!) And the 12 Federal Reserve banks house the ground forces of bank examiners who supervise and regulate banks, bank holding companies, and savings and loan companies that lend and provide other services to Main Street.\n\nIt might interest you to know that none of the 12 Federal Reserve Bank presidents or their staff is a federal employee, though we work under the watchful eye of the Federal Reserve Board whose governors and staff are. I serve at the pleasure of a nine-person board of directors, chaired by the founder of Southwest Airlines, Herb Kelleher; I do not serve at the pleasure of the president of the United States, nor was I confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The seven members of the Board of Governors, led by Ben Bernanke, are federal employees who are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. This is the way the Federal Reserve was set up by Congress under President Wilson so as to balance power between the political exigencies of Washington and the financial and economic needs of Main Street.\n\nMaking Monetary Policy\n\nIn addition to doing the Main Street work of the Federal Reserve System, the presidents of the 12 Fed Banks sit down with the seven Governors of the Fed Board in a body called the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC) to decide the nation’s monetary policy. Together, we decide how much fuel to inject into America’s $16 trillion economic engine.\n\nJust as you and your trustees bear the fiduciary duty of properly managing and protecting the value of the pensions under your administration, we at the Fed are charged with the fiduciary duty of managing and protecting the value of our nation’s money supply. And just as your job is conditioned by decisions made by politicians outside of your control, so too is the Fed’s. Let me explain.\n\nBy law we are charged by Congress with protecting the purchasing power of money from the ravages of inflation or deflation, a directive we’ve been reasonably successful in satisfying over the past 20 years or so. If we create too much money, we spur inflation; if we create too little, deflation ensues. But Congress has also mandated that we conduct monetary policy so as to achieve full employment, a charge that we have the power to influence but cannot control. Much of the impetus for creating the conditions for full employment depends on how fiscal and regulatory actors incent job creators—where and how much to tax and spend and how businesses are regulated. These decisions are made by politicians the people elect, not by me and my colleagues at the nation’s central bank. As long as inflation is held at bay, the Federal Reserve can put the monetary pedal to the metal, but the vehicle of job creation will not move forward if the fiscal and regulatory authorities have their foot firmly on the brake.\n\nYears of Extraordinary Measures\n\nFor six of my eight years at the Fed, we have been working to bring the nation’s economy out of recession. The fiscal authorities have for the most part been AWOL during this time, having left the parking brake on during their absence. This has placed the onus on the Bernanke-led Federal Reserve. We have undertaken extraordinary measures, first to get the economy out of the emergency room after the financial system seizure of 2008-09, and more recently, to goose up the private sector to expand payrolls. Toward this end, the Fed cut interest rates to their lowest levels in the nation’s 237-year history by initially cutting the base rate for overnight interbank lending—the “fed funds rate”—to near zero, and then by purchasing massive amounts of U.S. Treasuries and bonds issued or backed by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises (obligations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac).\n\nThis later program is referred to as quantitative easing, or QE, by the public and as large-scale asset purchases, or LSAPs, internally at the Fed. As a result of LSAPs conducted over three stages of QE, the Fed’s System Open Market Account now holds $2 trillion of Treasury securities and $1.3 trillion of agency and mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Since last fall, when we initiated the third stage of QE, we have regularly been purchasing $45 billion a month of Treasuries and $40 billion a month in MBS, meanwhile reinvesting the proceeds from the paydowns of our mortgage-based investments. The result is that our balance sheet has ballooned to more than $3.5 trillion. That’s $3.5 trillion, or $11,300 for every man, woman and child residing in the United States.\n\nThe theoretical mechanics behind QE are straightforward: When the Fed buys Treasuries and MBS, it pays for them, putting money into the economy. A key intent of this unprecedented program was to drive down interest rates to such a degree that businesses would achieve a financial comfort level that would induce them to put back to work the millions of Americans that were laid off in the Great Recession. Thus far, only 76 percent of the jobs lost during 2008-09 have been clawed back in the more than three and a half years of modest to moderate payroll gains. This 76 percent figure does not include the 3 million or so jobs that would normally be created to absorb growth in the working-age population.\n\nMuscling the Yield Curve …\n\nThe efficacy of this effort is the subject of significant debate, even internally within the FOMC. Some who question the efficacy, including myself, note that the effect of our purchasing MBS and driving down mortgage rates has certainly assisted a robust recovery in housing, and with it, construction jobs and manufacturing and transportation of materials that go into homes. This was clear from reading the components of the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index released last Thursday, which showed the biggest one-month jump since 1996. Very liberal financing terms for automobiles that we have induced have coincided with an aging of the nation’s auto fleet to regenerate domestic auto sales to the 15.7 million units level. And the Fed’s muscling of the yield curve has brought what has been a 30-year-long bond market rally to a crescendo, as shown in the right-hand bottom corner of these slides.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe historically low interest rates engineered through the Fed’s QE programs have allowed American businesses to recapitalize their balance sheets. Any CEO or CFO worth their salt—running a company that is large, medium or small, whether publicly or privately owned—has by now taken advantage of this to restructure the liability side of their balance sheet. Publicly held companies have benefitted even more as lower rates have driven a raging bull market for stocks. As equity prices break new ground daily, the S&P 500 has soared 153 percent from its March 2009 trough.\n\nAnd yet job creation has been slow in coming. On this crucial front—the second leg of our dual mandate—we do not seem to have achieved much with the trillions of dollars we have poured into the economy through our three QE programs.\n\n… Is Accompanied by Costs\n\nCounteracting whatever benefits one can trace to the Fed’s unorthodox policies are some obvious costs. First, savers and others who rely on retirement monies invested in short-maturity fixed-income investments, such as bank CDs and Treasury bills, have seen their income evaporate while the rich and the quick, the big money players of Wall Street have become richer still.\n\nSecond, the standard return assumptions of 7.5 to 8 percent for retirement pools, as you well know, have been dashed (though I have always felt they were already calculated on an imaginary and politically convenient basis rather than a realistic one).\n\nThird, accompanying the Fed’s growing balance sheet we have seen a dramatic expansion in the monetary base—the sum of reserves and currency. Currently, much of the monetary base has piled up in the form of excess reserves of banks who have not found willing or able borrowers. Other forms of surplus cash are lying fallow on the balance sheets of businesses or being deployed in buying back shares and increasing dividend payouts so as to buttress company stock prices. A basic understanding of demand-pull inflation is “too much money chasing too few goods.” Thus, the excess, currently nondeployed money could prove the kindling of an inflationary conflagration unless the Fed is nimble in managing its effect as it works its way into the economy’s production and consumption of goods and services.\n\nA corollary of reining in this massive monetary stimulus in a timely manner is that financial markets may have become too accustomed to what some have depicted as a Fed “put.” Some have come to expect the Fed to keep the markets levitating indefinitely. This distorts the pricing of financial assets, encourages lazy analysis and can set the groundwork for serious misallocation of capital.\n\nThe Challenge of Untying the Monetary Gordian Knot\n\nThe challenge now facing the FOMC is that of deciding when to begin dialing back (or as the financial press is fond of reporting: “tapering”) the amount of additional security purchases. In his press conference following our June FOMC meeting, speaking on behalf of the Committee, Chairman Bernanke made clear the parameters for dialing back and eventually ending the QE program. Should the economy continue to improve along the lines then envisioned by Committee, the market could anticipate our slowing the rate of purchases later this year, with an eye toward curtailing new purchases as the unemployment rate broaches 7 percent and prospects for solid job gains remain promising.\n\nKindly note that this does not mean that the Committee would envision raising the shorter term fed funds rate simultaneously; indeed, the Committee has said it expects this pivotal rate to remain between 0 and ¼ percent at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5 percent, intermediate prospects for inflation are reasonable, and longer-term inflationary expectations remain well anchored.\n\nHaving stated this quite clearly, and with the unemployment rate having come down to 7.4 percent, I would say that the Committee is now closer to execution mode, pondering the right time to begin reducing its purchases, assuming there is no intervening reversal in economic momentum in coming months.\n\nThis is a delicate moment. The Fed has created a monetary Gordian Knot. You can see the developing complexity of that knot in this sequence of slides tracing the change in our portfolio structure with each phase of QE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhereas before, our portfolio consisted primarily of instantly tradable short-term Treasury paper, now we hold almost none; our portfolio consists primarily of longer-term Treasuries and MBS. Without delving into the various details and adjustments that could be made (such as considerations of assets readily available for purchase by the Fed), we now hold roughly 20 percent of the stock and continue to buy more than 25 percent of the gross issuance of Treasury notes and bonds. Further, we hold more than 25 percent of MBS outstanding and continue to take down more than 30 percent of gross new MBS issuance. Also, our current rate of MBS purchases far outpaces the net monthly supply of MBS.\n\nThe point is: We own a significant slice of these critical markets. This is, indeed, something of a Gordian Knot.\n\nThose of you familiar with the Gordian legend know there were two versions to it: One holds that Alexander the Great simply dispatched with the problem by slicing the intractable knot in half with his sword; the other posits that Alexander pulled the knot out of its pole pin, exposed the two ends of the cord and proceeded to untie it. According to the myth, the oracles then divined that he would go on to conquer the world.\n\nThere is no Alexander to simply slice the complex knot that we have created with our rounds of QE. Instead, when the right time comes, we must carefully remove the program's pole pin and gingerly unwind it so as not to prompt market havoc. For starters though, we need to stop building upon the knot. For this reason, I have advocated that we socialize the idea of the inevitability of our dialing back and eventually ending our LSAPs. In June, I argued for the Chairman to signal this possibility at his last press conference and at last week’s meeting suggested that we should gird our loins to make our first move this fall. We shall see if that recommendation obtains with the majority of the Committee.\n\nAs administrators of our states’ retirement funds, you have a vested interest in the Fed’s success. After all, the promises made to the good people who have worked for your states can only be kept if financial stability reigns, employment increases and economic growth improves. I believe we are capable of achieving these things, despite suggestions by some that we are locked into a secular trend of subpar growth; I believe that the U.S. is capable of significant economic growth going forward. But only if the nation’s fiscal authorities get their act together and develop policies that complement rather than retard the good that prudent monetary policy can achieve. The fiscal folks need to end the behavior parodied in this little video clip.\n\n\n\nOur elected officials’ traditional approach to fiscal matters has been about as cavalier as what you just saw. Given their dissolute behavior, against the background of the problems that beset Europe, the long-standing stagnation of Japan, and the challenges that face China and the emerging market economies that have prospered from supplying the materials needed for Chinese growth, I have often said that “the U.S. is the best-looking horse in the glue factory.” Weak as we have been, we are the best compared to all the rest. I have argued that the principal force holding us back from being the absolute best economy, bar none, has been fiscal management that seems incapable of providing job creators with tax, spending and regulatory incentives to take advantage of the cheap and abundant fuel the Fed has provided so that businesses can put the American people back to work.\n\nI have argued that whatever success we have achieved in clawing our way out of the “Great Recession” has been despite the fiscal and regulatory authorities. Ask any businessman or woman what holds him or her back and they will tell you it’s not monetary policy; it is that they can’t operate in a fog of total uncertainty concerning how they will be taxed or how government spending will impact them or their customers directly. And as to asking their opinion of the impact of regulation on their businesses, don’t even go there, unless you delight in hearing profanities.\n\nHorseshift!\n\nWe needn’t be condemned to the glue factory. As I said, American companies publicly held and private—large, medium and small—have taken advantage of the cheap and abundant money made available by the Fed’s hyper-accommodative monetary policy to create lean and muscular balance sheets. In response to the deep recession and the challenges of fiscal and regulatory uncertainty, they have rationalized their cost structures and ramped up productivity, leveraging IT, just-in-time inventory management and new production structures to the max. I believe American businesses today are, far and away, the most efficient operators in the world. We have countless businesses in every sector of goods and service production that are the equivalents of the Secretariats, Man o’ Wars, Citations, Seabiscuits or any great thoroughbred that has ever graced the track. They just need to be let out of the starting gate.\n\nThat gate is controlled by Congress, working with the president. If they would just let 'em rip, we would have an economy that would soar. We would experience what, tongue firmly but confidently in cheek, I would call “horseshift”: from being the stuff of an economic glue factory to becoming the wonder-horse that would outpace the rest of the world, putting the American people back to work and renewing the wonder of American prosperity. If you and your fellow citizens from whatever state you hail from insist upon it, it will be done.\n\n\n\nThank you. And now, I would be pleased to avoid answering any questions you might have.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "June 26, 2013 Washington, D.C.\n\nChairman Hensarling, Ranking Member Waters, and Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify at this hearing on “Examining How the Dodd–Frank Act Could Result in More Taxpayer-Funded Bailouts.”\n\nBefore I begin, I want to recognize the common goal that we all share—ending “too big to fail” (TBTF) and taxpayer-funded bailouts. However, as iconic patriot Patrick Henry said in one of his greatest speeches, “Different men often see the same subject in different lights.” I recognize and respect a difference of opinion on this critical issue of how to eliminate taxpayer-funded bailouts. But I trust that in the marketplace of ideas and after careful deliberation—such as this hearing—our democratic process will shine through and decisions will be made that are in the best interest of our country.\n\nIn the same speech, Patrick Henry also appealed to all perspectives to do right: “This is no time for ceremony,” he said, for it “…is one of awful moment to this country.”\n\nThe great patriot was, of course, addressing the injustice of perpetuating the rule of the British Crown. This morning, I want to address what I consider the injustice of perpetuating financial institutions that are so large, complex and opaque that they are seen as critical to the proper functioning of our economy and are therefore considered TBTF.\n\nI will argue that these institutions operate under a privileged status that exacts an unfair and nontransparent tax upon the American people and represents not only a threat to financial stability, but to the rule of law as well as principles of fair and open competition—hallmarks of the democratic capitalism that makes our country great.\n\nI will argue that the effort crafted by Congress to correct the problems of TBTF—known as the 2010 Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd–Frank)—is, despite its best intentions, ineffective, burdensome, imposes a prohibitive cost burden on the non-TBTF banking institutions and needs to be amended. It is an example of the triumph of hope over experience.\n\nAnd, lastly, I will argue that dealing with TBTF is a cause that should be embraced by Republicans, Democrats and Independents alike. For regardless of your ideological bent, there is no escaping the reality that TBTF banks’ bad decisions inflicted harm upon the American people in the excessive credit boom through 2007 and particularly during the “awful moment” of the 2008–09 crisis.[1] The American people will be grateful to whoever liberates them from the risk of a recurrence of taxpayer bailouts and the serious threat of another Great Depression.\n\nFederal Reserve convention requires that I issue a disclaimer here: As is our practice, I speak only for myself, not for others associated with our nation’s central bank. There are different views on this issue even within the Fed; like Patrick Henry’s co-patriots, we too “see the same subject in different lights.” In addition to Jeff Lacker, President of the Richmond Fed, who is here with us today, the chairman of the Fed, Ben Bernanke, and three other governors, Jeremy Stein, Daniel Tarullo and Jerome Powell, all good friends and men I greatly admire, have expressed different views than ours in Dallas about how to address the problem of TBTF. You should consider their views, as well as those of Mr. Hoenig and Ms. Bair who join Mr. Lacker and me on this panel.[2] Today, I’ll simply give you the views that have been thought through over several years by my colleagues and me at the Dallas Fed.\n\nWhat’s the Problem?\n\nLess than a dozen megabanks—a mere 0.2 percent of all banking organizations—control two-thirds of the assets in the U.S. banking industry. The concentration of assets has been ongoing for more than 30 years, but it picked up pace in the 1990s and greatly intensified during the 2008–09 financial crisis, when several failing giants were absorbed, with taxpayers’ support, by larger, presumably healthier ones.\n\nThe result is a lopsided financial system, and the episode we all experienced in 2008–09 is one we are still in the process of recovering from. None of us ever wish to experience another catastrophe such as occurred in fall 2008. Yet, given the well-intentioned but impracticable reforms forged in the crucible of the crisis, I believe the likelihood and severity of another crisis have risen rather than receded.\n\nHere are the facts: Today, we have about 5,500 banking organizations in the United States. Nearly each and every one of these bank holding companies represents no threat to the survival of our economic system. But less than a dozen of the largest and most complex banks are each capable—through a series of missteps by their management—of seriously damaging the vitality, resilience and prosperity that has personified the U.S. economy. Any of these megabanks, given their systemic footprint and interconnectedness with other large financial institutions, could threaten to bring down the economy, again. This 0.2 percent of banks, deemed candidates to be considered “too big to fail,” is treated differently from the other 99.8 percent and differently from other businesses (Figure 1).\n\n\n\nImplicit government policy has made these megabank institutions exempt from the normal processes of bankruptcy and creative destruction. TBTF is a euphemism for a financial institution so large, interconnected and/or complex that its functions are seen as critical and policymakers think its demise could substantially damage the financial system and economy if it were allowed to fail. Without fear of closure, these banks and their counterparties can take excessive risks. We regularly see this reported in the press: Megabanks are too often driven by a culture directed more toward the generation of revenue growth to inflate their share price, without sufficient regard to prudent risk management. Executives and investors capture the upside; the taxpayers bear the downside risk (although this is not measured in our federal budget).\n\nIn our capitalist economic system, when companies that experience difficulties fail, their business models are rationalized, streamlined and reorganized. The highly diverse economic engine of growth that is the United States has become robustly dynamic upon the currents of what the renowned economist Joseph Schumpeter termed “creative destruction”—a “reap what you sow,” free-market process of success and failure, innovation and obsolescence. Viable business models should be given the opportunity to compete and prosper on their own merits, while unattractive strategies should be allowed to fail. Subverting the ability to fail, on the taxpayers’ dime, is a perversion of American capitalism.\n\nAdvantages to being Too Big, Too Complex, Too Opaque\n\nThe playing field is tilted to the advantage of the megabanks that can raise capital more cheaply than their smaller competitors due to perceived taxpayer support. Studies, including those published by the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements, estimate this advantage to be as much as 1 percentage point, or some $50 billion to $100 billion annually for U.S. TBTF banks, during the period surrounding the financial crisis.[3] In a popular post by editors at Bloomberg, the 10 largest U.S. banks are estimated to enjoy an aggregate longer-term subsidy of $83 billion per year.[4]\n\nAndy Haldane, executive director for financial stability at the Bank of England, estimates the current implicit TBTF subsidy to be roughly $300 billion per year for the 29 global institutions identified as “systemically important.”[5]\n\nLarge banks and their allies have pushed back against these points, producing a flurry of counter-claims in recent months. My staff and I have reviewed these arguments and have found them to be assertions lacking merit.\n\nGiven this range of estimates, Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and David Vitter of Louisiana have asked the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to calculate just how much of a cost-of-funds advantage the big banks have over the mid-sized and smaller community banking organizations that make up the 99.8 percent that are not implicitly protected from failure.\n\nAs pointed out by Simon Johnson, the MIT economist and former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, all one has to do is ask people in the credit markets if they think lenders to the biggest banks have some degree of protection offered by the government, and you will hear a resounding “yes.”[6]\n\nAt the Dallas Fed, we believe that whatever the precise subsidy number is, it exists, it is significant and it encourages the biggest banking organizations, along with their many nonbank subsidiaries (investment firms, securities lenders, finance companies), to grow larger and riskier.\n\nThis entire arrangement is patently unfair. It makes for an uneven playing field, tilted to the advantage of Wall Street against Main Street, placing the financial system and the economy in constant jeopardy.\n\nThe Problem Magnified, Not Solved\n\nThe Dodd–Frank Act was a well-intentioned response to the problem. We respect its drafters and those who crafted it in an earnest attempt to address much needed reform in the financial services industry. However, its stated promise to end too big to fail rings hollow. Running 849 pages and with more than 9,000 pages of regulations written so far to implement it, Dodd–Frank is long on process and complexity but short on results. Consequently, nearly three years after Dodd–Frank was signed into law, very little positive reform has been implemented.\n\nRegulators cannot enforce rules that are not easily understood. Nor can they enforce these rules without creating armies of new supervisors. This venerable Committee on Financial Services aggregates information from the Federal Register that estimates the cumulative hours needed for the affected agencies, like the Fed, to fulfill new requirements called for by Dodd–Frank. This Committee presently estimates that it will take 24,180,856 hours each year to comply with new rules already finalized for implementation of the act.[7] And we have yet to complete the rulemaking process!\n\nI work every day with my colleagues at the Fed to craft the monetary conditions to help the economy create jobs. This is not the kind of job creation I would hope for.\n\nI doubt anyone seriously believes that an additional several thousand pages of regulations, on top of the nine thousand already written, will provide clarity, procedural focus and the proper incentives to end TBTF and to “Just Say No” to more government bailouts.\n\nComplex regulations create barriers to entry and encourage firms to morph into even more complex and opaque structures. Further, regulatory supervision, by definition, is always at least one step behind the actions taken by market participants. The more complex the rules, the more difficult it is to bridge the gap due to the complexities of financial markets. None of this is helpful for financial stability.\n\nBailout Concerns Linger\n\nBriefly, I believe the current legislative solution to ending TBTF has actually exacerbated the issue and potentially codified TBTF, rather than eliminated it.\n\nAs soon as a financial institution is designated “systemically important” as required under Title I of Dodd–Frank (and becomes known by the acronym “SIFI”), it is viewed by the market as being the first to be saved by the first responders in a financial crisis. In other words, these “SIFIs” occupy a privileged space in the financial system (one pundit referred to the acronym as meaning “Save If Failure Impending”). As a corollary, a banking customer has a disincentive to do business with smaller competitors, because a non-SIFI does not have an implied government funding lifeline. Even if a SIFI ends up funding itself with more equity capital than a smaller competitor, the choice remains for where you would like to hold important financial relationships: with an institution with a government backstop or one without? Thus, the playing field remains uneven; the advantages of size and perceived subsidy accrue to the behemoth banks that will continue to grow larger and become even more of a systemic risk. Dodd–Frank does not eliminate this perception and in many ways perpetuates it as reality.\n\nFurther, some have held out hope that a key provision of Title I requiring banking organizations to submit detailed plans for their orderly resolution in bankruptcy, without government assistance, will provide for a roadmap to avoid bailouts. However, these “living wills” are likely to prove futile in helping navigate a real-time “systemic” failure. Given the complexity and opacity of the TBTF institutions and the ability to move assets and liabilities across subsidiaries and affiliates (as well as off-balance sheet, including through huge and fast-moving derivative positions), a living will would likely be ineffective when it really mattered. I do not have much faith in the living will process to make any material difference in TBTF risks and behaviors—a bank would run out of liquidity (not capital) due to reputational risk quicker than management would work with regulators to execute a living will blueprint.\n\nAdding insult to injury, Title II of Dodd–Frank describes and designates the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) as the resolution mechanism to handle the disposal of a giant, systemically-disruptive financial enterprise. The three letters themselves evoke the deceptive doublespeak of an Orwellian nightmare. The “L,” which stands for liquidation, will in practice become a simulated restructuring, as would occur in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nIn reality, rather than fulfill Dodd–Frank’s promise of “no more taxpayer-funded bailouts,” the U.S. Treasury will likely provide, through the FDIC, debtor-in-possession financing to the failed companies’ artificially-kept-alive operating subsidiaries for up to five years, but perhaps longer. Under the single point of entry method, the operating subsidiaries remain protected as the holding company is restructured. So if a company does business with the operating subsidiaries, say, through derivatives transactions, then this company is even more confident that their counterparty is TBTF. Some officials refer to this procedure as a “liquidity provision” rather than a bailout. Call it whatever you wish, but this is taxpayer funding at far-below-market rates.\n\nAt the Dallas Fed, we would call this form of “liquidation” a nationalized financial institution. During the five-year resolution period, this nationalized institution does not have to pay any taxes of any kind to any government entity. To us, this looks, sounds, and tastes like a taxpayer bailout, just hidden behind different language. If it waddles like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck.\n\nMoreover, if the reorganized company cannot repay the Treasury for its debtor-in-possession financing, Title II suggests that the repayment should be clawed back via a special assessment on the company’s SIFI competitors. But that assessment is then written off as a tax-deductible business expense, thereby reducing revenue to the Treasury. This is a \"rob Peter to pay Paul\" chain of events, with the taxpayer playing the role of Peter. Although I have not seen the Congressional Budget Office run the numbers for the plausible scenarios, I suspect that the impact on our federal deficit and debt would be significant, not to mention the potential effects from the concomitant recession that would likely occur. This does not sound like a “no taxpayer-funded bailouts” solution. One form of explicit intervention appears to have been replaced by Title II of Dodd–Frank, a disguised form of taxpayer bailout.\n\nTitle II promotes and sustains an unnatural longevity for zombie financial institutions—and this is an acute issue in other financial systems, including parts of Europe today. Title II imposes a competitive disadvantage onto small- and medium-size financial institutions, and it does so for potentially several years at taxpayer expense. It is these smaller financial institutions that, by the way, provide the primary financial lifeline so vital to the small- and medium-size businesses in your Congressional districts that, in turn, provide the bulk of innovation and job creation in the United States.[8]\n\nThis Committee’s Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations held a hearing on May 15, 2013, in this very room that focused on Title II in great detail. The four witnesses who testified that day gave a very informative and expert critique of the shortcomings of Title II, and I respectfully refer you to that hearing.[9]\n\nA Simple Proposal\n\nWhere does the current reform effort leave us and how should we forge a path forward? Despite the plethora of new rules and regulations created by Dodd–Frank, market discipline is still lacking for the largest financial institutions, as it was during the last crisis. Why should a prospective purchaser of bank debt or other type of counterparty practice due diligence if, in the end, regardless of new layers of regulation and oversight, it is widely perceived that the issuing institution and its subsidiaries will not be allowed to fail? There is a great deal of moral hazard at all levels of decision-making in our current financial system. We must change this status quo.\n\nThe return of marketplace discipline and effective due diligence of banking behemoths is long overdue. My colleagues and I at the Dallas Fed offer a modest proposal to that end, with a goal of leveling the playing field for all.\n\nHere is a simple graphic of the basic organizational structure of a typical financial holding company (Figure 2). Note the highlighted commercial bank operation within that structure. To begin with, we would roll back the federal safety net—deposit insurance and the Federal Reserve’s discount window—to where it was always intended to be, that is, to traditional commercial bank deposit and lending intermediation and payment system functions.[10] Thus, the safety net would only be available to traditional commercial banks and not to the nonbank affiliates of bank holding companies or the parent companies themselves. This is how the law needs to be applied, even in times of crisis.[11]\n\n\n\nSecond, customers, creditors and counterparties of all nonbank affiliates and the parent holding companies would sign a simple, legally binding, unambiguous disclosure acknowledging and accepting that there is no government guarantee—ever—backstopping their investment (Figure 3). They are on their own, and they know it. A similar disclaimer would apply to banks’ deposits outside the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) protection limit and other unsecured debts.\n\n\n\nKnowing where the federal government guarantees begin and end would properly realign incentives and reinvigorate a degree of creditor discipline that has been dormant at large, complex financial institutions for far too long.\n\nThird, we recommend that the largest financial holding companies be restructured so that every one of their corporate entities is subject to a speedy bankruptcy process, and in the case of the banking entities themselves, that they become an appropriate size, complexity and geographic footprint that is “too small to save.”[12] Addressing institutional size is vital to maintaining a credible threat of failure, thereby providing a convincing case that policy has truly changed. This step gets both bank incentives and structure right, neither of which is accomplished by Dodd–Frank.\n\nOur third step would provide a more level playing field with reduced regulatory costs for all competitors, encourage greater innovation by all members of the banking industry and minimize the downside consequences to the economy of megabank failures. The downsized, formerly too-big-to-fail banks would then be small and simple enough (just like the other 99.8 percent) that, with adequate planning, the FDIC could close and then reopen the bank in short order with new management and new private-sector ownership. “Closed on Friday and reopened on Monday” is the customary process administered by the FDIC that we would like to see applicable for all depository financial institutions.\n\nNo bank would remain so significant and interconnected to the financial system that its demise would spell the unraveling of the financial system. In these new circumstances, all banks that warranted closure would fail the old fashioned way; they would be gone, with their stockholders’ equity written down to zero, their bondholders saddled with haircuts and their insured depositors left unharmed.\n\nWhat’s The Way Forward?\n\nThe aim of our three-step proposal is simple: All banks would be subject to regulatory oversight that fits its business model—and most important, all banks would be subject to the market discipline exercised by owners and creditors. Given this more explicit treatment of creditors of regulated commercial banks, creditors of unregulated shadow banks should begin to understand that government guarantees don’t apply to their transactions with the affiliates of regulated commercial banks nor with unregulated financial companies that offer similar products and services. Market discipline could then begin to reinforce and even somewhat replace regulatory discipline.\n\nSome argue that these three steps are already at work within the current regulatory and legal framework. Others cautiously warn that we should wait to see how all of the rules and regulations of Dodd–Frank are implemented before we attempt any improvements. Both perspectives might underappreciate the urgency we feel to correct the current imbalance and perversion of capitalism before the next crisis, not after.\n\nArguments to “give Dodd–Frank a chance” or to simply address TBTF with higher capital requirements (and not complementary structural changes) fall short of necessary action. Living wills and higher capital requirements are potentially very helpful tools but are not sufficient to ensure the survival of a company, and they will not eliminate massive losses that can choke off liquidity and disrupt financial markets and the economy.\n\nBanks are levered institutions and are vulnerable given that they are usually levered with short-term debt like deposits and repo-like funding vehicles. Thus, capital helps to maintain confidence that the institution can sustain some losses and still remain open for business tomorrow. But once investors and creditors begin to fear that losses have been understated or forthcoming at that institution or similar institutions, confidence begins to rapidly diminish, and almost no amount of capital is sufficient to forestall a collapse of confidence and a liquidity crisis. When confidence begins to wane, liquidity dries up quickly. And the plunge in confidence is contagious, often having little to do with the underlying situation of each company. That’s where the lender of last resort function of the Federal Reserve comes into play—the central bank lends to solvent companies, those with positive capital and good collateral. But such capital is only a small element in saving a company from extinction. Confidence matters even more.\n\nWithin the category of capital, it is loss-absorbing capital that buttresses confidence the most. Equity capital is the first to absorb losses; hence, it is the most expensive capital to raise. Debt doesn’t absorb losses except in bankruptcy, at which point the company is dead. Risk-weighted capital is somewhat meaningless—and sometimes deeply misleading—in the context of loss absorbency; any asset that incurs losses must be written off against equity capital, whether the loss was in business loans, mortgage loans, municipal bonds or agency debt. If losses thin out the capital cushion to the point of undermining confidence, the future viability of the company slips. Nobody knows the magic capital ratio that will prevent a loss of confidence, and I do not believe regulators will suddenly become better equipped to set higher magical ratios in the future for the largest, most politically-connected banking institutions. Capital is necessary for viability (nonfailure), and I support higher capital requirements (particularly for any institution that could become of systemic importance), but it is not sufficient.\n\nWe concede that our proposal doesn’t have all the answers either. It would not eliminate financial crises—that would be an impossible or even foolish goal—but it should reduce their frequency and severity. Nor will it alter the human DNA of those who serve as “first responders” during the next crisis. Our proposal should make the magnitude of the problems regulators face, and the tasks they need to perform, far more manageable. Under our plan, supervisory agencies would oversee several thousand community banks, a few hundred moderate-size banks (by today’s standards) and no megabanks. The nonbank and shadow bank components of a large financial holding company would still operate but without subsidy and access to the safety net and with long-overdue market discipline imposed by at-risk creditors.\n\nThere will always be some banks that are larger than the rest, and consequently, there will be temptation for regulators to label the “biggest few” as systemically important. The fluctuating nature of human resolve and political fortitude, as well as the problem of “regulatory capture,” has been present in U.S. bank policy at least since the intervention/bailout of Continental Illinois and its creditors in 1984. Our proposal may not prohibit regulators from intervening to support the unsecured creditors of a failing banking institution. But our proposal reduces the dimensions of the problem—asset size and systemic interconnectedness—by an order of magnitude and thereby should diminish the tendency to intervene out of fear of unknown systemic risks. Our plan would dramatically reduce the costs of nonintervention.\n\nThe elimination of TBTF along the lines we have proposed will not, as the megabanks suggest, diminish our nation’s competitive advantage in global financial markets. If anything, our proposal may help drive innovation in our financial system by leveling the playing field.\n\nThe former safety net implicitly covered too much of a selective part of the credit intermediation system, promoting perverse risk-taking incentives. We believe that had the Dallas Fed plan I have articulated today been in place a decade ago, it would have altered the insidious behaviors that contributed to the crisis, avoiding the bailouts and their aftermath, the cost of which our nation’s citizens will endure for years to come.[13] We believe that had our plan helped guide the restructuring of the banking and financial services industry before the crisis began, neither Citigroup, Bank of America, nor others would have been positioned to receive hundreds of billions of dollars of extraordinary government assistance; the parts of these companies that got into trouble would have been sold off, closed or run through a standard bankruptcy process. The taxpayers would never have been involved.\n\nThe same could be said of Bear Stearns; the first shadow bank to require government assistance back in March 2008 would have been governed by market discipline and unable to call upon giant banking institutions to find an over-the-weekend, government-assisted acquisition because there would have been no megabanks to invite to the table. Further, the more disciplined financial marketplace that would result from the adoption of our proposal likely would have helped prevent a concentration of risks and imbalances of the magnitude that occurred at AIG. This is the ultimate test and counterfactual thought experiment for any proposal to end TBTF. The GAO and others estimate that the cost of the financial crisis, measured in lost consumption and jobs, could exceed $14 trillion, or roughly one whole year of U.S. output.[14]\n\nWe do not think Dodd–Frank would have averted the 2008–09 financial crisis and its horrendous costs and consequences had the act been in place and implemented in the years before the crisis began. Were we to have another crisis today, we believe that the cost would be even greater because, in effect, rather than in theory, Dodd–Frank entrenches and perpetuates TBTF banks that are now even bigger than they were before.\n\nAn Appeal for Action\n\nIn my introduction, I referred to Patrick Henry. In the speech I quoted, he went on to say, “It is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope. We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the song of that siren till she transforms us.” I implore the members of this important committee and the Congress to not succumb merely to the illusion of hope. Don’t listen to the siren song of the megabanks and their lobbyists. Take action to deal with the unfair advantages that these institutions enjoy. They will spend millions of dollars to try to perpetuate their brand of crony capitalism. Resisting their entreaties is the right thing to do. Leveling the playing field is a just cause for 99.8 percent of American banks and for all Americans.\n\nThe potential taxpayer burden of dealing with TBTF institutions might be addressed by a still-growing army of bank supervisory personnel trying to enforce the rigid, complex and probably easy-to-evade rules of Dodd–Frank. However, this would be oversight without the benefit of supplemental reinforcement from market discipline and increased due diligence.\n\nIn March of this year, the Dallas Fed released an annual report on “Vanquishing Too Big to Fail.” [15] The contents of this report explored the merits of community banks, the adverse effects of current reform efforts and the urgency of reasserting market discipline for all institutions—large and small—to compete on a more level playing field. Accompanying these essays is a series of responses to the questions and criticisms we have received about our proposal, including those raised by proponents for the megabanks. This “Q&A with Richard Fisher on TBTF” can be found at www.dallasfed.org/microsites/fed/annual/2012/ar12c/index.cfm.\n\nUnfortunately, a subsidy once given is nearly impossible to take away. Overcoming entrenched oligopoly forces, in combination with customer inertia, may require government-sanctioned reorganization and restructuring of the TBTF firms in order to accelerate the imposition of effective market discipline.\n\nWe advocate using as little government intervention and statutory modification as possible to restructure the largest institutions to a size that is effectively disciplined by both market and regulatory forces—so that every corporate entity is subject to a speedy bankruptcy process and every banking entity is “too small to save.”\nThis would underscore to customers and creditors that a credible regime shift has taken place, that all banking organizations are without subsidy and are governed by the market discipline of creditors at risk of loss, and that the reign of TBTF policies has truly ended.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "January 16, 2013 Toronto\n\nThank you, Hugh (MacKinnon). I am honored to speak to this annual directors’ dinner of the C.D. Howe Institute and on the second day of Stephen Poloz becoming the governor of the Bank of Canada. Evan Siddall, his special adviser, is here tonight to keep an eye on me!\n\nThank You, Canada\n\nBefore getting to my formal remarks, I want to say something about Canada that has nothing to do with monetary policy. On Sept. 11, 2001, I was on a flight, returning from the celebration of the opening of the Jewish Museum in Berlin two days earlier.\n\nOn the morning of that fateful day, my flight was en route to New York City when we were suddenly redirected to Toronto. We had been prevented from landing in New York, the pilot announced, because of “severe headwinds.” We were told nothing more. After landing and deplaning at Pearson and going through an extensive screening process, we were ushered into a briefing room and only then learned what little was known at the time of the horrors that had occurred. Your government and our consular officials said that we were to remain in Toronto until order in America was restored, adding they were confident we would be well cared for as guests of a very compassionate Canada.\n\nSure enough, when we exited the airport, we found a line of cars driven by private citizens who had spontaneously come to the airport to take any and all of their American brethren into their homes and care for us while we waited anxiously to learn more of what had happened and why.\n\nFrom the home of my Canadian host, I somehow managed to get through by cell phone routed through Dallas to my wife, Nancy. She was hiding with our two youngest children in the basement of our house in Washington, D.C. With the passage of time, it is easy to forget how chaotic and frightful that day was. It was unclear if all of Washington was under attack; rumors abounded that the Capitol and the White House were targeted. Our son had seen the images from Flight 77’s crash into the Pentagon and had run home from school with his frightened little sister in tow.\n\nI wanted to make sure my wife and children were safe. She reported they were and then asked if I was. I remember saying, “I am safe in the hands of our Canadian brothers and sisters.”\n\nEvery chance I get, I thank Canadians for the caring and unconditional friendship you and your countrymen showed the United States on that infamous day. For the rest of my life, Canada will hold a special place in my heart.\n\nIndeed, I love this country so much that I have even found it possible to forgive Sheila Copps for forcing me to listen to endless re-loops of songs by Gordon Lightfoot when I was deputy U.S. trade rep and negotiated with her during her reign as minister of Canadian heritage![1]\n\nThe Predicament of the U.S. Economy: Growth …\n\nNow, on to the status of the U.S. economy and monetary policy—of special interest to you because we account for three-quarters of Canada’s goods exports and a substantial amount of Canadian direct and portfolio investment.\n\nHere is a handy graphic we use at the Dallas Fed as a simple indicator of the current predicament of the U.S. economy:\n\n\n\nAs shown, the most recent data for real gross domestic product (GDP) and inflation—as measured by the Trimmed Mean Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index, the Dallas Fed’s preferred indicator—have both increased less than 2 percent year over year after first-quarter GDP growth was revised to 2.4 percent and the 12-month run rate for Trimmed Mean PCE inflation came in at 1.3 percent at the end of April.\n\nThe dashboard indicates that the U.S. economy is cruising along at what appears to be near-stall speed—note the “Engine stall” red warning light. The unemployment rate gauge is not red because it declined to 7.5 percent in April. As indicated by the odometer box, we have traveled some distance in job creation, even though we have not seen the job creation we might have hoped for in a typical recovery: 70.4 percent of jobs lost in the recent recession have been recovered, up from about 50 percent only a year ago.\n\nThe warning light for the yield curve should be pink, if not yet red, for, if anything, it is robust to the point of possibly becoming problematic in giving rise to speculative impulses. Despite the most recent widening, junk-bond spreads are below 5 percent, as shown; nominal yields for even the lowest-grade bonds (CCC-rated credit that is one notch above default) have fallen to below 7 percent from double digits only a year ago. This is of interest because, according to Dealogic, we have had $187 billion of junk bonds issued in the U.S. so far this year, a record.[2] Further, covenant-light lending is on a tear. And unless you’ve been living on another planet, you know we have experienced a roaring bull market for equities. Thus the “oil lamp,” shown in the lower left corner of the dashboard, depicts that the Fed has supplied plenty of lubrication for the engine of job creation.\n\nOver the four years since the recession ended in June 2009, GDP growth has averaged just 2.1 percent, hewing to a narrow year-over-year range of 1.5 to 2.8 percent. It is noteworthy that the fraternity of U.S. professional economic forecasters has been consistently disappointed: Forecasts made at the beginning of 2010, 2011 and 2012 all overpredicted growth. At the onset of this year, the median projection of professional forecasters called for 2.4 percent GDP growth for all of 2013, and that, too, has been challenged by first-quarter data that came in below expectations, raising fears of “déjà vu all over again.”\n\nHowever, the April jobs report, revisions of previous jobs data, and reports concerning consumer behavior in May have put some spring back in economists’ steps despite the malaise in manufacturing that has persisted for some time (long before yesterday’s Institute for Supply Management manufacturing numbers were released). Initial claims for unemployment insurance are now back on a downward trend, retreating toward prerecession levels, and recent retail sales numbers and indicators of consumer activity have surprised to the upside. This would appear to indicate that consumers may have digested delayed tax rebates and the increase in payroll taxes, and are relishing the benefits of lower gasoline, food and other prices. So the recovery presently appears to be strong enough to propel hopes that consumption will help employment growth gradually improve over the long term.\n\nI know audiences like this always want to be given some forecast of economic growth, especially by someone who they assume has some inside knowledge. I’ll stick my neck out in a moment, after a brief discourse on where we are on the inflation front. But I ask that you treat any forecast from any source with what I like to call “Arrow’s Caveat.”\n\nDuring World War II, future Nobel laureate Ken Arrow served as a weather officer in the Army Air Corps. He and his team were charged with producing month-ahead weather forecasts. Being a disciplined analyst, Arrow reviewed the record of his predictions and, sure enough, confirmed statistically that the corps’ forecasts were no more accurate than random rolls of dice. He asked to be relieved of this futile duty. Arrow’s recollection of the response from on high was priceless: “The commanding general is well aware that the forecasts are no good. However, he needs them for planning purposes.”\n\n… and the Outlook for Price Stability\n\nThe Fed’s most sacred duty is to see to the maintenance of price stability. Today, inflation is benign. With a jobless rate still well north of 7 percent, a high rate of underemployment, labor compensation rising at less than 2 percent per year, an outlook for abundant food crops and expanding energy resources, and near-record profit margins among operating businesses, there is little likelihood of cost–push pressures in 2013. Slower growth around the globe is putting the damper on demand–pull inflation. Provided the public remains confident in the Fed’s commitment to price stability, anchored by the stated 2 percent long-term target of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the chances of inflation rearing its ugly head in 2013 are presently extremely low. I am sticking my neck out for the next six months!\n\nIndeed, the latest Trimmed Mean PCE inflation calculation done by the Dallas Fed for April posted a negative reading—minus 0.1 percent—for the first time since the raw data became available in 1977, with 44 percent of the basket of 178 components measured declining in price.[3] This is all subject to revision, but the drift is that the underlying inflation rate as we see it at the Dallas Fed, as mentioned, is running at a pace of 1.3 percent.\n\nThe Efficacy of Current Monetary Policy\n\nAs a hawk in the aviary of policymakers, I have for some years now said that the issue of the moment is not a meaningful threat to price stability. The issue is job creation. And the questions I keep raising at FOMC meetings regard our limited ability to affect it with our über-accommodative monetary policy.\n\nWith the Arrow Caveat in mind, my staff and I think there is a better-than-even chance that the present GDP growth consensus forecast of 2.4 percent by professional economists may be underestimating the underlying pace of growth. The housing market is in resurgence, contributing significant impetus to the economy. The Fed’s senior loan officer survey indicates that commercial banks are becoming more accommodative lenders, albeit remaining cautious. The snapback in housing and the harnessing of cheap and abundant money by the business sector have made for more manageable financial obligations. State and local governments, not just in my home power-state of Texas but elsewhere in the nation, are on a better financial footing and no longer appear to be a major drag on growth. New technologies are providing for cheaper and more abundant energy. Consumers continue consuming, an important component that represents 71 percent of the U.S. economy (compared with Canadian consumption accounting for 54 percent of national output). Monetary policy has helped drive interest rates to historic lows and equity markets to historic highs; if anything, as noted, it may be giving rise to excessive speculation and risk taking. In addition to the pricing of CCC debt and the surge in low-covenant lending, margin debt is climbing rapidly.\n\nEven if we at the Dallas Fed are right and the overall outlook for the economy is better than the current dashboard or the conventional prognostications of economists, there exists a formidable brake on growth. It was referred to point-blank in the last statement issued by the FOMC: “…fiscal policy is restraining economic growth.”[4]\n\nFiscal policy is inhibiting the transmission of monetary policy into robust job creation.\n\nAs this is an after-dinner speech and a little levity is always helpful in making a point at this time of night, here is my favorite spoof on the historical behavior of fiscal policy makers in Washington, D.C.:\n\n\n\nThis would be funny if it were not so sad. The propensity of members of Congress has been to spend in excess of revenues to give pleasure to their constituents and garner their affection. They just didn’t get the memo that Jefferson wrote to Madison over two centuries ago: “We are ruined, Sir, if we do not overrule the principles that ‘the more we owe, the more prosperous we shall be,’ [and] ‘that a public debt furnishes the means of enterprise.’”[5] The good news is that, some 200-plus years later, the memo seems to have finally been received; there are numerous plans to rein in Congress’ spendthrift ways, and there have been improvements that have brightened the short-term outlook for the level of federal debt.[6] But, as yet, there has been little more than passive action.\n\nUntil the Congress and the president provide a clear road map to restoring fiscal rectitude, economic growth will continue to be impeded by undue uncertainty about future tax rates, future government purchases, future retiree benefits and all manner of factors that prevent the U.S. from achieving its long-run potential. Meanwhile, the divisive nature and petty posturing of those who must determine the fiscal path of the nation are further undermining confidence, hindering the upward momentum needed for a full recovery and limiting the effectiveness of monetary policy.\n\nHere is the rub: Even if the arguments of those who wish for greater fiscal stimulus prevail, expansion in government purchases will have reduced effectiveness if it is thought that those purchases will be financed with higher future marginal tax rates, or the broadest tax of all, higher inflation. If you are an operating business, you have to discount this risk before adding significantly to payrolls and before undertaking capital expansion. In a similar vein, you need to consider how the opposite approach of cutting government expenditures might impact your top line if the cuts are in areas that affect the markets you sell into. Add to that the enormous uncertainty about how health care reform will impact your cost structure. And add to that the fact that community bankers—providers of the lifeblood of loans to small businesses, which are the impetus for new job creation and economic rejuvenation—are hamstrung by burdensome regulations and fees imposed in response to the misbehavior of their too-big-to-fail brethren. If you consider the economy from this perspective, you can see where brakes of the government’s own making are being applied, impeding the realization of our growth potential.\n\nDecision-making under conditions of uncertainty is always a challenge for businesses; decision-making in a thick fog of uncertainty is well-nigh impossible. It negates the power of hyperaccommodative monetary policy to propel our economic vessel forward. The restraining influence of rudderless fiscal policy is readily seen in the piling up of excess reserves on the balance sheets of banks and in the coffers of operating businesses.\n\nI argue that the Fed has no hope of moving the economy to full employment, despite having pulled out all the stops on the monetary front, unless our fiscal authorities get their act together. Those economic agents with the wherewithal to expand payrolls and put the American people back to work must have confidence that our fiscal authorities and regulation makers—the legislative and the executive—will reorganize the tax code, spending habits and the regulatory regime so that the cheap and abundant money we at the Fed have made available to invest in job-creating capital expansion in the United States is put to use. Until then, I argue that the Fed is, at best, pushing on a string and, at worst, building up kindling for speculation and, eventually, a massive shipboard fire of inflation.\n\nI note that in his speech of last Wednesday to the Economic Club of New York, former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker highlighted that managing the supply of money and liquidity “to accommodate misguided fiscal policies, to deal with structural imbalances, [or] to square continuously the hypothetical circles of stability, growth and full employment” was a risky proposition for the Federal Reserve and warned that in attempting to do so, the Fed “will inevitably fall short.” He even referenced “pushing on a string.” And he added that, “The risks of encouraging speculative distortions and the inflationary potential—[note the word “potential,” not “present instance”]—of the current approach plainly deserve attention.” I am in complete agreement with Mr. Volcker. I urge you to read his speech if you wish to understand my personal concerns about the present course of monetary policy.[7]\n\nA Shakespearean Scenario\n\nOnly time will reveal the efficacy of current policy and whether the risks that I and more experienced observers like Paul Volcker fret over are as substantial as we surmise, or whether we have made much ado about nothing.\n\nIf the Fed’s monetary policy were the stuff of Shakespearean drama with a prototypical five acts, one might say we are in the last scene of the third act of a play titled “The Grand Experiment in Modern Monetarism.” We will not know until the next two acts whether the play will end felicitously or otherwise.\n\nHere is the CliffsNotes summary of the play thus far: The play opened with the great financial tempest of 2008–09, during which it appeared the ship of the mighty American economy would founder. A humble, once unassuming but suddenly daring captain named Ben Bernanke took firm control of the nation’s monetary helm in Act II, contriving innovative ways to keep the economy afloat by jury-rigging monetary policy and adopting radical maneuvers. These efforts succeeded in steering the ship of the economy away from the shoals of depression and deflation and into more tranquil waters.[8]\n\nAct III began with a recovering economy heading on a more promising course. But the headway being made was substandard, hindered by the flotsam and jetsam of fiscal incompetence and rising fears of a new storm brewing in Europe. In an effort to propel the economy forward at a better clip, the FOMC commanded that unprecedented amounts of monetary fuel be provisioned for the financial system through large-scale asset purchases, colloquially known as QE2 and 3. These purchases pumped almost $1 trillion into the stores of reserves of banks. As yet, however, the banks have for the most part not shoveled that fuel into their boilers, lending only a small fraction of it to job-creating businesses and hoarding the remainder. Other members of the financial fleet, however, have been heartened by the turn of events, especially those who finance themselves through the issuance of stocks and bonds rather than through bank loans. Yet they, too, have been reluctant to transform their renewed means into robust job creation. Thus, the economy remains weaker than desired, and the ship of the economy is making less-than-desired headway.\n\nThe plot now thickens. Act IV, just beginning, will involve the drama of introspection, with the FOMC evaluating the utility of its navigational tactics, and, perhaps, fine-tuning them, if not altering the course.\n\nNot until the final act will we know whether we have achieved the felicitous outcome of arriving at the desired port of an economy that grows sufficiently to bring about full employment without giving rise to inflation. With Shakespeare, the most pleasant plays typically end in marriage. The happy outcome to our economic predicament would entail a coupling of sensible fiscal policy with prudent monetary policy, carrying the American economy to new horizons, allowing the Fed to emerge a hero.\n\nOne can envision less-pleasant outcomes, however, some of them tragic. If the fiscal authorities—Congress and the president—are unable to provide tax, spending and regulatory incentives for job creators to use the cheap and abundant capital the FOMC has made available, the economy might remain endlessly becalmed. Should the FOMC try to compensate for fiscal authorities’ inability to act by provisioning still more monetary fuel, it may risk an explosion of speculative excess, or worse: an eventual inflationary conflagration, the debasement of money and the ruination of our economy and lifestyle. Should this prove the outcome, the Fed will be transmogrified from hero to villain.\n\nTo thicken the plot further, there is the uncertainty about whether command of the Fed will change hands during Act IV or V—whether the skipper who set us on the present course will stay (which I have personally advocated in other speeches) or be replaced by someone who wishes to remain on the course he set or change it. And whether in commissioning a new captain of the Fed’s fleet, if that is what the playwright decides, the Congress will introduce new dramatic themes that might steer the plot in new directions. Even now, the chorus is chanting about a Sound Dollar Act and other initiatives from behind the curtain.\n\nAll of which means that despite the mighty efforts of Captain Bernanke and his crew, present company included, we do not know how this play will end. Will “The Grand Experiment” prove an inspiring history, a tragedy or simply a comedy of errors? We will not know for some time. We will not know until the curtain drops on Act V.\n\nI am tempted to end with a slightly adapted, trite reminder that “All the world’s economy is a stage and we policymakers are merely players upon it,” but I shan’t. Instead I’ll end by thanking you for listening to me and, again, expressing my gratitude for the solidarity you and your fellow Canadians have shown the United States through thick and thin.\n\nAnd now, Hugh, time and patience permitting, I would be happy to avoid answering any questions you and your colleagues might have.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "May 16, 2013 Houston, TX\n\nThank you, Ken (Simonson). I am delighted that the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) has chosen the Dallas Fed’s Houston Branch as the venue for this meeting on the oil and gas boom as a possible engine for “Reigniting the Economy.” As you will shortly hear from my Dallas Fed colleague, Mine Yücel; my wise old colleague from my days at Treasury in the 1970s, Phil Verleger; the incoming chairman of our San Antonio Branch, Curt Anastasio; and others, this is an intriguing proposition. The technical and entrepreneurial genius of Houston and Texas is playing a key role in unlocking our nation’s energy potential. Indeed, there are many here in Texas and abroad—in places as distant as Illinois, Michigan and New York—who argue that reigniting their local economies and the nation’s economy calls for more “Texification,” above and beyond the frontiers of energy.\n\nBut I am not here today to discuss oil and gas or engage in “Texas brag.” I have been asked to provide a broader perspective on the nation’s economic and monetary policy.\n\nCurrent Predicament of Monetary Policy: A Grand Experiment\n\nI’ll begin with a summary of the current predicament of monetary policy.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has undertaken a grand experiment to reignite the economy through unprecedented monetary accommodation. We cut to zero the base rate that anchors the yield curve and have pursued a policy aimed at driving rates throughout the curve to historic lows by buying Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Our portfolio totals about $3 trillion, which we have recently been expanding at a rate of $85 billion per month.\n\nHere is a picture of the domestic securities of the current System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio. [1]\n\n\n\nThe sea change in the balance sheet in recent years is immediately visible: In sharp contrast to the past, we now hold almost no Treasury notes of less than three years’ duration—the dark blue space. We have purchased in the secondary markets some $1.7 trillion in longer-term Treasuries—the light blue area—and, as denoted by the green, more than $1.1 trillion of securities backed by the Federal National Mortgage Association (commonly known as Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (Freddie Mac) and the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae). We live in an age of big numbers when I can say, “Ignore the purple space, for it is only $70 billion in remaining Fannie and Freddie debentures, aka ‘agency debt.’” Before the crisis, when we didn’t have any agency debt, $70 billion would have represented 8 percent of our balance sheet.\n\nAs to the duration of these purchases, here is a picture from year-end 2012:\n\n\n\nIncluding securities purchased since then, the total SOMA portfolio has an average duration of seven years, with Treasury securities at eight years and MBS having risen to four years.\n\nAccording to dealers’ forecasts at year-end and as of March, the probability distribution of the expected size of the SOMA portfolio is as follows:\n\n\n\nSo, you now have a snapshot of where we are. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has cut the short-term rate to zero. Being “zero bound,” we instructed our traders to embark on a buying spree of Treasuries and MBS, and they have done so, ballooning our balance sheet from its precrisis level of less than $900 billion to about $3.3 trillion. Presently, the committee is adding to its holdings at a rate of $85 billion in longer-term securities each month, in addition to reinvesting principal payments from holdings of agency MBS and agency debt securities into agency MBS. And the predominant sentiment of the “market,” as measured by our dealer surveys, presently posits that we will build our holdings further, to between $3.5 trillion and possibly $5 trillion by the end of 2014.\n\nThe Economy’s Dashboard\n\nAs to the status of the economy, here is the dashboard our Research Director (and former NABE President) Harvey Rosenblum uses as a simple graphic to describe the current economic predicament:\n\n\n\nYou will note that the data compiled at the end of the first quarter on real gross domestic product (GDP) growth and inflation—as measured by the Trimmed Mean Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Index, the Dallas Fed’s preferred indicator—show that both increased less than 2 percent year over year. The dashboard also indicates that at quarter’s end, we were cruising along at near stall speed—note the “Engine stall” red warning light. The unemployment-rate gauge is not red because it declined to 7.5 percent in April. And, as indicated by the odometer box, we have traveled some distance in job creation, even though we have not seen the job creation we might have hoped for in a typical recovery: 70.4 percent of jobs lost in the recent recession have been recovered, up from about 50 percent only a year ago. The indicator for the yield curve, if anything, is robust. Junk-bond spreads are below 5 percent; nominal yields for even the lowest-grade bonds (CCC-rated credit that is one notch above default) have fallen to below 7 percent from double digits only a year ago. Further, covenant-light lending is on a tear. The “oil gauge” indicates the Fed has supplied plenty of lubrication for the engine of job creation.\n\nProfessional Forecasters Have Been Disappointed Thus Far…\n\nOver the four years since the recession ended in June 2009, GDP growth has averaged just 2.1 percent, hewing to a narrow year-over-year range of 1.5 to 2.8 percent. It is noteworthy that the fraternity of professional economic forecasters has been consistently disappointed: Forecasts made at the beginning of 2010, 2011 and 2012 all overpredicted growth. At the onset of this year, the median forecast for 2013 called for 2.4 percent GDP growth, and that, too, has been challenged by first-quarter data that came in below expectations, raising fears of “déjà vu all over again.”\n\n…But April Could Signal Improvement\n\nHowever, the April jobs report and revisions of previous jobs data have put some spring back in economists’ steps. Initial claims for unemployment insurance are now back on a downward trend, retreating to prerecession levels, and Monday’s retail sales numbers were a nice upside surprise. This indicates that consumers may have digested delayed tax rebates and the increase in payroll taxes, and are reaping the benefits of lower gasoline and food prices. So the recovery presently appears to be strong enough to propel hopes that employment growth will continue improving over the near term.\n\nAs to Inflation…\n\nOf course, the Fed’s most sacred duty is to see to the maintenance of price stability. Today, inflation is benign. With a jobless rate still well north of 7 percent, labor compensation rising at less than 2 percent per year, an outlook for abundant food crops and expanding energy sources, and near-record profit margins among operating businesses, there appears to be little risk that we will see significant cost-push pressures in 2013. In addition, slower growth around the globe is putting the damper on demand-pull inflation. Provided that the public remains confident in the Fed’s commitment to long-run price stability, anchored by the FOMC’s stated commitment to a target of 2 percent, my reading of the entrails of the Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate currently indicates we will likely end this year somewhere between 1.5 percent and our 2 percent long-run goal. [2]\n\nAs a hawk in the aviary of policymakers, I have for some years now said that the issue at present is not a meaningful threat to price stability in the immediate future. The issue is job creation. And the questions I keep raising at FOMC meetings regard our ability to affect it.\n\nTime to Reset the Fed’s Sails?\n\nHaving spent the happiest of my formative years preparing for and attending the U.S. Naval Academy, then paying my way through Harvard sailing oceangoing yachts as a hired hand, I am given to seafaring analogies. Here is how I would summarize our most recent journey:\n\nThe current chairman, Ben Bernanke, took the wheel at the Fed just as we sailed into a tempest that nearly capsized our economy. He and his able crew kept the ship of the economy from floundering and navigated it past the rocks of depression and deflation. The Bernanke-led FOMC steered clear of the shoals of economic collapse by jury-rigging the vessel of monetary policy in an unconventional and unprecedented manner. Now the ship of the Fed is in more benign waters and is sailing forward. The question before us is this: Are we moving forward at sufficient speed to allow the Fed to reset our rigging and our sails, eventually going back to a more conventional configuration?\n\nThe answer lies in the economic outlook. I am wary of giving pinpoint forecasts of economic growth. As I mentioned earlier, professional forecasters, including the very capable staff of the Federal Reserve, have fallen short on this front, time and again, during the recovery and on numerous occasions before that. I am always mindful of the memorable comments of Ken Arrow. You may recall them:\n\nDuring World War II, Arrow served as a weather officer in the Army Air Corps. He and his team were charged with producing month-ahead weather forecasts. Being a disciplined analyst, Arrow reviewed the record of his predictions and, sure enough, confirmed statistically that the corps’ forecasts were no more accurate than random rolls of dice. He asked to be relieved of this futile duty. Arrow’s recollection of the response from on high was priceless: “The commanding general is well aware that the forecasts are no good. However, he needs them for planning purposes.”\n\nWith that caveat in mind, my staff and I think there is a better-than-even chance that the present GDP growth consensus forecast of 2.4 percent by professional economists may be underestimating the underlying pace of growth. The housing market is in resurgence, contributing significant impetus to the economy. The Fed’s senior loan officer surveys indicate that commercial banks are becoming more accommodative lenders, albeit remaining cautious. [3] The snapback in housing and the harnessing of cheap and abundant money by the business sector have made for more manageable financial obligations. State and local governments, not just in Texas but elsewhere in the nation, are on a better financial footing and no longer appear to be a major drag on growth. As this audience knows better than anybody, new technologies are providing for cheaper and more abundant energy. Consumers continue consuming. Monetary policy is hyper-accommodative, driving interest rates to historic lows and equity markets to historic highs; if anything, it may be giving rise to excessive speculation and risk taking. (In addition to the pricing of CCC debt and the surge in low-covenant lending, margin debt is climbing rapidly.)\n\nI have advocated that we begin to reef in the sails, beginning with our MBS purchase program. In my view, the housing market is on a self-sustaining path and does not need the same impetus we have been giving it. In recent months, under its balance-sheet expansion program, the Fed has bought about 50 percent of gross issuance of agency MBS, partly to replace prepayments of our MBS holdings. When refinancing activity eventually shifts down, the Fed could soon be buying up to 100 percent of MBS issuance if the current purchase program continues. I believe buying such a high share of gross issuance in any security is not only excessive, but also potentially disruptive to the proper functioning of the MBS market. I have never been comfortable with our investing in anything but Treasuries, being wary of a central bank engaging in credit allocation and favoring specific sectors of the economy. It brings to mind the fears Thomas Jefferson and James Madison had about the slippery slope of Alexander Hamilton’s First Bank of the United States, recently recalled in Jon Meacham’s brilliant book on Jefferson: “They feared that the Hamiltonian program would enable financial speculators to benefit from commercial transactions made possible by government funds.”[4]\n\nYet I admit that given the crucial role housing plays in our economy and the dire straits the housing market was in at the time, I did hold my nose and vote for the first tranche of MBS purchases. I believe that initiative was helpful in jump-starting the housing market. But now I believe the efficacy of continued purchases is questionable. And I consider holding $1.1 trillion and counting of MBS as a possible impairment to our ability to maneuver our balance sheet with the nimbleness and alacrity we might need. I think we can rightly declare victory on the housing front and reef in (or dial back) our purchases, with the aim of eliminating them entirely as the year wears on.\n\nEnter Fiscal Policy. Oy!\n\nEven if we at the Dallas Fed are right and the overall outlook for the economy is better than the current dashboard or the conventional prognostications of economists, there exists a formidable brake on growth. It was referred to point-blank in the last statement issued by the FOMC: “…fiscal policy is restraining economic growth.”[5]\n\nFiscal policy is inhibiting the transmission of monetary policy into robust job creation.\n\nAs it is early in the morning and a little levity is always helpful in making a point, here is my favorite spoof on the historical behavior of fiscal policy makers:\n\n\n\nThis would be funny if it were not so sad. The propensity of members of Congress has been to spend in excess of revenues to give pleasure to their constituents and garner their affection. They just didn’t get the memo that Jefferson wrote to Madison:“We are ruined, Sir, if we do not overrule the principles that ‘the more we owe, the more prosperous we shall be,’ [and] ‘that a public debt furnishes the means of enterprise.’” [6] The good news is that, some 200-plus years later, the memo seems to have finally been received; there are numerous plans to rein in Congress’ spendthrift ways and there have been improvements that have brightened the short-term outlook for the level of federal debt. [7] But, as yet, there has been little more than passive action. Until the Congress and the president provide a clear road map as to how fiscal rectitude will be implemented, this lack of credible details for limiting the debt-to-GDP ratio and reengineering fiscal policy to stimulate rather than constrain growth is creating undue uncertainty about future tax rates, future government purchases, future retiree benefits and all manner of factors that impact employment and economic growth. Meanwhile, the divisive nature and petty posturing of those who must determine the fiscal path of the nation is further undermining confidence and limiting the effectiveness of monetary policy.\n\nHere is the rub: Even if the arguments of those who wish for greater fiscal stimulus prevail, expansion in government purchases will have reduced effectiveness if it is thought that those purchases will be financed with higher future marginal tax rates. If you are an operating business, you have to discount this risk before adding significantly to payrolls and before undertaking capital expansion. In a similar vein, you need to consider how the opposite approach of cutting government expenditures might impact your top line if the cuts are in areas that affect the markets you sell into. Add to that the enormous uncertainty about how health care reform will impact your cost structure. And add to that the fact that community bankers—providers of the lifeblood of loans to small businesses, which are the impetus for new job creation and economic rejuvenation—are hamstrung by burdensome regulations and fees imposed in response to the misbehavior of their too-big-to-fail brethren. If you consider the economy from this perspective, you can see where brakes of our own government’s making are being applied to a realization of our growth potential.\n\nDecisionmaking under conditions of uncertainty is always a challenge for businesses; decisionmaking in a thick fog of uncertainty is well-nigh impossible. It negates the power of hyper-accommodative monetary policy to propel our economic vessel forward. The restraining influence of rudderless fiscal policy is readily seen in the piling up of excess reserves on the balance sheets of banks and in the coffers of operating businesses.\n\nI argue that the Fed has no hope of moving the economy to full employment unless our fiscal authorities get their act together. Those economic agents with the wherewithal to expand payrolls and put the American people back to work must have confidence that our fiscal authorities and regulation makers—the legislative and the executive—will reorganize the tax code, spending habits and the regulatory regime so that the cheap and abundant money we at the Fed have made available to invest in job-creating capital expansion in the United States is put to use. Until then, I argue that the Fed is, at best, pushing on a string and, at worst, building up kindling for a massive shipboard fire of eventual inflation.\n\nAll the World’s a Stage (and All the Policymakers Merely Players)\n\nIt is thus as-yet unclear whether the benefits of the strategy the Fed has taken outweigh its costs. Only time will tell. The Federal Open Market Committee will have to wait for the verdict of history. Scholars know that Shakespearian plays all have five acts. I would suggest that we are but in the third act of a play—we had the tempest in Act 1; the jury-rigging of monetary policy and radical maneuvers by the Fed to save the ship in Act 2; and in the present act, we are back on course but somewhat becalmed, sailing at less-than-desired cruising speed even as we have cranked up an auxiliary motor of large-scale asset purchases. Act 4 will involve the travails and challenges of adjusting our policy course, fine-tuning the motor and rearranging the rigging. And not until the final act will we know whether we have achieved the felicitous outcome that is the hallmark of most romantic plays, or whether the melancholy that defines a tragedy awaits us.\n\nThe romantic outcome ends, as most all Shakespearian comedies do, in a marriage—in this case, a marriage of sensible fiscal and monetary policy that lifts employment and carries the American economy to new heights.\n\nThe tragic outcome is one in which the fiscal authorities—the Congress and the president—are unable to provide incentives for risk takers to make use of the cheap and abundant capital the Fed has made available, and the play ends in a debasement of the central bank and the ruination of our economy and lifestyle.\n\nThe former outcome is that envisioned by the theoreticians that lead the Fed: According to this plot, by driving rates to historical lows along the entire length of the yield curve, investors will rebalance their portfolios and reach out to riskier assets, providing the financial wherewithal for businesses to increase capital expenditures and reengage workers, expand payrolls and regenerate consumption. Rising prices of bonds, stocks and other financial instruments will bolster consumer confidence. The CliffsNotes account of this play has the widely heralded “wealth effect” paving the way for economic expansion, thus saving the day.\n\nThe latter outcome posits that the wealth effect is limited, for two possible reasons. One is that our continued purchases of Treasuries are having decreasing effects on private borrowing costs, given how low long-term Treasury rates already are. Another is that the uncertainty resulting from fiscal tomfoolery is a serious obstacle to restoring full employment. Until job creators are properly incentivized by fiscal and regulatory policy to harness the cheap and abundant money we at the Fed have engineered, these funds will predominantly benefit those with the means to speculate, tilling the fields of finance for returns that are enabled by historically low rates but do not readily result in job expansion. Cheap capital inures to the benefit of the Warren Buffetts, who can discount lower hurdle rates to achieve their investors’ expectations, accumulating holdings without necessarily expanding employment or the wealth of the overall economy.\n\nI hold no vendetta against the Buffetts of the world, having once been a junior member of that class—I made a nice living during the 1980s and ’90s buying operating assets for nickels and dimes and turning them into dollars by rationalizing and downsizing them. And like legions of others, I have for countless years read the Oracle of Omaha’s annual statement with admiration for his prowess as an investor and profit-seeker. But my role as a policymaker is different from my previous role as an investor: I have sworn fealty to a dual mandate of conducting monetary policy so as to maintain price stability AND create the monetary conditions for full employment and prosperity for all, not just for the rich and the quick. This, I fear, we will fail to do unless Congress and the president develop and deliver on a strategy that complements ours at the Fed.\n\nThis may be a sour ending to a somber song, but, after all, economics is not called “the dismal science” for nothing. Have a nice day!\n\nNow, in the best tradition of central bankers, I would be happy to avoid answering your questions.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "April 10, 2013El Paso, TX\n\nI so appreciate being here at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), my first outing since returning from a trip to the United Arab Emirates. The founder of the Emirates—a collection of former “Trucial States” along the lower coast of the Arabian Sea—was Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, a wise man who had no formal education but knew of its enormous value. He said, “Education is a lantern which lights the dark alleys of ignorance.”[1]\n\nI mention this because I cannot think of an educator who embodies this practical dictum better than Diana Natalicio. President Natalicio is a bright, shining lantern in the world of education. Actually, that’s an understatement: She is a klieg light! We are blessed to have her lead UTEP and move Texas and the nation forward on the frontiers of higher education. I am tremendously honored to be introduced by her. Thank you, Diana.\n\nI am going to depart from my usual format today and rely heavily on slides—slides that provide a factual basis for what is going to be a dose of “Texas brag.” With its branches in El Paso, San Antonio and Houston, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas—the Federal Reserve’s Eleventh District—covers about 27 million people over 360,000 square miles stretching from northern Louisiana to southern New Mexico. Over 96 percent of the economic output of the district comes from Texas.\n\nI find that when I speak about my district in foreign lands—say, in New York or Washington, D.C.—there is a stereotypical reaction not unlike the image projected by the TV show Dallas. “Of course you are doing well,” they say. “You are rich in oil and gas, blondes and over-accessorized brunettes, and ruthless, hard-drinking cowboys.” Today, I want to set the record straight.\n\nThe road to dignity is through work: Jobs provide the means for economic advancement. As the nation’s central bank, the Federal Reserve is tasked with maintaining price stability—a common monetary policy goal of all responsible central banks. But under the laws created by Congress that govern our franchise and allow it to operate independently, the Fed works under a dual mandate—to conduct monetary policy that keeps prices from inflating or deflating and to achieve full employment.\n\nAt the moment, and for the foreseeable future, neither inflation nor deflation appears on the forecast horizon. However, the longer-term inflationary consequences of the massive quantitative easing programs we have undertaken—programs I have opposed in our Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings but that have been approved by the majority of the committee—are as yet unclear. Those aftereffects will depend on how artful the committee will be in unwinding that accommodation on a timely basis. Indeed, one of the signal achievements of Federal Reserve policy under Ben Bernanke’s leadership is to have formalized a long-term inflation target of 2 percent, something the FOMC had never before distinctly declared.\n\nPresently, the 12-month inflation rate is 1.6 percent, according to our calculation at the Dallas Fed, where we do a “trimmed mean” analysis of 178 items consumers use, including guns and beer (hopefully not enjoyed simultaneously) and the cost of gasoline, food, getting your hair cut or your shoes repaired, or buying an electronic device. Given that the trimmed mean analysis has proven to be an excellent rule-of-thumb predictor of headline inflation one year forward, we can say with some degree of confidence that, at present, we are keeping inflation at or below our 2 percent target.\n\nEmployment, however, is not at a comfortable level. Pick up any newspaper or go to any news website or broadcast medium and you will read or hear of the still-too-high unemployment rate that bedevils our economy. Monetary policy acts with a lag, including unorthodox monetary policy as it is now being conducted. It would appear from some studies and from anecdotal evidence that companies are starting to use the copious cheap money they have access to for investing in capital projects and employing increasing amounts of workers.[2] But it is not yet clear that we will achieve a justifiable bang for the trillions of bucks the Fed has flooded the economy with. Only time will tell if the efficacy of quantitative easing we have undertaken was justifiable in regard to job creation and delivering on the second component of our dual mandate.\n\nYet many things do emerge when you examine the entrails of employment data from across the country. One thing is that you learn a lot about Texas, which is the focus of my remarks today.\n\nFor the past 22 years, Texas has outgrown the country by a factor of more than 2-to-1. Here is a slide that shows the percentage increase in jobs created by several large states and for the U.S. as a whole since 1990:\n\n\n\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nAnd here is a look at the rate of job creation for those same states and the U.S. as a whole since 2000:\n\n\n\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nWe were one of the last states to go into the recent recession and one of the first to come out. In terms of jobs, as of now, 10 states have come back to or have exceeded employment levels that prevailed before the crisis: Alaska, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and West Virginia.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has no index that measures the number of blondes or ruthless cowboys in Texas, but we can account for the influence of oil and gas on our state’s welfare: Oil and gas extraction and mining support directly accounts for 2.4 percent of our workforce—two-point-four percent. And the energy sector’s total contribution to our state’s gross domestic product (GDP) is roughly 10 percent. So yes, the foreigners are correct: We have a strong energy sector in Texas. We are the No. 1 producer of oil and gas in the nation. We produce more oil than Venezuela and more natural gas than Canada. On net, high energy prices do, indeed, benefit Texans.\n\nBut look at this slide of the number of jobs created by sector in 2012:\n\n\n\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nOil and gas and mining and their support services accounted for 22,100, or less than 7 percent, of the 335,500 jobs created in Texas last year. Professional and business services accounted for 74,200; trade, transportation and utilities 62,000; leisure and hospitality 52,400; educational and health services 41,000; and construction 27,000. Each of these sectors created more jobs than the energy sector. Of course, the oil and gas sector has large multipliers, so the overall economic impact is greater than just these 22,100 jobs. The University of Texas at San Antonio—your sister organization—estimates that the Eagle Ford Shale generated over $61 billion in economic impact in 2012. As this chart shows, however, ours is a diversified economy, creating jobs across the spectrum.\n\n“But these jobs are all low paying,” our uninformed friends say. And to that I respond: “You are right. We create more low-paying jobs in Texas than anybody else. Yet look at this breakdown of job creation by income quartile for Texas versus the United States minus Texas for the past 10-plus years”:\n\n\n\nSOURCE: March CPS, 2001, 2012.\n\nWe created a lot of low-paying jobs. But we also created far more high-paying jobs. Most importantly, while the United States has seen job destruction in the two middle-income quartiles, Texas has created jobs for those vital middle-income workers, too.\n\nThe bottom line—we have experienced growth across all sectors and in all income categories. And it continues: In February, job growth in Texas was an annualized 6.9 percent. Year to date, construction, trade and transportation, and professional and business services have led the pack in what we believe will be another year of employment growth that, knock on wood, will approach 3 percent.\n\nHere are some other facts that help round out the economic picture of our state.\n\nOur banks are more profitable than those in the rest of the nation …\n\n\n\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nIn the housing sector, we have fewer underwater mortgages …\n\n\n\nSOURCE: CoreLogic.\n\nRobust new-home construction …\n\n\n\nSOURCES: U.S. Census Bureau; Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.\n\nAnd an export sector that has come out of the recession like gee-whiz. In, fact, you can see from this graph that without Texas, the top blue line, exports from the rest of the United States, indicated by the red line, are hovering around the peak level of 2008:\n\n\n\nSOURCES: Census Bureau; World Institute for Strategic Economic Research; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas\n\nMy little nephew, Charles, was playing with a three-dimensional wooden puzzle map of the United States in his preschool class the other day. He came home with the piece that was Texas and a smirk on his face: “Mom,” he said, “guess what? If you pull Texas out of the puzzle of the United States, the rest of the country falls down!”\n\nAlthough little Charles lives in Massachusetts, he gets the picture. It came as no surprise when a recent study by the highly respected Brookings Institution, as reported in the Wall Street Journal last week, revealed that only 14 of the nation’s 100 biggest metropolitan areas have more people employed than they did before the 2007–09 recession and that six of them are in Texas: Austin, San Antonio, McAllen, Dallas, Houston and … El Paso. “Robust employment in the oil and gas industries helped the Texas cities,” the article read, “although data from the Texas Workforce Commission suggests the job recovery has come from a variety of industries.”[3] Amen to that.\n\nYou’ll note that El Paso was mentioned in the Brookings study. Let’s talk a little about this unique city.\n\nIt’s no small wonder that of the 23,000 students enrolled at UTEP, 77 percent are Mexican–Americans and another 6 percent commute from Ciudad Juárez, across the border. El Paso is at the very nexus of the cultures and economies of two countries. As Roberto Coronado, our economist and assistant vice president in charge at our El Paso Branch, likes to point out, “Given its unique geographic position, El Paso is very good at importing recessions both from the north and from the south of the Rio Grande.” I would add that it’s also good at drawing from the best of both countries in recoveries. The El Paso labor market has outperformed that of the U.S. for several years. Here is a graph that shows how the El Paso employment picture has changed relative to the U.S. since the onset of the Great Recession:\n\n\n\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics; HAVER Analytics.\n\nNow, as the following chart demonstrates, it remains a fact that the local employment picture is less bright in El Paso than in Texas’s other major metro areas.\n\n\n\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics; HAVER Analytics.\n\nThe unemployment rate here is hovering around 9 percent. El Paso’s unemployment rate has historically been 2 percentage points higher than the U.S. rate and 3.2 percentage points above the Texas rate. In part, this is due to population growth. El Paso had more than 21 million border crossings in 2011 alone. Most of these visitors came to shop, but many stayed and looked for jobs. These visitors increase the number of job seekers in the unemployment equation, driving the rate upward.\n\nOf additional concern is that El Paso is more dependent on federal government employment than any other Texas city, with 5 percent of your workforce coming from the public sector. And that is before accounting for the payroll of Fort Bliss itself and the impact it has on private-sector employment and consumption. Clearly, El Paso is quite vulnerable to constriction in the growth of federal spending. This will ultimately present serious challenges as the federal government struggles to right its fiscal imbalances.\n\nBut there is good news that offsets that risk:\n\nThanks to the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA—an agreement that, as Diana mentioned, I played a role in implementing as deputy U.S. trade representative—El Paso is no longer at the edge of the United States but, instead, at a strategic location in the vast North American market.\n\nIn this context, the maquiladoras of Ciudad Juárez become an important factor determining El Paso’s economic fate. The relationship exists via a ricochet effect that begins with U.S. industrial activity picking up, say in auto manufacturing, followed by new production orders being sent to Ciudad Juárez maquiladora plants and then economic benefits flowing back to El Paso. The flowback to El Paso comes from firms on this side of the border providing logistical support, insurance and other services to the maquiladoras—as well as in the aforementioned form of maquiladora employees shopping and consuming more on this side of the border. And, as this table shows, it results in an increase of high-value-added sales of El Paso-based services into Ciudad Juárez, making up for reductions in manufacturing jobs on this side of the border:\n\nAs the maquiladora example illustrates, Mexico has a significant impact on the fate of the El Paso economy.\n\nThis is fortunate because the Mexican economy is being transformed to a greater degree than most people here in El Norte understand.\n\nOn Sunday, the Dallas Morning News kindly ran an op-ed piece I wrote based on the work of our Dallas Fed economists, titled “Mexico Outdoes the U.S. on Fiscal Discipline.”[4] The article outlines the great progress Mexico has made in transforming its economy and the significant steps taken by President Enrique Peña Nieto in the footsteps of his predecessors, from President Calderon back to President Salinas.\n\nHere are the facts:\n\nMexico recovered more quickly from the recession than the United States.\n\nMexico’s 3.3 percent GDP growth in 2012 compares with the U.S.’s 1.7 percent.\n\nMexico, home to 1980s hyperinflation and a poster child of that decade’s Latin American debt crisis, has recorded a core consumer price index annual inflation rate below 3 percent for the last three months. In fact, inflation in Mexico has trended down for two decades following two important reforms: central bank independence in 1994 and adoption of inflation targeting in 2001.\n\nMeanwhile, the peso, floating since late 1994, held its own through the global financial crisis. And year to date, the peso has gained 6.9 percent against the dollar.\n\nLow and stable inflation, together with a steady peso, has protected the purchasing power of the Mexican consumer and allowed nest eggs to grow. Those nest eggs can now be safely deposited in banks. After a horrific banking crisis in 1994–95 and an ensuing decade of stagnant lending, Mexico’s banking industry is growing again and financial access, while still limited, is expanding quickly. The number of Mexican banks increased 14.3 percent in 2012; in the U.S., the number of institutions contracted 3.1 percent. It may be surprising to you that Mexican banks are also better capitalized than U.S. banks. As of Dec. 31, 2012, equity-to-asset ratios were 11.1 percent at U.S. banks and 15.9 percent at Mexican banks.\n\nOn the fiscal front, Mexico’s 2012 budget deficit was a respectable 2.6 percent of GDP, which compares with 7 percent here. For all their differences, Mexican lawmakers on the right and the left have a commitment to fiscal discipline. They adopted a balanced-budget rule in 2006 and have chosen to abide by it rather than take the “kick the can down the road” approach of the U.S. Congress. As a result, Mexico’s national debt is stable at 28 percent of GDP, while here it raced past $16 trillion in 2012, about 105 percent of GDP.\n\nMexico has also remained a staunch proponent of free trade. Exports and imports now make up 62 percent of Mexican economic output versus 17.5 percent as recently as 1980. Since Mexico joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (the forerunner of the World Trade Organization) in 1986 and ratified NAFTA in 1994, it has forged 12 trade pacts with 44 nations.\n\nWith all the progress in the macro economy, banking, finance and trade, structural reforms are what Mexico now needs to catapult it to a leadership role among emerging-market economies. If President Peña Nieto’s first 100 days in office are any indication, this critical next step is underway. He has engineered the Pacto por México (Pact for Mexico) with the other political parties; arrested Elba Esther Gordillo, the corrupt leader of the massive national teachers’ union; brought a class-action suit against Carlos Slim’s growth-retarding telecommunications empire; and begun a national conversation about reforming the country’s woefully underperforming, yet potentially rich energy sector.\n\nIf this effort at structural modernization continues, Mexico’s growth will increase significantly.\n\nAll of this will be good for El Paso. Just as El Paso suffers when recession afflicts both sides of the border, it will prosper as expansion takes hold here in the U.S. and in Mexico.\n\nLet me give you a pictorial summary of this lecture:\n\n\n\nWe are blessed by a force of nature named Diana Natalicio (a Texas blonde, by the way!) …\n\n\n\nBy UTEP as a symbol of El Paso’s critical place at the crossroads of North America…\n\n\n\nBy having the good fortune to live in Texas …\n\n\n\nAnd by sharing a border with an increasingly successful neighbor to our south.\n\nBut we also have challenges. It would be unbecoming of a central banker to be entirely optimistic—we are a pretty sober species. So here is the bad news. Here’s what is holding back the economic progress of El Paso, Texas, Mexico and America:\n\n\n\nYup—Washington. The Federal Reserve has provided plenty of, if not too much, high-octane fuel in the form of cheap and abundant money to propel the economy forward. Our southern neighbor, Mexico, is responsibly managing its fiscal affairs and structural reforms (as is our northern neighbor, Canada).\n\nTexas is showing the nation the way to create jobs and encourage prosperity with a highly diversified economy. And yet Congress and executive branch cannot agree on a budget, or on a path forward for taxes and spending, or on a regulatory structure that incentivizes business to put people back to work.\n\nThis is the subject of an entire separate lecture. But to summarize the root fiscal problem of past Congresses and administrations, Democrat- or Republican-led, my staff found a clip on YouTube that sums it up better than words:\n\n\n\nThat sketch says it all. We must all pray that our president and our congressional representatives will find a way to reverse their spendthrift ways and do what is right by putting us back on the path of fiscal probity.\n\nEl Paso and Texas have done well despite the disorderly behavior of our nation’s fiscal authorities. Imagine how well we would do if they actually managed to get their act together!\n\nAs we eagerly await that day, let us be thankful for the exceptional nature of this great state, this great city and this wonderful university. ¡Ándale Pues!\n\nGracias.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "March 16, 2013 National Harbor, Maryland\n\nThank you, Chad [Barth].\n\nI gather you all held a big dinner last night in honor of Ronald Reagan. My father-in-law, the late Congressman Jim Collins, was a good friend of the president. During the Convention of 1984, which was held in Dallas, Congressman Collins invited me to join a handful of family and friends to visit with Mr. Reagan. The president was in remarkable form and, great raconteur that he was, told this story:\n\nPaddy McCoy, a hardworking Irish farmer, received a visit from an inspector of the Department for Works and Pensions.\n\n“Tell me about your staff,” he asked of Paddy.\n\n“Well,” said Paddy, “there are the farmhands. I pay them 240 a week and they have use of a free cottage.”\n\n“That’s good,” said the inspector.\n\n“Then there’s the housekeeper. She gets 190 a week, along with free board and lodging.”\n\n“That sounds fine,” said the inspector.\n\nPaddy went on to tell of the rest of his staff, all to the pleasant reception of the inspector. And then he said, “Now, there’s also the half-wit. He bears all the risk of this business, works a 16-hour day, nets about 25 a week when all is said and done, but takes down a bottle of whiskey and, as a special treat, occasionally gets to sleep with my wife.”\n\n“That’s disgraceful, Paddy,” said the inspector. “I need to interview the half-wit.”\n\n“Well,” said Paddy, “you’re lookin’ at him.”\n\nPaddy McCoy was no half-wit: He simply represented the plight of the hardworking souls who want to be left alone to labor day and night to put food on the table for their employees and family. They ask for no advantage, just a level playing field and fair treatment. I am here today to speak of the plight of hardworking Main Street bankers who simply want to be given a level playing field and fair treatment in competing with megabanks.\n\nChad, the last time I spoke to an audience here in the nation’s capital, I was introduced by a descendant of the iconic patriot Patrick Henry.\n\nIn one of Patrick Henry’s greatest speeches, he noted that, “Different men often see the same subject in different lights.” And then he went on to appeal to all perspectives to do right: “This is no time for ceremony,” he said, for it “… is one of awful moment to this country.”\n\nThe great patriot was, of course, addressing the injustice of operating under the thumb of the British Crown. This morning, I am going to address what I consider the injustice of operating our economy under the thumb of financial institutions that are so large they are considered “too big to fail” (TBTF).\n\nI will argue that these institutions operate under a privileged status that exacts an unfair tax upon the American people.\n\nI will argue that they represent not only a threat to financial stability but to fair and open competition, that they are the practitioners of crony capitalism and not the agents of democratic capitalism that makes our country great.\n\nI will argue that by the attorney general’s own admission, their privileged status places them above the rule of law.\n\nI will argue that the effort crafted by Congress to correct the problems of TBTF—known as the Dodd–Frank Act—is, despite its best intentions, counterproductive and needs to be changed, that it is an example of the triumph of hope over experience.\n\nAnd, last, I will argue that dealing with TBTF is a cause that should be embraced by conservatives, liberals and moderates alike. For regardless of your ideological bent, there is no escaping the reality that TBTF banks’ bad decisions inflicted harm upon the American people during the “awful moment” of the 2008–09 crisis. The American people will be grateful to whoever liberates them from a recurrence of taxpayer bailouts.\n\nNow, Federal Reserve convention requires that I issue a disclaimer here: As always, I speak only for myself, not for others associated with our nation’s central bank. That usually is abundantly clear. It will be especially so today. There are different views on this issue within the Fed; like Patrick Henry’s co-patriots, we “see the same subject in different lights.” The chairman of the Fed, Ben Bernanke, and at least two other governors, Daniel Tarullo and Jerome Powell, all good friends and men I greatly admire, have different views than ours in Dallas about how to address the problem of TBTF. You should consider their views.[1] Today, I’ll simply give you mine.\n\nHere are the facts: A dozen megabanks today control almost 70 percent of the assets in the U.S. banking industry. The concentration of assets has been ongoing, but it intensified during the 2008–09 financial crisis, when several failing giants were absorbed by larger, presumably healthier ones. The result is a lopsided financial system.\n\nToday, these megabanks—a mere 0.2 percent of banks, deemed candidates to be considered “too big to fail”—are treated differently from the other 99.8 percent and differently from other businesses. Implicit government policy has made the megabank institutions exempt from the normal processes of bankruptcy and creative destruction. Without fear of failure, these banks and their counterparties can take excessive risks.\n\nTheir exalted status also emboldens a sense of immunity from the law. As Attorney General Eric Holder frankly admitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee on March 6, when banks are considered too big to fail, it is “difficult for us to prosecute them … if you do bring a criminal charge, it will have a negative impact on the national economy.”[2]\n\nThe megabanks can raise capital more cheaply than can smaller banks. Studies, including those published by the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements, estimate this advantage to be as much as 1 percentage point, or some $50 billion to $100 billion annually for U.S. TBTF banks, during the period surrounding the financial crisis.[3] In a popular post by editors at Bloomberg, the 10 largest U.S. banks are estimated to enjoy an aggregate longer-term subsidy of $83 billion per year.[4]\n\nAndy Haldane, executive director for financial stability at the Bank of England, estimates the current implicit TBTF subsidy to be roughly $300 billion per year for the 29 global institutions identified as “systemically important.”[5]\n\nGiven this range of estimates, Senators [Sherrod] Brown of Ohio and [David] Vitter of Louisiana have asked the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to calculate just how much of a cost-of-funds advantage the big banks have over the 5,570 banking organizations that make up the 99.8 percent that are not too big to fail.\n\nAs pointed out in Thursday’s New York Times blog by Simon Johnson, the noted MIT economist, all one has to do is ask people in the credit markets if they think lenders to the biggest banks have some degree of protection offered by the government, and you will hear a resounding yes![6]\n\nAt the Dallas Fed, we believe that whatever the precise subsidy number is, it exists, it is significant, and it allows the biggest banking organizations, along with their many nonbank subsidiaries (investment firms, securities lenders, finance companies), to grow larger and riskier.\n\nThis is patently unfair. It makes for an uneven playing field, tilted to the advantage of Wall Street against Main Street, placing the financial system and the economy in constant jeopardy.\n\nIt also undermines citizens’ faith in the rule of law and representative democracy.\n\nThe 2010 Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was a well-intentioned response to the problem. However, its stated promise—to end too big to fail—rings hollow. Running 849 pages and with more than 9,000 pages of regulations written so far to implement it, Dodd–Frank is long on process and complexity but short on results.\n\nRegulators cannot enforce rules that are not easily understood.\n\nNor can they enforce these rules without creating armies of new bureaucrats. Congress’s Financial Services Committee aggregates information from the Federal Register that estimates the cumulative hours needed for the affected agencies, like the Fed, to fulfill new requirements called for by Dodd–Frank. The committee presently estimates that it will take 24,180,856 hours each year to comply with new rules already finalized for implementation of the act.[7] And we have yet to complete the rulemaking process!\n\nI work every day with my colleagues at the Fed to craft the monetary conditions to help the economy create jobs. This is not the kind of job creation I would hope for.\n\nFurther, despite the plethora of new rules and regulations created by Dodd–Frank, market discipline is still lacking for the largest dozen or so institutions, as it was during the last financial crisis. Why should a prospective purchaser of bank debt practice due diligence if, in the end, regardless of new layers of regulation and oversight, it is widely perceived that the issuing institution will not be allowed to fail?\n\nThe return of marketplace discipline and effective due diligence of banking behemoths is long overdue. My colleagues and I at the Dallas Fed offer a modest proposal to that end, with a goal of leveling the playing field for all.\n\nFirst, we would roll back the federal safety net—deposit insurance and the Federal Reserve’s discount window—to apply only to traditional commercial banks and not to the nonbank affiliates of bank holding companies or the parent companies themselves (for which the safety net was never intended).\n\nSecond, customers, creditors and counterparties of all nonbank affiliates and the parent holding companies would sign a simple, legally binding, unambiguous disclosure acknowledging and accepting that there is no government guarantee—ever—backstopping their investment. A similar disclaimer would apply to banks’ deposits outside the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) protection limit and other unsecured debts.\n\nThird, we recommend that the largest financial holding companies be restructured so that every one of their corporate entities is subject to a speedy bankruptcy process, and in the case of the banking entities themselves, that they be of a size that is “too small to save.” Addressing institutional size is vital to maintaining a credible threat of failure, thereby providing a convincing case that policy has truly changed. This step gets both bank incentives and structure right, neither of which is accomplished by Dodd–Frank.\n\nThe downsized, formerly too-big-to-fail banks would then be just like the other 99.8 percent, failing with finality when necessary—closed on Friday and reopened on Monday under new ownership and management in the customary process administered by the FDIC.\n\nThe aim of our three-step proposal is simple: All banks would be subject to the same regulatory oversight—and most important, they all would be subject to the market discipline exercised by owners and creditors.\n\nHad this plan been in place a decade ago, it would have altered the insidious behaviors that contributed to the crisis, avoiding the bailouts and their aftermath, the cost of which our nation’s citizens will bear for years to come. The GAO and others estimate that the cost of the financial crisis, measured in lost production and jobs, could exceed roughly one whole year of U.S. output.[8]\n\nMost of all, adoption of a proposal such as ours would have avoided a crisis that undermined Americans’ belief in the fairness and justice of the economic system. The United States was founded on the principle of economic freedom, underpinned by secure property rights and by a strong aversion to special favors and subsidies to the few. Those fundamental virtues were undermined by the recent financial crisis and government’s response to it.\n\nRescuing too-big-to-fail banks from their bad investment decisions imposed an enormous economic burden on the American people. It also perpetuated a sense that powerful banking mandarins operate above the law and prosper at the expense of the thrifty and hardworking citizenry.\n\nWithout delay, Congress should rewrite Dodd–Frank so that it actually ends the problem of banks that are too big to fail. Our proposal provides a road map for doing so. It will not lead to bigger government. It will, instead, lead to less but more effective regulation, banks that are governed by the market discipline of creditors who are at real risk of loss, and laws that apply equally to all.\n\nIn my introduction, I referred to Patrick Henry. In the speech I quoted, he went on to say, “It is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope. We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the song of that siren till she transforms us.” I implore you to be practical and not succumb merely to the illusion of hope. Don’t listen to the siren song of the megabanks and their lobbyists. Take action to deal with the unfair advantages that these institutions enjoy. They will spend millions of dollars to try to perpetuate their brand of crony capitalism. Resisting their entreaties is the right thing to do. Leveling the playing field is a just cause for all Americans. It demands redress from those who represent us in the halls of Congress, whatever side of the aisle they sit on.\n\nBy Tuesday, the Dallas Fed will release an additional essay on this very subject, together with responses to the questions and criticisms we have received about our proposal, including those raised by proponents for the megabanks. I ask you to go on the net and read that report.[9] But for now, I simply thank you for having me here today, and I wish you Godspeed.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "February 27, 2013 New York, N.Y.\n\nThank you, Professor [Merit] Janow. The title of this lectureship far overstates my standing and capacity—I am unworthy of being considered “distinguished” at anything other than having helped raise four children whose talents far surpass my own. But I thank you for this momentarily hyperbolic honor.[1]\n\nAs Merit mentioned, we go back a long way. Yet my involvement with Columbia University and Morningside Heights goes back much further. After I graduated from Harvard in 1971, I needed money to pay for Oxford, so I spent most of a year working as a busboy and bartender and doing a number of odd jobs in Washington, D.C.—testimony to the immediate benefits of a Harvard degree in economics! Starved for intellectual sustenance as I waited to return to academia, I found comfort in reading about public policy, especially in the essays of what was then a new journal, The Public Interest.\n\nThe Public Interest was the brainchild of Irving Kristol and Daniel Bell (subsequently joined by Nathan Glazer)—originally young Trotskyites who had spent their days as students at the City College of New York (CCNY), the “Harvard of the Proletariat”—“trying to understand how the socialist ideal of political and economic justice had ended in Joseph Stalin’s murderous tyranny.”[2] They later migrated to what we would now consider prototypical Roosevelt-cum-Lyndon Johnson liberalism, and then evolved into “neoconservatives.” These three men were becoming iconic public intellectuals, and The Public Interest was something of a personal journal of lessons they learned during their ideological transformation.\n\nKristol and Bell ran a series of evening seminar/workshops here on this campus and at CCNY. At every opportunity, I would take an afternoon off, jump on a bus to New York, attend their evening talks, find some kindly student to let me sleep in a dorm room and return by bus to Washington the next morning. All this is by way of saying that I have been coming to Columbia for over 40 years, almost as many years as the number of consecutive games lost in the historical losing streak of your illustrious football team.\n\nI was especially captivated by Irving Kristol. His book, Two Cheers for Capitalism, praised capitalism because, one, “it works, in a quite simple, material sense;” and two, it is “congenial to a large measure of personal liberty.”[3] Kristol famously described himself as “a liberal who had been mugged by reality.” In writing a loving homage to Kristol when he died, David Brooks of the New York Times summarized the basis for Kristol’s epiphany in more colorful language. “The elemental Jewish commandment” in the working-class neighborhood where Kristol grew up was: “Don’t be a schmuck. Don’t fall for fantastical notions that have nothing to do with the way people really are.”[4]\n\nAs a member of the team of earnest men and women who form the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), I consider myself a central banker who has been mugged by the reality of having been an investor and market operator. I am constantly wary of fantastical notions that seem cogent in economic or monetary theory but run counter to what I learned in the marketplace or run the risk of departing from practice in the real economy—of possibly having nothing to do with the way people and businesses, those who actually operate our economy, really are.\n\nToday, I am going to discuss two such risks as I see them: the current program of quantitative easing and the effect of the Dodd–Frank legislation aimed at preventing “too big to fail.” I’ll do this in short order and as provocatively as possible so as to give professors Calomiris and Svejnar plenty of ammo to use during the inquisition that will follow my remarks.\n\nI have argued against what I have called “Buzz Lightyear” monetary policy—pledging to hold the federal funds rate at zero seemingly to infinity and beyond, while purchasing longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month, reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and purchasing MBS at a pace of $40 billion per month.[5] Indeed, other than our initial program to underpin a recovery in the housing market with our initial tranche of purchases of MBS, I have opposed all other large-scale asset purchases or quantitative easing (QE) programs. Why have I been so obstinate in my opposition to this well-intended program?\n\nI fully understand its theoretical underpinnings. But I question its efficacy.\n\nConfined as the Fed is at the “zero bound,” the only means of adding monetary fuel to the economy has been to purchase Treasury and MBS securities. When we buy something, we pay for it, putting money into the economy. That money—backed by an assurance that the FOMC will hold interest rates at zero and continue large-scale asset purchases for a prolonged period—should, theoretically, be put to use: a) by banks’ lending to consumers and to businesses that will expand employment, or b) by investors who, rediscounting valuations in the fixed-income and equity markets, will drive those markets higher in price, creating a “wealth effect.” This wealth effect should lead to further consumption as well as greater employment by businesses whose balance sheets have been reconfigured and enriched both by the cheapest leverage in American history and by booming prices for their stock.\n\nAll these actions are in keeping with the dual mandate that the Federal Reserve was given by the Congress of the United States. It calls for us to operate independently both to maintain price stability and conduct policy in a way that engenders full employment. Given that inflation and, importantly, inflationary expectations are presently “contained,” it would seem theoretically compelling to pursue the policy that we have undertaken.\n\nBut a not-so-funny thing has happened on the way to the reality forum. While bankers and other sources of credit have slowly but consistently liberalized their lending practices, borrowers have not been especially keen to put cheap and super-abundant credit to use in expanding payrolls to the degree the FOMC desires.\n\nTo be sure, we have, as hoped, seen a reinvigorated housing market. Indeed, FOMC records will show that based on the superb work done by two housing-market experts at the Dallas Fed—John Duca and Anthony Murphy, working with John Muellbauer at Oxford—and thanks to our field soundings with housing and housing-related business leaders, the Dallas Fed was way ahead of others at the FOMC table both in warning of the housing market debacle and then recognizing the housing recovery.[6] The fact that the housing-market gears have now begun to mesh is why I believe we are running the risk of overkill by continuing our mortgage-backed securities purchase program at the current pace and would suggest tapering off those purchases.\n\nAs to the more broadly impactful Treasury purchases, occurring as they have simultaneously with a loss of confidence in the euro bond markets—I like to say that, relatively speaking, the U.S. economy has been the “best-looking horse in the glue factory”—they have indeed led to a massive bond and stock market rally. For the ninth time in U.S. history, we have experienced a doubling of the market indexes; corporate borrowing rates are at the lowest levels on record, including those for CCC-rated credits that are just north of default.\n\nThat’s the good news. Some sharp market operators have done very well. For private-equity firms, for example, hyper-accommodative monetary policy has offered a chance to go back to the glories of payment-in-kind and other financial techniques that enrich financiers but may not create employment. For the largest banks and financial institutions, policy has helped dig them out of the holes in which they found themselves (including the hole of executive compensation). And for the wealthiest investors, even unto the revered Oracle of Omaha, there has been the windfall of super-abundant credit that, after adjusting for tax deductions on interest and a modicum of inflation, is practically free. Ordinary savers and retirees have benefited from the turnaround in the all-important housing sector, but with the remainder of their savings, they have been waylaid on the sidelines of the zero bound. In addition, the 5,500 or so smaller banks that are the backbone of our communities have seen their interest margins squeezed severely. The wealth effect, in other words, has been unbalanced. Main Street does not seem to have been impacted to the same degree as Wall Street.\n\nTo be sure, as mentioned, businesses have been able to improve their balance sheets and are enjoying higher stock market valuations of their businesses. However, thus far, businesses have pursued payroll-expanding job creation with less enthusiasm than had been hoped for. Unemployment remains annoyingly high. There are some pockets of exception like Texas, which now operates at employment levels 3.1 percent above its prerecession peak and, over the last decade, has created jobs across the entire income spectrum. Nationwide, meanwhile, job creation has been weak and in the important middle-income quartiles has been shrinking.\n\nEmployers large and small, privately owned or publicly traded, will tell you that despite access to cheap and abundant capital, they are hesitant to make long-term commitments, including hiring significant numbers of permanent workers. They cite uncertain growth prospects for the goods and services they sell at home, where consumption is retarded by slow growth in employment and, lately, by the increase in payroll taxes. And abroad, these employers point to the dampened consumption stemming from the economic debacle in Europe and its knock-on effects on China and the export-led emerging economies. They are uncertain about fiscal policy, not knowing what their taxes will be and what will happen to all-important federal spending that directly impacts them or their customers. They are uncertain as to the ultimate effect on their cost structures of the seemingly endless expansion of health care and other mandates and regulations, however meritorious their intention. And, for some, there is a deeply imbedded worry that the Fed’s contortion of the yield curve and cost of money cannot last forever, or, if it lasts too long, will eventually result in financial bubbles and/or uncontrollable inflation, adding another uncertainty to the plethora of uncertain factors that already plague them.\n\nAs I walked down memory lane in preparation for this lecture today, I thought of my days at business school in the mid-1970s. Everything we learned in business school was oriented toward operating and growing companies under the assumption of constrained, conservative debt markets and a fundamentals-driven equity market. Today, the opposite obtains: Credit is super-abundant and stock market behavior is conditioned not so much by the fundamental performance of its underlying companies but by increasing doses of monetary Ritalin.[7] Against this backdrop, I am not surprised by the reaction of businesses. Operating in a highly uncertain environment, it is eminently sensible for them to defensively use their newly strengthened balance sheets to buy back shares and pay out dividends or employ them offensively in ways—say, in making acquisitions—that often lead to employee rationalization, not payroll expansion for U.S. workers.\n\nThis is how businesses really think; this is the way people really are.\n\nThe bottom line is that rather than achieve the intended theoretical effect, I believe the policy of super-abundant money at costs deviating substantially from normal equilibrium levels may ultimately prove to be counterproductive. Or it may restrain the benefits that theory might suggest.\n\nIf this is so, should we continue with the current program of QE? I have argued we should not, that we are pushing on a string. But let me qualify this. I was, indeed, against the escalating rounds of QE, questioning their efficacy. But now that we have them in place, and the fixed-income and stock markets are hooked on the monetary Ritalin that we have dispensed in ever-larger doses, it would, in my opinion, do great harm to force a sudden withdrawal. So, I have argued that it would be best to taper the dose of QE so that markets can adjust gradually to the eventual removal of this treatment and return to pricing securities on the basis of fundamentals.\n\nAm I right or wrong? I pose this question to professors Calomiris and Svejnar for the discussion that will follow.\n\nLet me add one more thought for the good professors to contemplate before moving on to the topic of too big to fail (TBTF). This is, admittedly, out of left (or perhaps in the spirit of Irving Kristol, right) field: Having posited that, thus far, the wealth-effect phenomenon has been concentrated in both the housing sector—a Main Street benefit, and a powerful one—and the hands of the savviest operators—those most able to exploit free and abundant money, primarily a smaller base consisting of the big banks and the investment community on Wall Street—and given that private sector job creators are in a defensive crouch and the federal government is likely to remain in cost-containment mode, might there be a way for others charged with fiduciary responsibility to the broader public to capitalize on the current moment?\n\nFor example, Texas, with its highly rated government credit, has navigated its 26 million people through the Great Recession with strong fiscal fundamentals and a dynamic economy that has persistently outperformed the United States and, indeed, all other large states for at least the past two decades.[8] Might it make sense for Texas to issue ultra-long bonds at currently prevailing ultra-low rates to finance the state’s longer-term infrastructure needs? I have in mind a Texas Century Bond. The public benefit would come from saving on interest payments that will inevitably rise over time from their unprecedented low levels—certainly sometime in the next 100 years—meanwhile financing highways, water projects, universities and the like that will be needed to continue serving the state’s growing population and expanding economy. If ever there were a window for such an issuance, it surely would be now.\n\nDomestic entities seeking to match longer-term liabilities and commitments as well as sovereign investors like the Norwegians are keen on finding “risk free” dollar-denominated assets of long duration. Mexico and private universities such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have placed century bonds. Because the U.S. government cannot capitalize on such demand and is stuck in a rut of issuing short-dated debt so as not to add to its deficits, could or should other dollar-based “sovereign” issuers like the best credit-rated states, especially a large one like Texas, do so? I’ll just throw that out for your contemplation.\n\nNow, on to TBTF.\n\nEveryone and their sister knows that financial institutions deemed TBTF were at the epicenter of the 2007–09 financial crisis. Previously thought of as islands of safety in a sea of risk, they became the enablers of a financial tsunami. Now that the storm has subsided, my colleagues at the Dallas Fed and I submit that they are another key reason accommodative monetary policy and government policies have failed to adequately spur the economic recovery. Our research director, Harvey Rosenblum, and I first wrote about this in an article published in the Wall Street Journal in September 2009, titled “The Blob That Ate Monetary Policy.”[9] Put simply, sick banks don’t lend. Sick—seriously undercapitalized—megabanks severely constricted their usual lending and capital-market activities during the crisis and economic recovery. They brought economic growth to a standstill and spread their sickness to the rest of the banking system.\n\nCongress thought it would address the issue of TBTF through the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Preventing TBTF from ever occurring again is in the very preamble of the act. We contend that Dodd–Frank has not done enough to corral TBTF banks and that, on balance, the act has made things worse, not better. We submit that, in the short run, parts of Dodd–Frank have exacerbated the weakness in economic growth by increasing regulatory uncertainty in key sectors of the U.S. economy. Despite its good intention, it has been counterproductive, working against solving the core problems it seeks to address.\n\nLet me define what we mean when we speak of TBTF. The Dallas Fed’s definition is financial firms whose owners, managers, creditors, shareholders and customers believe them to be exempt from the processes of bankruptcy and creative destruction. Such firms capture the financial upside of their actions but largely avoid payment—bankruptcy and closure—for actions gone wrong, in violation of one of the basic tenets of market capitalism (at least as it is supposed to be practiced in the United States). Such firms enjoy implicit subsidies relative to their non-TBTF competitors. They are thus more likely to take greater risks in search of profits, protected by the presumption that bankruptcy is a highly unlikely outcome.\n\nThe phenomenon of TBTF is the result of an implicit but widely taken-for-granted government-sanctioned policy of coming to the aid of a financial institution deemed to be so large, interconnected and/or complex that its failure could substantially damage the financial system. By reducing a TBTF firm’s exposure to losses from excessive risk taking, such policies undermine the discipline that market forces normally assert on management decisionmaking.\n\nThe reduction of market discipline has been further eroded by implicit extensions of the federal safety net beyond commercial banks to their nonbank affiliates. Moreover, industry consolidation, fostered by subsidized growth (and during the crisis, encouraged by the federal government in the acquisitions of Merrill Lynch, Bear Stearns, Washington Mutual and Wachovia), has perpetuated and enlarged the weight of financial firms deemed TBTF. This reduces competition.\n\nDodd–Frank does not do enough to constrain the behemoth banks’ advantages. Indeed, given the economies of scale in handling regulation, Dodd–Frank’s excessive complexity works to undermine the competitiveness of smaller banks, thereby offsetting some of the act’s other aspects that curtail TBTF banks’ dominance. It unwittingly exacerbates the problem it set out to solve.\n\nAndrew Haldane, the highly respected member of the Financial Policy Committee of the Bank of England, addressed this at last summer’s Jackson Hole, Wyo., policymakers’ meeting in witty remarks titled, “The Dog and the Frisbee.”[10] I highly recommend this speech to you.\n\nHaldane noted that Dodd–Frank comes against a backdrop of ever-greater escalation of financial regulation. He pointed out that nationally chartered banks began to file the antecedents of “call reports” after the formation of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in 1863. The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 required state-chartered member banks to do the same, having them submitted to the Federal Reserve starting in 1917. They were short forms; in 1930, Haldane noted, these reports numbered 80 entries. “In 1986, [the ‘call reports’ submitted by bank holding companies] covered 547 columns in Excel; by 1999, 1,208 columns. By 2011 … 2,271 columns.” “Fortunately,” he added wryly, “Excel had expanded sufficiently to capture the increase.”\n\nThough this increasingly complex reporting failed to prevent detection of the seeds of the debacle of 2007–09, Dodd–Frank has layered on copious amounts of new complexity. The legislation has 16 titles and runs 848 pages. It spawns litter upon litter of regulations: More than 8,800 pages of regulations have already been proposed, and the process is not yet done.\n\nIn his speech, Haldane noted—conservatively, in my view—that a survey of the Federal Register showed that complying with these new rules would require 2,260,631 labor hours each year. He added: “Of course, the costs of this regulatory edifice would be considered small if they delivered even modest improvements to regulators’ ability to avert future crises.” He went on to argue the wick is not worth the candle, before concluding: “Modern finance is complex, perhaps too complex. Regulation of modern finance is complex, almost certainly too complex. That configuration spells trouble. As you do not fight fire with fire, you do not fight complexity with complexity. [The situation] requires a regulatory response grounded in simplicity, not complexity.”\n\nThis case for more effectively treating TBTF is especially compelling given the subsidy these institutions now enjoy by virtue of their protected status.\n\nThis TBTF subsidy is quite large and has risen after the financial crisis. Recent estimates by the Bank for International Settlements, for example, suggest that the implicit government guarantee provides the largest U.S. bank holding companies with an average credit rating uplift of more than two notches, thereby lowering average funding costs a full percentage point relative to smaller competitors.[11] Our aforementioned friend, Andy Haldane, estimates the implicit TBTF global subsidy to be roughly $300 billion per year for the 29 global institutions identified by the Financial Stability Board (2011) as “systemically important.”[12] To put that $300 billion estimated annual subsidy in perspective, all the U.S. bank holding companies summed together reported 2011 earnings of $108 billion.\n\nHarvey Rosenblum and I, and our team at the Dallas Fed, have proposed a simple amendment to Dodd–Frank to remedy the TBTF pathology. We would eliminate the mumbo-jumbo, ineffective and costly complexity of the law; relieve the regulatory imposition it imposes on non-TBTF banks that do not pose systemic or broad risk to the economy or financial system; and eliminate the unfair subsidy the TBTF holding companies enjoy at the expense of their smaller competitors. Our proposal would effectively level the playing field for all banking organizations and provide better protection for taxpaying citizens.\n\nI laid our proposal out in a speech in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 16. You might access it and study its details.[13] In a nutshell, we recommend that within a complex bank holding company, only the commercial banking operations that intermediate short-term deposits into longer-term loans would benefit from federal deposit insurance and access to the Federal Reserve’s discount window. All other operations of a complex bank holding company and all “shadow banking” affiliates of that company would not have this protection or access to the Fed’s window. To reinforce the understanding that taxpayers will not come to the aid of the risks taken by those entities, every customer, creditor and counterparty of every shadow-banking affiliate and of the senior holding company would be required to sign a new covenant, a simple disclosure that need be no more complex than this: “Conducting business with this affiliate of XYZ bank holding company carries NO federal deposit insurance or other government protection or guarantees. The counterparty herein fully understands that in conducting business with XYZ’s banking affiliate, it has NO federal government protection or guarantees, and its investment is totally at risk.”\n\nUnfortunately, established customer relationships are slow to change. To accelerate the transition to a more competitive financial system, our proposal has a third element to help level the playing field. Specifically, we recommend that the largest financial institutions be restructured so that every one of their corporate entities is subject to a speedy bankruptcy process, and in the case of banking entities, that each be of a size that is “too small to save.” This would underscore to customers and creditors that a credible regime shift has taken place, and the reign of TBTF policies is over.\n\nTo circle back to Irving Kristol, I believe this suggested remedy to the pathology of TBTF “works, in a quite simple, material sense” and is “congenial to a large measure of personal liberty.” It most certainly dispenses with fantastical notions of the way people really are.\n\nI have thrown a lot at you in this long speech. Thank you for tolerating me. Now, in the best tradition of central bankers, I will do my utmost to avoid answering any questions you and the good professors present may ask.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "January 16, 2013 Washington, D.C.\n\nIt is an honor to be introduced by my college classmate, John Henry. John is a descendant of the iconic patriot, Patrick Henry. Most of John’s ancestors were prominent colonial Virginians and many were anti-crown. Patrick, however, was the most outspoken. Ask John why this was so, and he will answer: “Patrick was poor.”\n\nHowever poor he may have been, Patrick Henry was a rich orator. In one of his greatest speeches, he said: “Different men often see the same subject in different lights; and therefore, I hope that it will not be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen if, entertaining as I do, opinions of a character very opposite to theirs, I shall speak forth my sentiments freely, and without reserve. This is no time for ceremony … [it] is one of awful moment to this country.”\n\nPatrick Henry was addressing the repression of the American colonies by the British crown. Tonight, I wish to speak to a different kind of repression—the injustice of being held hostage to large financial institutions considered “too big to fail,” or TBTF for short.\n\nI submit that these institutions, as a result of their privileged status, exact an unfair tax upon the American people. Moreover, they interfere with the transmission of monetary policy and inhibit the advancement of our nation’s economic prosperity.\n\nI have spoken of this for several years, beginning with a speech on the “Pathology of Too-Big-to-Fail” in July 2009.[1] My colleague, Harvey Rosenblum—a highly respected economist and the Dallas Fed’s director of research—and I and our staff have written about it extensively. Tomorrow, we will issue a special report that further elucidates our proposal for dealing with the pathology of TBTF. It also addresses the superior relative performance of community banks during the recent crisis and how they are being victimized by excessive regulation that stems from responses to the sins of their behemoth counterparts. I urge all of you to read that report.[2]\n\nNow, Federal Reserve convention requires that I issue a disclaimer here: I speak only for the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, not for others associated with our central bank. That is usually abundantly clear. In many matters, my staff and I entertain opinions that are very different from those of many of our esteemed colleagues elsewhere in the Federal Reserve System. Today, I “speak forth my sentiments freely and without reserve” on the issue of TBTF, while meaning no disrespect to others who may hold different views.\n\nEveryone and their sister knows that financial institutions deemed too big to fail were at the epicenter of the 2007–09 financial crisis. Previously thought of as islands of safety in a sea of risk, they became the enablers of a financial tsunami. Now that the storm has subsided, we submit that they are a key reason accommodative monetary policy and government policies have failed to adequately affect the economic recovery. Harvey Rosenblum and I first wrote about this in an article published in the Wall Street Journal in September 2009, “The Blob That Ate Monetary Policy.”[3] Put simply, sick banks don’t lend. Sick—seriously undercapitalized—megabanks stopped their lending and capital market activities during the crisis and economic recovery. They brought economic growth to a standstill and spread their sickness to the rest of the banking system.\n\nCongress thought it would address the issue of TBTF through the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Preventing TBTF from ever occurring again is in the very preamble of the act. We contend that Dodd–Frank has not done enough to corral TBTF banks and that, on balance, the act has made things worse, not better. We submit that, in the short run, parts of Dodd–Frank have exacerbated weak economic growth by increasing regulatory uncertainty in key sectors of the U.S. economy. It has clearly benefited many lawyers and created new layers of bureaucracy. Despite its good intention, it has been counterproductive, working against solving the core problem it seeks to address.\n\nLet me define what we mean when we speak of TBTF. The Dallas Fed’s definition is financial firms whose owners, managers and customers believe themselves to be exempt from the processes of bankruptcy and creative destruction. Such firms capture the financial upside of their actions but largely avoid payment—bankruptcy and closure—for actions gone wrong, in violation of one of the basic tenets of market capitalism (at least as it is supposed to be practiced in the United States). Such firms enjoy subsidies relative to their non-TBTF competitors. They are thus more likely to take greater risks in search of profits, protected by the presumption that bankruptcy is a highly unlikely outcome.\n\nThe phenomenon of TBTF is the result of an implicit but widely taken-for-granted government-sanctioned policy of coming to the aid of the owners, managers and creditors of a financial institution deemed to be so large, interconnected and/or complex that its failure could substantially damage the financial system. By reducing a TBTF firm’s exposure to losses from excessive risk taking, such policies undermine the discipline that market forces normally assert on management decisionmaking.\n\nThe reduction of market discipline has been further eroded by implicit extensions of the federal safety net beyond commercial banks to their nonbank affiliates. Moreover, industry consolidation, fostered by subsidized growth (and during the crisis, encouraged by the federal government in the acquisitions of Merrill Lynch, Bear Stearns, Washington Mutual and Wachovia), has perpetuated and enlarged the weight of financial firms deemed TBTF. This reduces competition in lending.\n\nDodd–Frank does not do enough to constrain the behemoth banks’ advantages. Indeed, given its complexity, it unwittingly exacerbates them.\n\nAndrew Haldane, the highly respected member of the Financial Policy Committee of the Bank of England, addressed this at last summer’s Jackson Hole, Wyo., policymakers’ meeting in witty remarks titled, “The Dog and the Frisbee.”[4] Here are some choice passages from that noteworthy speech.\n\nHaldane notes that regulators’ “… efforts to catch the crisis Frisbee have continued to escalate. Casual empiricism reveals an ever-growing number of regulators … Ever-larger litters have not, however, obviously improved the watchdogs’ Frisbee-catching abilities. [After all,] no regulator had the foresight to predict the financial crisis, although some have since exhibited supernatural powers of hindsight.\n\n“So what is the secret of the watchdogs’ failure? The answer is simple. Or rather, it is complexity … complex regulation … might not just be costly and cumbersome but sub-optimal. … In financial regulation, less may be more.”\n\nOne is reminded of the comment French Prime Minister Clemenceau made about President Wilson’s 14 points: “Why 14?” he asked. “God did it in 10.”\n\nWere that we only had 14 points of financial regulation to contend with today. Haldane notes that Dodd–Frank comes against a background of ever-greater escalation of financial regulation. He points out that nationally chartered banks began to file the antecedents of “call reports” after the formation of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in 1863. The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 required state-chartered member banks to do the same, having them submitted to the Federal Reserve starting in 1917. They were short forms; in 1930, Haldane noted, these reports numbered 80 entries. “In 1986, [the ‘call reports’ submitted by bank holding companies] covered 547 columns in Excel, by 1999, 1,208 columns. By 2011 … 2,271 columns.” “Fortunately,” he adds wryly, “Excel had expanded sufficiently to capture the increase.”\n\nThough this growingly complex reporting failed to prevent detection of the seeds of the debacle of 2007–09, Dodd–Frank has layered on copious amounts of new complexity. The legislation has 16 titles and runs 848 pages. It spawns litter upon litter of regulations: More than 8,800 pages of regulations have already been proposed, and the process is not yet done. In his speech, Haldane noted—conservatively, in my view—that a survey of the Federal Register showed that complying with these new rules would require 2,260,631 labor hours each year. He added: “Of course, the costs of this regulatory edifice would be considered small if they delivered even modest improvements to regulators’ ability to avert future crises.” He then goes on to argue the wick is not worth the candle. And he concludes: “Modern finance is complex, perhaps too complex. Regulation of modern finance is complex, almost certainly too complex. That configuration spells trouble. As you do not fight fire with fire, you do not fight complexity with complexity. [The situation] requires a regulatory response grounded in simplicity, not complexity. Delivering that would require an about-turn.”\n\nThe Dallas Fed’s proposal offers an “about-turn” and a way to mend the flaws in Dodd–Frank. It fights unnecessary complexity with simplicity where appropriate. It eliminates much of the mumbo-jumbo, ineffective, costly complexity of Dodd–Frank. Of note, it would be especially helpful to non-TBTF banks that do not pose systemic or broad risk to the economy or the financial system. Our proposal would relieve small banks of some unnecessary burdens arising from Dodd–Frank that unfairly penalize them. Our proposal would effectively level the playing field for all banking organizations in the country and provide the best protection for taxpaying citizens.\n\nIn a nutshell, we recommend that TBTF financial institutions be restructured into multiple business entities. Only the resulting downsized commercial banking operations—and not shadow banking affiliates or the parent company—would benefit from the safety net of federal deposit insurance and access to the Federal Reserve’s discount window.\n\nIt is important to have an accurate view of the landscape of banking today in order to understand the impact of this proposal.\n\nAs of third quarter 2012, there were approximately 5,600 commercial banking organizations in the U.S. The bulk of these—roughly 5,500—were community banks with assets of less than $10 billion. These community-focused organizations accounted for 98.6 percent of all banks but only 12 percent of total industry assets. Another group numbering nearly 70 banking organizations—with assets of between $10 billion and $250 billion—accounted for 1.2 percent of banks, while controlling 19 percent of industry assets. The remaining group, the megabanks—with assets of between $250 billion and $2.3 trillion—was made up of a mere 12 institutions. These dozen behemoths accounted for roughly 0.2 percent of all banks, but they held 69 percent of industry assets.\n\n\n\nSOURCES: Call reports (Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council); FR Y-9C filers (National Information Center, Federal Reserve System).\n\nThe 12 institutions that presently account for 69 percent of total industry assets are candidates to be considered TBTF because of the threat they could pose to the financial system and the economy should one or more of them get into trouble. By contrast, should any of the other 99.8 percent of banking institutions get into trouble, the matter most likely would be settled with private-sector ownership changes and minimal governmental intervention.\n\nHow and why does this work for 99.8 percent but not the other 0.2 percent?\n\nTo answer this question, it helps to consider the sources of regulatory and market discipline imposed on each of the three groups of banks.\n\nLet’s look at two dimensions of regulatory discipline: Potential closure of the institution and the effectiveness of supervisory pressure on bank management practices.\n\nDo the owners and managers of a banking institution operate with the belief that their institution is subject to a bankruptcy process that works reasonably quickly to transfer ownership and control to another banking entity or entities? Is there a group of interested and involved shareholders that can exert a restraining force on franchise-threatening risk taking by the bank’s top management team? Can management be replaced and ownership value wiped out? Is the firm controlled de facto by its owners, or instead effectively management-controlled?[5] In addition, we ask: To what extent do uninsured creditors of the banking entity impose risk-management discipline on management?\n\nThis analytical framework is summarized in the following slide:\n\n\n\nSOURCE: Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nLooking across line 1, it is clear that community banks are subject to considerable regulatory and shareholder discipline. They can and do fail. In the last few years, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) has built a reputation for regulators carrying out Joseph Schumpeter’s concept of “creative destruction” by taking over small banks on a Friday evening and reopening them on Monday morning under new ownership. “In on Friday, out by Monday” is the mantra of this process.\n\nKnowing the power of banking supervisors to close the institution, owners and managers of community banks heed supervisory suggestions to limit risk. Community banks often have a few significant shareholders who have a considerable portion of their wealth tied to the fate of the bank. Consequently, they exert substantial control over the behavior of management because risk and potential closure matter to them. Since community banks derive the bulk of their funding from federally insured deposits, they are simple rather than complex in their capital structure and rarely have uninsured and unsecured creditors. “Market discipline” over management practices is primarily exerted through shareholders.\n\nOf the three groups, the 70 regional and moderate-sized banking organizations depicted in line 2 are subject to a broader range of market discipline. Like community banks, these institutions are not exempt from the bankruptcy process; they can and do fail. But given their size, complexity and generally larger geographic footprint, the failure resolution and ownership transfer processes cannot always be accomplished over a weekend. In practice, owners and managers of mid-sized institutions are nonetheless aware of the downside consequences of the risks taken by the institution. Uninsured depositors and unsecured creditors are also aware of their unprotected status in the event the institution experiences financial difficulties. Mid-sized banking institutions receive a good dose of external discipline from both supervisors and market-based signals.\n\nTBTF megabanks, depicted in line 3, receive far too little regulatory and market discipline. This is unfortunate because their failure, if it were allowed, could disrupt financial markets and the economy. For all intents and purposes, we believe that TBTF banks have not been allowed to fail outright.[6] Knowing this, the management of TBTF banks can, to a large extent, choose to resist the advice and guidance of their bank supervisors’ efforts to impose regulatory discipline. And for TBTF banks, the forces of market discipline from shareholders and unsecured creditors are limited.\n\nLet’s first consider discipline from shareholders. Having millions of stockholders has diluted shareholders’ ability to prevent the management of TBTF banks from pursuing corporate strategies that are profitable for management, though not necessarily for shareholders.\n\nAs we learned during the crisis, adverse information on poor financial performance often is available too late for shareholder reaction or credit default swap (CDS) spreads to have any impact on management behavior. For example, during the financial crisis, shares in two of the largest bank holding companies (BHCs) declined more than 95 percent from their prior peak prices and their CDS spreads went haywire.[7] The ratings agencies eventually reacted, in keeping with their tendency to be reactive rather than proactive. But the damage from excessive risk taking had already been done. And after the crisis? Judging from the behavior of many of the largest BHCs, with limited exception, efforts by shareholders of these institutions to meaningfully influence management compensation practices have been slow in coming. So much for shareholder discipline as a check on TBTF banks.\n\nUnfortunately, TBTF banks also do not face much external discipline from unsecured creditors. An important facet of TBTF is that the funding sources for megabanks extend far beyond insured deposits, as referenced by my mention of CDS spreads. The largest banks, not just the TBTF banks, fund themselves with a wide range of liabilities. These include large, negotiable CDs, which often exceed the FDIC insurance limit; federal funds purchased from other banks, all of which are uninsured, and subordinated notes and bonds, generally unsecured. It is not unusual for such uninsured/unsecured liabilities to account for well over half the liabilities of TBTF institutions. If market discipline were to be imposed on TBTF institutions, one would expect it to come from uninsured/unsecured depositors, creditors and debt holders. But TBTF status exerts perverse market discipline on the risk-taking activities of these banks. Unsecured creditors recognize the implicit government guarantee of TBTF banks’ liabilities. As a result, unsecured depositors and creditors offer their funds at a lower cost to TBTF banks than to mid-sized and regional banks that face the risk of failure.\n\nThis TBTF subsidy is quite large and has risen following the financial crisis. Recent estimates by the Bank for International Settlements, for example, suggest that the implicit government guarantee provides the largest U.S. BHCs with an average credit rating uplift of more than two notches, thereby lowering average funding costs a full percentage point relative to their smaller competitors.[8] Our aforementioned friend from the Bank of England, Andrew Haldane, estimates the current implicit TBTF global subsidy to be roughly $300 billion per year for the 29 global institutions identified by the Financial Stability Board (2011) as “systemically important.”[9] To put that $300 billion estimated annual subsidy in perspective, all the U.S. BHCs summed together reported 2011 earnings of $108 billion.\n\nAdd to that the burdens stemming from the complexity of TBTF banks. Here is the basic organization diagram for a typical complex financial holding company:\n\n\n\nSOURCE: Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nTo simplify a complex issue, one might consider all the operations other than the commercial banking operation as shadow banking affiliates, including any special investment vehicles—or SIVs—of the commercial bank [10].\n\nNow, consider this table. It gives you a sense of the size and scope of some of the five largest BHCs, noting their nondeposit liabilities in billions of dollars and their number of total subsidiaries and countries of operation (according to the Financial Stability Oversight Council):\n\n\n\nSOURCES: \"Which Banks Could Face Cap on Size?\" by Victoria McGrane, Wall Street Journal, Oct. 11, 2012; Financial Stability Oversight Council.\n\nFor perspective, consider the sad case of Lehman Brothers. More than four years later, the Lehman bankruptcy is still not completely resolved. As of its 10-K regulatory filing in 2007, Lehman operated a mere 209 subsidiaries across only 21 countries and had total liabilities of $619 billion. By these metrics, Lehman was a small player compared with any of the Big Five. If Lehman Brothers was too big for a private-sector solution while still a going concern, what can we infer about the Big Five in the table?\n\nDodd–Frank addresses this concern. Under the Orderly Liquidation Authority provisions of Dodd–Frank, a systemically important financial institution would receive debtor-in-possession financing from the U.S. Treasury over the period its operations needed to be stabilized. This is quasi-nationalization, just in a new, and untested, format. In Dallas, we consider government ownership of our financial institutions, even on a “temporary” basis, to be a clear distortion of our capitalist principles. Of course, an alternative would be to have another systemically important financial institution acquire the failing institution. We have been down that road already. All it does is compound the problem, expanding the risk posed by the even larger surviving behemoth organizations. In addition, perpetuating the practice of arranging shotgun marriages between giants at taxpayer expense worsens the funding disadvantage faced by the 99.8 percent remaining—small and regional banks. Merging large institutions is a form of discrimination that favors the unwieldy and dangerous TBTF banks over more focused, fit and disciplined banks.\n\nThe approach of the Dallas Fed neither expands the reach of government nor further handicaps the 99.8 percent of community and regional banks. Nor does it fight complexity with complexity.\n\nIt calls for reshaping TBTF banking institutions into smaller, less-complex institutions that are: economically viable; profitable; competitively able to attract financial capital and talent; and of a size, complexity and scope that allows both regulatory and market discipline to restrain excessive risk taking.\n\nOur proposal is simple and easy to understand. It can be accomplished with minimal statutory modification and implemented with as little government intervention as possible. It calls first for rolling back the federal safety net to apply only to basic, traditional commercial banking. Second, it calls for clarifying, through simple, understandable disclosures, that the federal safety net applies only to the commercial bank and its customers and never ever to the customers of any other affiliated subsidiary or the holding company. The shadow banking activities of financial institutions must not receive taxpayer support.\n\nWe recognize that undoing customer inertia and management habits at TBTF banking institutions may take many years. During such a period, TBTF banks could possibly sow the seeds for another financial crisis. For these reasons, additional action may be necessary. The TBTF BHCs may need to be downsized and restructured so that the safety-net-supported commercial banking part of the holding company can be effectively disciplined by regulators and market forces. And there will likely have to be additional restrictions (or possibly prohibitions) on the ability to move assets or liabilities from a shadow banking affiliate to a banking affiliate within the holding company.[11]\n\nTo illustrate how the first two points in our plan would work, I come back to the hypothetical structure of a complex financial holding company. Recall that this type of holding company has a commercial bank subsidiary and several subsidiaries that are not traditional commercial banks: insurance, securities underwriting and brokerage, finance company and others, many with a vast geographic reach.\n\nUnder our proposal, only the commercial bank would have access to deposit insurance provided by the FDIC and discount window loans provided by the Federal Reserve. These two features of the safety net would explicitly, by statute, become unavailable to any shadow banking affiliate, special investment vehicle of the commercial bank or any obligations of the parent holding company. This is largely the current case—but in theory, not in practice. And consistent enforcement is viewed as unlikely.\n\n\n\nSOURCE: Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nTo reinforce the statute and its credibility, every customer, creditor and counterparty of every shadow banking affiliate and of the senior holding company would be required to agree to and sign a new covenant, a simple disclosure statement that acknowledges their unprotected status. A sample disclosure need be no more complex than this:\n\n\n\nThis two-part step should begin to remove the implicit TBTF subsidy provided to BHCs and their shadow banking operations. Entities other than commercial banks have inappropriately benefited from an implicit safety net. Our proposal promotes competition in light of market and regulatory discipline, replacing the status quo of subsidized and perverse incentives to take excessive risk.\n\nAs indicated earlier, some government intervention may be necessary to accelerate the imposition of effective market discipline. We believe that market forces should be relied upon as much as practicable. However, entrenched oligopoly forces, in combination with customer inertia, will likely only be overcome through government-sanctioned reorganization and restructuring of the TBTF BHCs. A subsidy once given is nearly impossible to take away. Thus, it appears we may need a push, using as little government intervention as possible to realign incentives, reestablish a competitive landscape and level the playing field.\n\nMy team at the Dallas Fed and I are confident this simple treatment to the complex problem and risks posed by TBTF institutions would be the most effective treatment. Think about it this way: At present, 99.8 percent of the banking organizations in America are subject to sufficient regulatory or shareholder/market discipline to contain the risk of misbehavior that could threaten the stability of the financial system. Zero-point-two percent are not. Their very existence threatens both economic and financial stability. Furthermore, to contain that risk, regulators and many small banks are tied up in regulatory and legal knots at an enormous direct cost to them and a large indirect cost to our economy. Zero-point-two percent. If the administration and the Congress could agree as recently as two weeks ago on legislation that affects 1 percent of taxpayers, surely it can process a solution that affects 0.2 percent of the nation’s banks and is less complex and far more effective than Dodd–Frank.\n\nThe time has come to change the decisionmaking paradigm. There should be more than the present two solutions: bailout or the end-of-the-economic-world-as-we-have-known-it. Both choices are unacceptable. The next financial crisis could cost more than two years of economic output, borne by millions of U.S. taxpayers. That horrendous cost must be weighed against the supposed benefits of maintaining the TBTF status quo. To us, the remedy is obvious: end TBTF now. End TBTF by reintroducing market forces instead of complex rules, and in so doing, level the playing field for all banking institutions.\n\nI return to Patrick Henry. He noted that “it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope. We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the song of that siren till she transforms us.” We labor under the siren song of Dodd–Frank and the recent run-up in the pricing of TBTF bank stocks and credit, indulging in the illusion of hope that this complex legislation will end too big to fail and right the banking system. We shut our eyes to the painful truth that TBTF represents an ongoing danger not just to financial stability, but also to fair competition.\n\nThe Dallas Fed offers a modest but, we believe, far more effective fix to Dodd–Frank. This plan is not without its costs. But it is less costly than all the alternatives put forward and it seriously reduces the likelihood of another horrendous and costly financial crisis.\n\nThis need not be a time of “awful moment.” It should instead be a time of promise. Treating the pathology of TBTF now would be a big step toward a more stable and prosperous economic system, one that relies on fundamental principles of capitalism rather than regulatory complexity and increasing government intervention.\n\nThank you.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "December 18, 2012 Gainesville, Texas\n\nTexas continued its strong pace of economic expansion and job growth in 2012. The Dallas Fed expects the state to post real gross domestic product growth of at least 3.5 percent and job growth of 3.2 percent for the year. An uninformed observer might think the jobs created in Texas are primarily low wage. But the attached job-growth data from Dallas Fed Senior Economist Pia Orrenius show that over the past decade, Texas has led the nation in job creation in all four income quartiles. We do create more low-wage jobs; we also create more high-wage jobs. And, importantly, while the growth rate for middle-income jobs over the past decade has been negative in the U.S., it has been positive in Texas. Middle-income jobs may be declining and &quot;job polarization&quot; may be occurring in the U.S., but the same is not true for Texas, where the middle-income population is expanding.\n\nToday's Wall Street Journal notes that, according to the highly regarded analyst Ed Yardini, through September American companies bought $274 billion more shares than they issued. Since September, hardly a trading day goes by without a company announcing a new debt offering to take advantage of today's historically low interest rates to finance further share buybacks and/or special dividend payouts. Too little of this money is being used to invest in job creation and job-creating expansion of plant and equipment in the U.S. Which raises a question about the efficacy of our accommodative monetary policy: Are our massive purchases of Treasury notes and bonds effective in meeting our mandate of conducting monetary policy so as to create maximum employment?\n\nThe answer is, quantitative easing is a necessary but insufficient tool to spark job creation. Employers will not deploy the cheap and abundant capital on hand toward job creation while there is so much uncertainty surrounding final demand for the goods and services they sell. Or the uncertainty surrounding the fiscal cliff: Until they know what their taxes will be or how federal spending patterns that affect them and their customers will change (or, one might add, whether the nation will have a more rational regulatory structure), they will sit on their abundant money rather than spend it on unemployment-reducing expansion.\n\nLet me use a little animal husbandry to illustrate this point.\n\nWe have a ranch in Franklin County in East Texas. We have a 2,200-pound bull there that breeds our Longhorn cows. His name, incidentally, is &quot;Too Big to Fail.&quot;\n\nNow, Too Big has plenty of liquidity at his disposal; he's fully equipped to do what we want him to do. But if we put him on the opposite side of the fence from those pretty cows, he's unable to perform. Think of the uncertainty I've just spoken of, and especially the uncertainty surrounding the resolution of the fiscal cliff, as a fence. Businesses, just like Too Big, have plenty of liquidity; they have the resources they need to do what we want them to do&mdash;in this case, invest in job creation. But as long as that fence of uncertainty is in place, they will not be able to perform.\n\nThis is one of the key reasons that our political authorities must resolve how they will tax and spend going forward and do so in a way that incentivizes American businesses to breed more American jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the full presentation for more data.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "November 15, 2012 Stanford, California\n\nThank you, John [Shoven].\n\nI am delighted to be back on the Stanford campus, where after wandering in the cold, forbidding pedagogical climes of Harvard and Oxford, I finally came to the student nirvana of the Stanford Business School. It was here where I was taken under the wings of intellectual giants such as Lee Bach, Alain Enthoven, Jack McDonald, Bill Sharpe and others, whose devotion to teaching was equal to their scholarly accomplishments.\n\nI should note that, despite my having taken a degree here, the Graduate School of Business has gone on to be ranked first or close to first among business schools in America and the world by most all who compile such metrics. Particularly important to me, in 2011 the Aspen Institute ranked Stanford No. 1 worldwide for incorporating issues concerning social and environmental stewardship into its curriculum.[1] Indeed, as I see it, the tradeoffs that one has to manage between fiscal responsibility and social and environmental stewardship are at the nexus of the potential and of the problems confronting the West today.\n\nBefore addressing the state of the West, however, I want to say that I am humbled to have been asked to follow George Shultz on this program. I can’t think of any living individual—or many in the history of our country—who have served in as many cabinet and senior policy posts, and have done so with such distinction and integrity, as George. We can all tell many stories about George Shultz. My favorite dates to 1971, when he was director of the Office of Management and Budget during the Nixon administration. George had assumed the office just as federal government outlays had for the first time in American history exceeded $200 billion, with the deficit for fiscal year 1971 set to come in at a startling $23 billion, or 2.1 percent of our nation’s gross domestic product.\n\nAlarmed at this development, George called into his office the venerable Sam Cohen—a living encyclopedia of U.S. budgetary history—and asked, “Between you and me, Sam, is there really any difference between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to spending money?” Cohen’s reply was classic: “Sir, there is only one difference: Democrats enjoy it more.”\n\nI am a central banker. I checked partisanship at the door when I joined the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas seven years ago and haven’t looked back. During today’s brief comments and in the Q&A session that follows, I will refrain from talking about politics per se. This is despite the fact that, presently, everyone and their brother wants to discuss the aftermath of the recent elections and speculation about who will do what to whom in addressing the fiscal cliff and the upcoming debt ceiling.\n\nI’ll just say this: Our Congress—past and present—has behaved disgracefully in discharging its fiscal duty. Its members have not shown themselves to be true born leaders. We all know it is far past due for our federal politicians—Democrats who may “enjoy it more” and Republicans who are distinguished only by that single difference—to begin acting like the responsible fiduciaries of the nation’s fiscal accounts they are supposed to be, rather than as the parasitic wastrels they have unwittingly let themselves become.\n\nIn his terrific new book, Ike’s Bluff, Evan Thomas writes that in President Eisenhower’s farewell address from the White House, he warned, “We cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without risking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage. We want democracy to survive for all generations to come.”[2]\n\nThe jig is up. Our fiscal authorities have mortgaged the material assets of our grandchildren to the nth degree. We are at risk of losing our political heritage of reaching across the aisle to work for the common good. In the minds of many, our government’s fiscal misfeasance threatens the world’s respect for America as the beacon of democracy.\n\nOnly the Congress of the United States can now save us from fiscal perdition. The Federal Reserve cannot. The Federal Reserve has been carrying the ball for the fiscal authorities by holding down interest rates in an attempt to stoke the recovery while the fiscal authorities wrestle themselves off the mat. But there are limits to what a monetary authority can do. For the central bank also plays a fiduciary role for the American people and, given our franchise as the globe’s premier reserve currency, the world. We dare not become the central bank counterpart to Congress by adopting a Buzz Lightyear approach of “To infinity and beyond!” by endlessly purchasing U.S. Treasuries and agency debt so as to encumber future generations of central bankers with Hobson’s choices when it comes to undoing what seems contemporarily appropriate.\n\nSo my only comment today regarding the recent federal elections is this: Pray that the president and the Congress will at last tackle the fiscal imbroglio they and their predecessors created and only they can undo. And if our nation’s authorities need to draft George Shultz back into service to get the job done, I am all for sending the young man back to Washington.\n\nAnd now, to address the state of the West. The invitation for this symposium notes that, “the American West is the most dynamic region in the nation.” It goes on to posit that “The Western United States has been the source of innovation and growth and can be an engine of economic recovery.” (Italics mine)\n\nIt is noteworthy that the latter sentence confidently refers to the past—“has been”—but is somewhat conditional looking to the future, using “can be” in asserting our role as an engine of recovery.\n\nTo understand the present West, I thought it would be worthwhile to look at some graphs and trends. For the West is a many-splendored thing. Parts of it are, indeed “dynamic”; other parts are languishing. Parts are indeed engines of growth; others are sputtering and in decline, detracting from the economic recovery.\n\nFor the purpose of this conference, the organizers define the West as encompassing the Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh and Twelfth Federal Reserve districts—specifically the states and territories where the Federal Reserve’s business is administered by the Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco Federal Reserve banks.[3]\n\n\n\nAs you know, when it comes to monetary policy, the Federal Reserve banks and the Board of Governors labor under a dual mandate: We conduct policy with an obligation to preserve price stability and to engender full employment. Given that, at present, inflation and inflationary expectations are tame but the nation is beset by un- and underemployment of disproportionate size, I thought we might look at trends in employment in assessing just how dynamic the West really is as an engine of economic prosperity. A job, after all, is the source of income and the root of security and wealth for a productive people: Without income a person cannot consume and invest, engaging the driving engines of economic growth. Most importantly, a job is the route to dignity as we have historically defined it in America.\n\nThe West as delineated by the four Federal Reserve Districts has indeed been the engine of economic growth for the nation, as evident in this graph that charts nonagricultural employment going back 22 years:\n\n\n\nIt is fair to say that in terms of job creation, the West is the best compared to all the rest and has compensated for the underperformance of the East. As the chart shows, the rate of job creation in the Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh and Twelfth Federal Reserve districts has outpaced that of all the other eight Federal Reserve districts combined since 1997.\n\nIf you break employment growth down by Federal Reserve District, the employment dynamic since 1990 looks like this:\n\n\n\nThe four Federal Reserve Districts that define the West, plus the areas covered by the Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta and Richmond, have each outperformed the nation in job creation. Of note to those who might later read this speech in Gotham and remain devotees of the perspective captured by Saul Steinberg’s iconic “View of the World from Ninth Avenue” cover of The New Yorker, this graph does not present a happy picture: Total employment growth in the Empire State over the 22-year period has been 6 percent, a compound annual growth rate of 0.26 percent, one-eighth that of Texas over the same period.\n\nIf you zoom in on the employment dynamics that have ensued with the onset of the financial crisis, you begin to see important disparities in employment growth within the West.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dallas Fed’s district is the only one to have punched through employment levels that prevailed at the end of 2007. The Minneapolis and Kansas City districts rank second and fourth in post-recession performance, while employment within the San Francisco Federal Reserve District has failed to recover with the same vigor.\n\nA more revealing divergence is evident when you go back to 1990 and plot employment growth of individual states, rather than Federal Reserve districts. For illustrative purposes, and because they bear a disproportionate weight, covering almost 30 percent of the nation’s population and over 75 percent of the West’s, I am going to focus on the specifics of the Eleventh and Twelfth Federal Reserve districts—the areas covered by the Dallas Fed and the San Francisco Fed.\n\nThe Eleventh District covers 27 million people living in Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico. Over 96 percent of the output of the Dallas Federal Reserve District is produced by the 26 million people of one state, Texas. By contrast, California accounts for 61 percent of the San Francisco Fed’s district output and 37 million souls, or roughly 58 percent of the district’s estimated population of 64 million. The remainder of the district’s output and population is spread across eight states: Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington (plus three Pacific territories).\n\nOver the past 22 years, Texas has grown employment at an average annual rate of 2 percent. It has been bettered by Nevada at an average annual growth rate of 2.8 percent, Utah at 2.6 percent, Arizona at 2.4 percent and Idaho at 2.3 percent. Alaska has compounded job creation at 1.6 percent, Washington at 1.4 percent and Oregon at 1.2 percent. And California? California has experienced an average annual employment growth of 0.64 percent (zero-point-six-four percent). It has bettered New York, but that is nothing to write home about except as a tale of woe.\n\nMost recently, from the onset of the recession of 2008 to present, only one state in the Twelfth District has returned to prerecession employment levels: Alaska. The only other Western states to punch through prerecession employment levels have been North Dakota (in the Minneapolis Fed’s district) and … Texas. One might quickly deduce that these states all share a common characteristic: They are all big oil and gas producers. But as we shall see, while this certainly helps, it is only part of the picture as regards Texas.\n\n\n\nI am going to narrow this down a little to focus specifically on Texas and California, the megastates of the West.\n\n\n\nI think it fair to say that, as regards job creation, Texas has been “dynamic,” per this conference’s flyer. A better descriptive word starting with ‘dy’ for California would be “dysphoric,” an adjective derived from dysphoros, classical Greek for “hard to bear” and more commonly translated into English to describe “a state of feeling unwell or unhappy,” according to Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary.\n\nA snapshot of the unhappy state of affairs in California is provided by a much discussed metric: the percentages of homes that remain “underwater,” as shown by this graph comparing California with the rest of the U.S. and Texas.\n\n\n\nThere are many other economic indicators that illustrate the dire economic condition of California and the more felicitous economy of Texas. You all know what they are; I won’t dwell on them for fear of being pelted by bread rolls or worse at this pleasant luncheon.\n\nThe question is: Why? Why has the Golden State lost its luster and become a place where the economic burdens of its people have become hard to bear, when once it was the very exemplar of happy, hearty dynamism that is the West? How could it be that the hardscrabble Lone Star State has come to replace California as the engine of the West’s economic growth?\n\nThere are many reasons, to be sure. But one thing I can tell you with absolute certainty is that California’s underperformance has nothing to do with the Federal Reserve. After all, Texas works with the same monetary policy as California and the other states of the union. Texans pay the same interest rates on mortgages and on commercial and industrial and consumer loans; they work under the same federal regulatory regime governing banks and financial institutions and operate with the same stock market as the rest of the nation.\n\nNor can Texas’ relative outperformance be attributed, as it stereotypically is, to oil and gas. To be sure, Texas produces more oil than Norway and more natural gas than Canada. But here is the dirty little secret: Like California, Texas has a widely diversified economy. As the following chart of where jobs have been created thus far in 2012 demonstrates, Texas is diversified more than most people think. The oil and gas and mining sector accounts for only 2.4 percent of its employment and produces approximately 8 percent of the state’s tax revenue. Utilizing the latest technology to develop new oil and gas and gas liquid fields, the energy sector has created over 14,000 jobs in Texas thus far in 2012. But professional and business services have created 62,100; trade, transportation and utilities—47,800; educational and health services—36,000; leisure and hospitality—33,000; construction—23,000; and even the government has created more than the oil and gas sector, with 14,200 jobs. All in, the non-energy sectors of the economy have created nearly 640,000 jobs since the recovery began in Texas in November 2009.\n\n\n\nTrue, Texas lags California and most other states in social services. We are the antithesis of the welfare state. And yet, we are the indisputable leader of job creation in the nation, outpacing the United States by a factor of more than 2-to-1 over two decades. We draw massive inflows of business investment, and we attract significant numbers of immigrants from within the United States, even more so than we draw in from across the border and abroad.\n\nLook at these charts of net migration for California and Texas (I have thrown in New York for added measure):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, Texas has a low propensity of social services, and employment growth should not be the only criterion for evaluating a state’s performance. But we must remember that economic growth is the foundation for the other goals and aspirations a society may have. You cannot pay for social services unless you have the tax revenue to do so. You cannot have tax revenue unless you have sources from whom to collect it. And the best revenue source of all is a citizenry that is fully employed and an economy that is prosperous. Moreover, we must not forget that a job is critical to a sense of self-worth, dignity and pride.\n\nAs these previous charts indicate, Texas is a leader in creating jobs. If you believe people vote with their feet, the balance Texas has struck between job creation and social services seems appropriate enough to attract the diaspora of the other megastates.\n\nThe great country western singer George Strait appears to have summed it all up with his iconic tune “All My Exes Live in Texas”: ex-businesses, ex-workers and ex-taxpayers seem to be joining his many ex-wives in migrating to our part of the West.\n\nTo be sure, Texas is hardly a paradise. We have plenty of natural beauty, but nothing we have can compare to the magnificence of California’s beaches and ocean vistas, mountains, redwood forests, and rich and plentiful ecosystems. We are admittedly miserly with our social welfare programs. We fall short in many other social metrics. And yet for the West—beyond Texas and the job-creating states in the Ninth and Tenth Federal Reserve districts—to remain the source of innovation and growth and economic prosperity that it has been, California will have to achieve the kind of balance between social and environmental responsibility and the capacity to provide for a prosperous economy that is taught at the Graduate School of Business here at Stanford.\n\nRight now, that balance seems to have been lost. It is costing California jobs and people and is depleting its revenue coffers. We shall see if the new tax increase levied by popular acclaim on top of already highly taxed and heavily regulated business operators will improve or exacerbate that imbalance.\n\nI have my concerns. The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco recently released a paper titled “Assessing State Business Climate Indexes.”[4] It confirms what you needn’t have a Stanford education to conclude: “Economies of states ranked high on the tax-and-cost indexes”—meaning lower taxes and costs of doing business—“tended to grow faster than the states ranked [poorly] on these indexes.” Of course, one need only look out the window here to see that a pretty attractive quality of life abounds in slow-growing, high-tax and expensive California. But the question is: How long can a high quality of life be maintained if too few jobs are being created and people and businesses, taxpayers all, are fleeing to other states?\n\nAs much as I respect the San Francisco Fed’s research department, I think the cartoonists at The New Yorker have said it best. This gem appeared in a recent edition and sums it all up.\n\nSurely, the West would be better off with a strong, job-creating Texas and a strong, job-creating California, just as it has strong, job-creating economies in many if not all of the states of the Ninth and Tenth Federal Reserve districts and some parts of the Twelfth. I am hoping this conference will zero in on how this can be accomplished, for the West can only be as strong as our weakest link—and we can ill afford to have California remain so.\n\nThank you. Now, in the great tradition of central bankers, I would be happy to avoid answering any questions you might have.\n\n",

            "content": "November 2, 2012 Houston, Texas\n\nBuenos días a todos y bienvenidos. We are very pleased that you are joining us today for what promises to be an enriching program. I want to acknowledge Pia Orrenius, Roberto Coronado and Jesus Cañas, who have worked so hard to make this conference possible. A big thank you also goes out to Daron Peschel and his staff for hosting all of us here in Houston.\n\nFor this conference, we are joined by some of the top development experts in academia from both the United States and Mexico. Also, Ambassador Garza will be speaking at lunch; we are grateful that Tony has taken the time to join us and look forward to hearing his perspective on los cambios que están por venir en México—the coming changes in Mexico. Deputy Governor Sánchez from Banco de México is also here. He addressed conference speakers and organizers at dinner last night. Manuel: gracias por tu presencia y tus comentarios anoche.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas has a long tradition of consultation and exchange with Banco de México. Most recently, we hosted Agustín Carstens, Governor of Banco de México, last year in Dallas, and I was in Mexico City last February where I had a splendid visit at the Banco and la Bolsa Mexicana de Valores. Just two weeks ago today, the Houston Branch board of directors had a joint board meeting with their Banco de México sister branch—la sucursal de Veracruz. The Houston and Veracruz directors, and our respective economists, shared their views of the regional and national economies in Texas and Veracruz, Mexico, and the United States.\n\nWhen we take the macroeconomic temperature of our two economies, I am always struck by how far Mexico has come. I like to say that the U.S. would do well to borrow Mexico’s play book when it comes to restoring fiscal discipline and fostering macroeconomic stability and growth. Let me explain what I mean, starting with the numbers.\n\nYear over year, the U.S. economy has grown 2.3 percent. Mexico is growing almost twice as fast at 4.1 percent. U.S. employment has grown 1.3 percent year to date at an annualized rate, while formal sector jobs in Mexico have grown 4.8 percent over the same period.\n\nThe U.S. deficit is 7 percent of gross domestic product (GDP); Mexico’s deficit is about 2 percent of their GDP. The U.S. national debt—over $16 trillion—is a staggering 103 percent of U.S. GDP, while Mexico’s national debt is just 28 percent of its GDP.\n\nIn sum, our economy is growing slowly, weighed down by debt and the pervasive uncertainty caused by our nation’s fiscal imbalances and growing regulatory complexity. Mexico, in contrast, is growing robustly, and, in contrast to their Washington counterparts, Mexican policymakers are demonstrating remarkable commitment to fiscal discipline.\n\nTo appreciate the significance of Mexico’s progress, you really need the historical perspective. Between 1975 and 2000, there was one crisis after another: in 1976, 1982, 1985—88 and 1994. Most of those crises corresponded with national elections; presidential sexenios were routinely welcomed with peso devaluations of 40 percent or more. The peso became the symptom of a diseased and dysfunctional macroeconomy. In 1982, Mexico defaulted on its external debt, resulting in capital flight, continuing devaluations and soaring inflation.\n\nAnnual inflation averaged 15 percent in the 1970s and 70 percent in the 1980s, before descending to a still punishing level of 20 percent in the 1990s. Living standards stagnated as growth in real output per capita slowed to just 0.7 percent per annum between 1981 and 2000. These were, as others have noted, Mexico’s lost decades.\n\nIt seemed each crisis resulted in a package of promised reforms, and that all ended in failure. But that’s not quite right. Several important reforms actually paved the way for future success.\n\nIn 1986, for example, Mexico joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT—now the World Trade Organization, or WTO). Then came the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Tariffs fell steeply, and trade would come to prosper.\n\nOther reforms followed, as did deregulation and privatization, but as a central banker, I like to focus on the role of monetary policy reforms in restoring Mexico’s access to global capital markets. In 1993, Banco de México became a truly independent central bank, which spelled the end of the monetization of government debt and the end of hyperinflation. In 2001, the central bank adopted inflation targeting, another significant reform with lasting implications for the nation.\n\nAs a result of these reforms, the peso is now a store of value. The central bank’s commitment to low inflation has led to a peso-denominated bond market and falling interest rates. Previous to 1995, the Mexican yield curve ran all the way out to … 28 days! Cetes were the only form of issuance.\n\nIn 1995, the Mexican government began to progressively build a yield curve. That year it issued peso-denominated notes up to one year in maturity; in 2000, notes up to five years; in 2004, bonds up to 20 years; and in 2006, 30-year peso-denominated bonds.\n\nClearly when it comes to monetary policy, Mexico’s reforms have begun to pay off. The progress that Mexico has made is truly remarkable and, I believe, a source of inspiration for both the U.S. and Europe as they contemplate the challenges ahead.\n\nLet me close my welcome by saying that what makes this day even more special is that so many of us are here not only to satisfy our intellectual curiosity and further our professional development, but because of our affection for Mexico. Estamos aqui porque nos interesa México. You may know that I spent my early childhood in Mexico City. We can’t go back to that idyllic period of the 1950s. But it makes me wonder how modern democratic Mexico might recapture and improve upon the optimism, dynamism, peace, prosperity and safety that seemed to prevail back then. Creo que es posible—I think it can; now you just have to tell me how. Les deseo buena suerte. Have a productive conference!\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "October 10, 2012 Washington, D.C.\n\nThank you, Michael [Tanner].\n\nYou and your colleagues have had a long day. So far today, you’ve had 21 speakers and panelists addressing Europe’s crisis and lessons for the United States. Being the Cato Institute, devoted as you are to advocating for “free, open and civil societies” based on “the principles of limited government, free markets, individual liberty and peace,” the conference has done a pretty thorough job of highlighting how the financial burden of the American welfare apparatus—Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and other entitlements that encumber our nation’s balance sheet—must be resolved if we are to avoid arriving at the same destination as Europe.\n\nIt would take a strong person to spend an entire day listening to the tales of cautionary woe about Europe’s pathology so near to our dysfunctional Capitol and resist the urge to rush home and slit his wrists. I am going to try to end today’s discussion on a more pleasant plane, acknowledging our problems here, yet pointing to some factors that give me hope. I will spend little time talking about monetary policy. After I am done with these comments, I’ll be happy to avoid answering any questions you might have on that front.\n\nIt is a sad day when the Financial Times opens its Monday edition with the first sentence of its lead article declaring, “The U.S. is the brightest spot in the world economy,” then qualifies the comment by pointing out that we shine only within a global economy that is “on the ropes.”[1] This was followed yesterday by a Wall Street Journal report from Tokyo under a banner headline—“Global Recession Risk Rises.” The article says, “The IMF upgraded growth prospects for only one major nation compared with its July forecast. It projected that the U.S. would grow 2.2 percent this year, 0.1 percentage point”—zero point one—“higher than previously estimated.”[2] One is tempted to conclude, as I have remarked on many occasions, that we are but the “best-looking horse in the glue factory” of hapless economies.\n\nI have a preferred equine analogy for the American economy. It looks like this:\n\n© Bob Coglianese\n\n\n\nIt is of the Triple Crown winner, Secretariat, a chestnut thoroughbred with a strong, muscular physique, leading the pack by a record-breaking 31 lengths at the Belmont Stakes for a victory that would shock the world. I am convinced that with proper care and feeding, American businesses can pace us to win the equivalent of the Triple Crown of the global economy. And I believe we have laboratories within our own borders, such as Texas, that provide us with examples of how Congress might help businesses do so and help our nation avoid the European trap.\n\nIf we can liberate the private sector from the shackles of uncertainty about fiscal policy and overregulation and take the best from states that have succeeded in attracting job-creating businesses, I am convinced that, like Secretariat at Belmont, the United States can win the longest of races by an astonishing margin. And in doing so, we can show the way for others.\n\nHow might this be done? What is holding us back?\n\nIt helps to retrace a little recent history.\n\nOn this 50th anniversary of the Cuban missile crisis, it is important to remember that we won. We won the Cold War. We spent a generation of blood and treasure to move from the constant threat of mutually assured destruction to mutually assured competition. As we did in the aftermath of many of our nation’s great struggles—World War I and World War II—we emerged from a titanic struggle with the Soviet Union as the victor and world leader. We not only liberated Eastern Europe when the Berlin Wall came down, but also incentivized the forces of economic reform in China, Vietnam, India and elsewhere. We got exactly what we fought for: A world economy expanded by billions of new consumers and producers of goods and services rather than weapons of war.\n\nWhat followed the fall of the Soviet threat was an opening up of the world economy, aided by trade liberalization championed by two presidents—a Republican named George H.W. Bush, and a Democrat, Bill Clinton—who together shaped and delivered the Uruguay Round, the North American Free Trade Agreement, the World Trade Organization and myriad other arrangements to allow for the freer flow of goods, communications and capital. This is worth remembering: Under both Republican and Democratic leadership, we did what was economically sensible.\n\nThe result was a long-lived expansion. But it ended in tears. Success led to complacency; complacency led to a tolerance and even encouragement of excess. We spent more than we could afford; our government—Republicans and Democrats alike—continued, at an accelerated pace, down the path of promising more in social programs and other spending programs than we could sustain. And on the regulatory front, we turned a collective blind eye to economic malpractice, resulting in the spectacular failure of Enron and culminating with the collapse of megabanks for which even a cursory glance at their balance sheets would have revealed, in the words of one of my colleagues, “nothing on the right was right and nothing on the left was left.” What started out as a widely heralded period of Great Moderation and seemingly endless growth metastasized into a cancer of excess and speculation, resulting in a crash from which we are now only slowly—very, very slowly—recovering.\n\nThe wreckage and its aftermath have been widely discussed and analyzed in countless fora and publications. This afternoon, I want to quickly highlight some key outcomes that are often overlooked.\n\nFirst among them is that American businesses have emerged from the crisis revamped and hyper-efficient. When producers of goods and services cannot price what goes out the door as richly as the cost of what comes in the door, as was beginning to occur in the summer of 2008, or when demand for one’s product collapses, as happened post-Lehman, and firms can’t grow their top line—they batten down the hatches, looking to preserve their margins by cutting costs and ramping up productivity. Over the past four-plus years, U.S. businesses have cut operating costs to the bone. They have taken advantage of the cheap and abundant money made possible by the Federal Reserve to rejigger their balance sheets, exploiting the lower cost of debt and the Fed-driven bull market for stocks. American businesses—large and small, public and private—have done this with an alacrity that has dismantled the momentary notion that the European business model was superior, or that the Chinese adaptation of economic management was somehow better suited for a globalized economy. The private sector in the United States has adjusted to the new world faster than you can say, “Japan is No. 1.” American business is now more fit to compete than ever before.\n\nSecond, despite a lot of fire breathing and beating of the breast, our government has for the most part preserved the open-trade environment fashioned under our 41st and 42nd presidents. Protectionism has been held at bay. Our businesses have the entire world to source from and sell to. They also have the option to invest in job-creating ventures in more places than ever before, an option necessitating that our government reboot tax policy if it wishes for American businesses to invest in job creation at home.\n\nThird, we have more than enough fuel in reserve to finance a prolonged period of job creation and economic expansion. The Fed has $1.4 trillion in excess private bank reserves on deposit at the 12 Federal Reserve Banks; there are additional cash resources lying fallow in nondepository financial enterprises; there is an additional $2 trillion or so of cash or cash-equivalent assets sitting on the sidelines in the coffers of businesses, above and beyond their operating needs and present plans for capital expenditure (capex). The cost of money is nil. Interest rates for creditworthy businesses are the lowest in the history of the republic. Hawks like me worry that our central bank has done far more than what was required and are concerned about the difficulties we will encounter when we need to tighten policy and exit from über-easy monetary policy. But this much I know: Presently, American businesses—big and small, public and private—have money burning a hole in their pockets. They have the financial wherewithal to expand and hire.\n\nSo here we are: American businesses are muscular and fit, rich and ready to roll. Now, what do we need to induce them to hire and put the American people back to work in order to restore economic growth and prosperity?\n\nObviously, we need to have demand to sell into. One does not need to read the Financial Times or the Wall Street Journal to know that the global economy has slowed and that exports will not drive U.S. final demand for the foreseeable future. At home, our government is drowning in debt and is hyper-leveraged. The cost of its debt burden is being mitigated by accommodative monetary policy, but our federal government has reached its limit as a direct source of aggregate demand or investment impetus. Even if we wanted to, we cannot look to government to propel the economy forward. This leaves domestic consumption and investment by the private sector as the best hope for us to remain “the brightest spot in the world economy.”\n\nBut, as any student of elementary economics knows, you can’t grow consumption unless you grow income. You can’t grow income unless you put the American people back to work. And you can’t put the people back to work unless businesses invest and expand their payrolls. But here is the rub: You can’t expect businesses to expand payrolls or job-creating capex unless they decide to use the abundant cash and cheap credit they have ready access to; they will not invest if they are totally uncertain about the return they might earn on that investment.\n\nThe first thing an aspiring MBA candidate or any entrepreneur learns is that business is the art of decisionmaking under conditions of uncertainty. Businesses can manage around a reasonable amount of uncertainty. But under conditions of total uncertainty, they cannot make the kinds of strategic decisions that result in significant expansion.\n\nAmerican businesses face the uncertainty of the European miasma much discussed here today. And they are increasingly uncertain about the once “sure thing” of China as a source of seemingly endless future demand. The slowing globalized economy—a “world economy on the ropes”—is without a doubt a great source of uncertainty and a retardant to job creation and expansion. But I would argue that nimble business operators can manage that risk. What they cannot manage is the mordant fiscal predicament hanging over their heads. A feckless American government—specifically, a Congress that hasn’t created a budget for more than three years—is poised to drive us off the so-called fiscal cliff. It has contrived a tax code and regulatory structure that would baffle a financial Houdini, has compounded the uncertainty facing businesses to a stifling degree. At present, no business—big or small, public or private—knows what its tax rates will be going forward. No business knows the social overhead needed to cover their employees. No business knows the degree to which federal spending programs will be changed or truncated, and how that will impact it or its customer base.\n\nWithout some certainty about your cost factors or reasonable understanding of the prospects for demand for your products, you go into a defensive crouch. You can’t budget; you can’t plan. You can’t run the risk of hiring and expanding beyond your replacement needs. Uncertainty of the kind I have just described cripples job creation, capital investment and the ability of businesses to realize their potential.\n\nHere is a direct quote from the October survey of 691 small and medium-sized businesses by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), released just yesterday:\n\n“Uncertainty appears to dominate the outlook. … Spending and hiring are on hold … owners are in maintenance mode. ... Record numbers of consumers feel that the government is doing a poor job [per the University of Michigan survey] and record numbers of small-business owners report the political climate as a reason not to expand.” The text of the release goes on to say, “Only 8 percent [of those surveyed] complained that they didn’t get all the credit they wanted. Two percent say credit is their top business problem compared to 21 percent each citing taxes, regulations and red tape, and poor sales.”[3]\n\nWith regard to job-creating capital expenditures, two recent studies are worth contemplating. The first is a survey of CFOs conducted last month—before the last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee—by Duke University’s Fuqua School. Of the 887 CFOs surveyed, only 14.5 percent listed “credit markets/interest rates” as among the top three concerns facing their corporations, with 84 percent saying they would not change their investment plans if interest rates dropped by 2 percent. In contrast, 43 percent listed consumer demand among their top three concerns, while 41 percent cited federal government policies.[4]\n\nThe second was a study conducted earlier in the year by Professors Michael Porter and Jan Rivkin, surveying nearly 10,000 Harvard Business School alumni, with a special focus on 1,700 respondents who were “personally involved in decisions about whether to place business activities and jobs in the U.S. or elsewhere.” Here is a pie chart from the study, summarizing the most commonly mentioned impediments to investing and creating jobs in the U.S.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote the slices with asterisks, signifying that uncertainty is a theme within the categories of taxes, macroeconomics, regulations and health care. And note this direct quote from the report: “We asked an open-ended question: What are the greatest impediments to investing and creating jobs in the United States? … In the realm of taxes … respondents were deterred from investing in the United States not simply by a high statutory corporate tax rate, but also by the sheer complexity and uncertain future of the tax code. Similarly, with respect to regulations, respondents identified uncertainty as a barrier nearly as often as they pointed to regulatory burden and they highlighted the bureaucratic complexity commonly associated with compliance and permitting.”[5]\n\nI did not see any direct reference in the text of Porter and Rivkin’s study to monetary policy as an inhibitor of investment plans.\n\nIf 42 percent of the NFIB’s businesses and 41 percent of those surveyed by Duke University cite federal government policies and red tape as their biggest inhibitor to job-creating expansion; if Porter and Rivkin’s work makes clear that uncertainty and complexity about taxes and regulation are deterrents to investing in the U.S.; if small and medium and large businesses feel they have sufficient financial access or wherewithal to conduct their affairs, then I don’t think it takes a genius to conclude what needs fixing if we are to treat the problem of unemployment and anemic economic growth in this country.\n\nThe fix lies not within the purview of the Federal Reserve. The fix lies solely in the hands of a government that has the power to shape taxes and spending programs to incent businesses to go out and hire rather than ball up into a defensive crouch, or worse, go elsewhere in the world that we worked so hard to liberate, to create jobs for others rather than for our own people.\n\nThe private sector and American business community are poised to expand. But they will not do so as long as we have a government that cannot resist the temptation to devise a politically convenient patchwork instead of laying out a convincing, reliable, long-term program that job creators and consumers can count on and plan around.\n\nThis is a point that I believe is widely neglected. Short-term fixes to our fiscal and regulatory pathology will not solve the problem of unemployment and economic sluggishness. The great inhibitor of job creation is the uncertainty over taxes and spending and regulation that plagues businesses. Even if businesses do not like the rules that govern their behavior, knowing those rules with certainty gives them something to plan around and navigate through. Presently, they haven’t the foggiest idea what the rules will be.\n\nThere are many macroeconomists and politicians who look at the fiscal cliff and, worried that inaction will plunge us into recession by both raising taxes and dramatically cutting spending, suggest that one-year or other short-term fixes will stave off recession. That is true from a macroeconomic standpoint; I have no quarrel with this logic. But it will come at a cost: Short-term fixes only push out the envelope of uncertainty. If the fix is for nine months or one year, then businesses will wait for nine months or a year before making major commitments to hire or invest. We might heave a collective sigh of relief that we did not drive off the cliff, but to job creators, this is just another reason to stall until a long-term, dependable resolution is crafted. A far better outcome will be for fiscal authorities to provide a convincing, long-term solution to our fiscal woes. Until then, our economy will perform well below capacity. We may outpace our hapless friends in Europe or elsewhere—we may remain the best-looking horse in the glue factory—but we will not realize our thoroughbred potential.\n\nLuckily, we have some examples of success in the American economic laboratory. I live within one: Texas. Here is a graph charting 22 years of job creation in Texas versus the other large states and the United States as a whole.\n\n\n\nThink about it: Texas works with the same monetary policy as the other 49 states do. We pay the same interest rates on mortgages and on commercial and industrial and consumer loans; we work under the same federal regulatory regime governing banks and financial institutions and operate with the same stock market as the rest of the nation. To be sure, we have some natural advantages: We produce more oil than Norway and more natural gas than Canada. But here is the dirty little secret: Like the United States, we are a diversified economy. As this chart of where jobs were created in 2011 demonstrates, Texas is diversified pretty much along the lines of the United States. The oil and gas and mining sector accounts for only 2.3 percent of our employment. The sector created over 37,000 jobs in 2011, but the trade, transportation and utilities; professional and business services; and educational and health services sectors created more.\n\n\n\nWorking under the same federal fiscal and monetary policy as the rest of the United States, Texas has created over 50 percent more jobs than it had in 1990, whereas New York has expanded its nonfarm employment by a paltry 6 percent, Illinois by 8 percent and California by 14 percent.\n\nTrue, we lag the other states shown on this chart in social services. We are the antithesis of the welfare state. And yet we are the indisputable leader of job creation in the nation, outpacing the United States by 2.5 to 1 over two decades. We draw massive inflows of business investment, and we attract significant numbers of immigrants from within the United States and from abroad.\n\nLook at this chart of immigrant flows for Texas.\n\n\n\nAnd now compare it with these charts of flows for California, New York and Illinois.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, we have a low propensity of social services. But we excel at creating the single most important driver of human dignity and pride: jobs. If you believe people vote with their feet, the balance we have struck between job creation and social services seems appropriate enough to attract the diaspora of the other megastates. We must be doing something right in Texas.\n\nThe 22-year time span of the spaghetti graph I showed earlier covers legislatures that, under both Democratic and Republican leadership and Democratic and Republican governors, have created a pro-business, pro-growth environment. I would suggest that if you want to see an economy that has avoided the traps of an overburdened social structure like that which you have discussed today, and if you want to consider a fiscal and regulatory regime that attracts rather than chases away business and jobs, you might look to Texas.\n\nYou might then compare it to California, which has the opposite approach and is paying a price for it.\n\nA friend of mine from Los Angeles recently encapsulated the difference between California and Texas in a short story that you Cato-ites might find amusing:\n\n“The governor of California is jogging with his dog along a nature trail. A coyote jumps out and attacks the governor’s dog, then bites the governor. The governor starts to intervene, but reflects upon the movie Bambi and then realizes he should stop because the coyote is only doing what is natural.\n\n“He calls animal control. Animal control captures the coyote and bills the state $200 for testing it for diseases and $500 for relocating it. He calls a veterinarian. The vet collects the dead dog and bills the state $200 for testing it for diseases. The governor goes to the hospital and spends $3,500 getting checked for diseases from the coyote and getting his bite wound bandaged.\n\n“The running trail gets shut down for six months while the California Fish and Game Department conducts a $100,000 survey to make sure the area is now free of dangerous animals. The governor spends $50,000 in state funds implementing a ‘coyote awareness program’ for residents of the area. The Legislature spends $2 million to study how to better treat rabies and how to permanently eradicate the disease throughout the world.\n\n“The governor’s security agent is fired for not stopping the attack. The state spends $150,000 to hire and train a new agent with additional special training, re: the nature of coyotes. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) protests the coyote’s relocation and files a $5 million suit against the state.\n\n“The governor of Texas is jogging with his dog along a nature trail. A coyote jumps out and tries to attack him and his dog. The governor shoots the coyote with his state-issued pistol and keeps jogging.\n\n“The governor spent 50 cents on a .380-caliber, hollow-point cartridge. Buzzards ate the dead coyote.\n\n“And that, my friends, is why California is broke and Texas is not.”\n\nWe don’t have to follow the path of California. Or that of Europe. Texas has no monopoly on good government. It is but an example, however imperfect, of what I believe Cato holds dear in its vision for an operating economy. And if the United States Congress would look to it and other states that have found the secret to unleashing the best of the animal spirits of the marketplace, there is no question in my mind that America can outshine the rest of the world and lead it back to economic growth and expanding prosperity. To unlock that brighter future, Congress must set aside its partisan bickering and short-term political myopia and get down to crafting a tax, spending and regulatory regime that not only reins in deficit spending and runaway unfunded liabilities, but also focuses on incentivizing America’s businesses to create jobs. If they do, we will end up like Secretariat at Belmont, winning the race for prosperity by 31 lengths or more.\n\nThank you.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "September 19, 2012 New York, N.Y.\n\nThank you, Nicole [Parent]. And thanks to the Harvard Club of New York for including me in your speaker series. It is quite something to see one’s picture on the cover of the Harvard Club of New York Bulletin wedged between that of Tommy Tune and Nina Khrushcheva, Nikita Khrushchev’s great-granddaughter.\n\nMy wife Nancy and I celebrated our 39th anniversary on Sept. 8. Knowing that she has seen and loved everything our fellow Texan Tommy Tune has ever done on the musical stage, and having grown up with the image of Nikita Khrushchev as First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union banging his shoe on the podium of the United Nations and saying, “We will bury you!” I thought I would impress her that evening by showing her the Bulletin. “In your wildest dreams,” I asked her, “did you ever think that the skinny, long-haired boy you married 39 years ago would be headlining a speaker series alongside Tommy Tune and Nikita Khrushchev’s great-granddaughter?” Her answer was classic: “Richard, we have been married for four decades. I hate to disappoint you sweetheart, but you don’t appear in my wildest dreams.”\n\nI am here to speak to you about monetary policy. But before I start, I am going to take advantage of your undivided attention to announce to all assembled here tonight that the former president of this club and my fellow Harvard Overseer, Nicole Parent, is engaged to be married. Nicole, may your marriage last at least 39 years and may you be blessed with the wildest of dreams and the best of life.\n\nIn addition to the Algonquin, there are two iconic buildings on this side of West 44th Street. One is the New York Yacht Club; the other is the Harvard Club. I mention this because the close proximity of these two buildings suggests something of a biographical metaphor. I spent four years at a Naval Academy prep school before becoming a midshipman in 1967 at Annapolis, where I majored in engineering and learned the craft of seamanship and naval warfare. Then, in 1969, Harvard kindly recruited me in as a transfer student. Two years later, I graduated with a degree in economics.\n\nIn thinking through many of the policy issues that confront me as a member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), I tend to combine both backgrounds, as well as an orientation framed by having an MBA and spending a significant portion of my career as a banker and market operator. My perspective is thus framed from the viewpoint of an engineer, an MBA and a former market operator—not as a PhD economist. For most economic theoreticians, hundreds of billions, or even trillions, of dollars are inputs into a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model and other econometric equations. To a banker, businessperson or market operator, these are real dollars that have to be thought of within the framework of a transmission mechanism that needs to get the money from its origin at the Fed into the real economy with maximum efficacy. My focus tends toward the practicable—how to harness theory to devise a workable solution to the problems that confront a central banker. There are many superb PhD theorists among the 19 members of the FOMC and support staff. There are only a handful of us—four, to be exact—who have worked as bankers or in the financial markets.\n\nTonight, I am going to provide my take on the FOMC’s most recent decision to embark on a new round of quantitative easing focused on mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Given my background, and the fact that the Navy is once again welcome back in Harvard Yard, I’ll ask your forbearance if I use some seafaring references.[1]\n\nAs the book kindly cited by Nicole says, I am given to providing the “straight skinny.”[2] I am a Texan. I speak bluntly and directly. I am not given to circumlocution, and I checked diplomacy at the door when I gave up my post as an ambassador and trade negotiator. Please don’t take offense and please bear in mind that my comments this evening are mine alone; I do not claim to speak for anybody else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI shall start my remarks with what I argued at last week’s FOMC meeting, then finish with some comments on the outcome of that meeting and what needs to be done next.\n\nIt will come as no surprise to those who know me that I did not argue in favor of additional monetary accommodation during our meetings last week. I have repeatedly made it clear, in internal FOMC deliberations and in public speeches, that I believe that with each program we undertake to venture further in that direction, we are sailing deeper into uncharted waters. We are blessed at the Fed with sophisticated econometric models and superb analysts. We can easily conjure up plausible theories as to what we will do when it comes to our next tack or eventually reversing course. The truth, however, is that nobody on the committee, nor on our staffs at the Board of Governors and the 12 Banks, really knows what is holding back the economy. Nobody really knows what will work to get the economy back on course. And nobody—in fact, no central bank anywhere on the planet—has the experience of successfully navigating a return home from the place in which we now find ourselves. No central bank—not, at least, the Federal Reserve—has ever been on this cruise before.\n\nThis much we do know: Our engine room is already flush with $1.6 trillion in excess private bank reserves owned by the banking sector and held by the 12 Federal Reserve Banks. Trillions more are sitting on the sidelines in corporate coffers. On top of all that, a significant amount of underemployed cash—or fuel for investment—is burning a hole in the pockets of money market funds and other nondepository financial operators. This begs the question: Why would the Fed provision to shovel billions in additional liquidity into the economy’s boiler when so much is presently lying fallow?\n\nGreat battles at sea are fought with modern analytical tools and the most sophisticated IT and advanced weaponry available. Fleet commanders, like central bankers, use every bit of the intelligence, technology and theory at their command. But ultimately, just as with great engagements at sea, the decisive factor is judgment. In forming their judgments, fleet commanders rely upon briefings from their senior officer corps on the elements, on the conditions at hand and on their tactical and strategic recommendations before deciding on the proper course of action.\n\nAs you all know, the Federal Reserve’s mission is mandated by the Congress. It calls for us to steer a monetary course according to a dual mandate—we are charged with maintaining price stability while conducting policy so as to best assist in achieving full employment. Most all of the FOMC members—the senior officer corps of the Federal Reserve fleet—have surveyed the horizon from their different watch stations and agree that inflation is not an immediately foreseeable threat. Over the past week, however, there has been a noticeable increase in the longer-term inflation expectations inferred from bond yields. These inferences can be volatile and are not always reliable, but a sustained increase would suggest incipient doubts about our commitment to the Bernanke Doctrine of sailing on a course consistent with 2 percent long-term inflation. I believe that even the slightest deviation from this course could induce some debilitating mal de mer in the markets.\n\nIn the current tumultuous economic sea, facing strong headwinds common in the aftermath of financial crises and balance-sheet recessions, our desired port is increased employment. Certain theories and various hypothetical studies and models tell us that flooding the markets with copious amounts of cheap, plentiful liquidity will lift final demand, both through the “wealth effect” channel and by directly stimulating businesses to expand and hire. And yet from the perspective of my watch station—as I have reported time and again—the very people we wish to stoke consumption and final demand by creating jobs and expanding business fixed investment are not responding to our policy initiatives as well as theory might suggest.\n\nSurveys of small and medium-size businesses, the wellsprings of job creation, are telling us that nine out of 10 of those businesses are either not interested in borrowing or have no problem accessing cheap financing if they want it. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), for example, makes clear that monetary policy is not on its members’ radar screen of concerns, except that it raises fear among some of future inflationary consequences; the principal concern of the randomly sampled small businesses surveyed by the NFIB is with regulatory and fiscal uncertainty.[3] This is not terribly difficult to understand: If you are a small business, especially, and not only if you operate as an S corporation or as a limited liability company, you are stymied by not knowing what your tax rate will be in future years, or how you should cost out the social overhead of your employees or how you should budget for the proliferation of regulations flowing from Washington.\n\nWith regard to business fixed investment and job-creating capital expenditures (capex), the math is pretty straightforward: Big businesses dominate that theater. Most all of these businesses have abundant cash reserves or access to money, many at negative real interest rates. I have repeatedly reported to the committee that the CEOs I personally survey will simply not be motivated by further interest rate cuts to invest domestically—beyond their maintenance needs—in job-creating capex. In preparing for this last FOMC meeting, I specifically asked my corporate interlocutors the following question: “If your costs of borrowing were to decrease by 25 or more basis points, would this induce you to spend more on job-creating expansion?” The answer from nine out of 10 was “No.”\n\nThe responses of those I surveyed are best summarized by the comments of one of the most highly respected CEOs in the country: “We are in ‘stall mode,’ stuck like Velcro, until the fog of uncertainty surrounding fiscal policy and the debacle in Europe lifts. In the meantime, anything further monetary accommodation induces in the form of cheaper capital will go to buying back our stock.” This is not an insignificant sounding, coming as it did from the CEO of a company that has the capacity to spend upward of $15 billion on capex.\n\nTo be sure, buying in stock will have a positive wealth effect on that company’s shareholders, but putting the equivalent amount of money to work in spending on plant and equipment would put more people back to work more quickly.\n\nAnother CEO of a large corporation provided me with an additional source of uncertainty. In this CEO’s words, China “may be transitioning toward becoming the caboose of the global economy rather than its engine.” This may be a tad bit hyperbolic, but it indicates there is growing uncertainty about the great emerging economy that was once considered an eternal fountain of future demand.\n\nWith the disaster that our nation’s fiscal policy has become and with uncertainty prevailing over the economic condition of both Europe and China and the prospects for final demand growth here at home, it is no small wonder that businesses are at sixes and sevens in committing to expansion of the kind we need to propel job creation.\n\nMy assessment of the efficacy of further monetary accommodation in encouraging job-creating investment among operating businesses was recently confirmed by a more rigorous analysis in the Global Business Outlook Survey of chief financial officers by the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University—the Harvard of the South—in September.[4]\n\nOf the 887 CFOs surveyed, only 129, or 14.5 percent, listed “credit markets/interest rates” among the top three concerns facing their corporations. In contrast, 43 percent listed consumer demand and 41 percent cited federal government policies. Ranking third on their list was price pressures from competitors (thus affirming most hawks’ sense that inflationary pressure is presently sedentary); fourth was global financial instability. The analysts at Duke summarized their findings as follows: “CFOs believe that a monetary action would not be particularly effective. Ninety-one percent of firms say that they would not change their investment plans even if interest rates dropped by 1 percent, and 84 percent say that they would not change investment plans if interest rates dropped by 2 percent.”\n\nCiting these observations, I suggested last week that the committee might consider the efficacy of further monetary accommodation. When I raised this point inside the Fed and in public speeches, some suggested that perhaps my corporate contacts were “not sophisticated” in the workings of monetary policy and could not see the whole picture from their vantage point. True. But final demand does not spring from thin air. “Sophisticated” or not, these business operators are the target of our policy initiatives: You cannot have consumption and growth in final demand without income growth; you cannot grow income without job creation; you cannot create jobs unless those who have the capacity to hire people—private sector employers—go out and hire.\n\nIn the period between the August FOMC meeting and the meeting last week, some very prominent academic and policy sophisticates also questioned the efficacy of large-scale asset purchases. Among them were Michael Woodford of Columbia University—a former colleague of Ben Bernanke’s when they were at Princeton—and Bill White of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and formerly of the Bank for International Settlements, and others.\n\nLike me, Professor Woodford argues that the economy would not benefit from additional liquidity. Like me, he argues that large-scale asset purchases and maturity-extension programs like Operation Twist are unlikely to appreciably stimulate private borrowing activity through portfolio-balance or term-premium effects.[5] And as for Bill White—a globally respected economist who stood up to convention and predicted in 2003 that policies being pursued at the time would engender the financial crisis of 2008–09—here is what he wrote in a particularly thought-provoking paper a week before the Fed’s annual symposium last month at Jackson Hole, Wyo.:[6]\n\n“In this paper, an attempt is made to evaluate the desirability of ultra easy monetary policy by weighing up the balance of the desirable short run effects and the undesirable longer run effects—the unintended consequences … It is suggested that there are grounds to believe that monetary stimulus operating through traditional (‘flow’) channels might now be less effective in stimulating aggregate demand than is commonly asserted … It is further contended that cumulative (‘stock’) effects provide negative feedback mechanisms that also weaken growth over time … In the face of such ‘stock’ effects, stimulative policies that have worked in the past eventually lose their effectiveness.\n\n“It is also argued … that, over time, easy monetary policies threaten the health of financial institutions and the functioning of financial markets, which are increasingly intertwined. This provides another negative feedback loop to threaten growth. Further, such policies threaten the ‘independence’ of central banks, and can encourage imprudent behavior on the part of governments. In effect, easy monetary policies can lead to moral hazard on a grand scale. Further, once on such a path, ‘exit’ becomes extremely difficult. Finally, easy monetary policy also has distributional effects, favoring debtors over creditors and the senior management of banks in particular. None of these ‘unintended consequences’ could be remotely described as desirable.”\n\nI do not necessarily agree with all of either Woodford’s or White’s arguments, but in light of my soundings of unsophisticates and sophisticates alike, I felt an urge at the meeting last week to tie the chairman to the mast, Odyssean-style, and to stuff wax in the ears of my fellow committee members, in order to resist the Siren call of further large-scale asset purchases.\n\nBut I have no such powers. I am only one officer in the loyal crew that sails under the command of Admiral Bernanke. My reports were given a fair hearing. But neither they, nor the arguments of others who questioned the need to provide further accommodation, carried the day, and a decision was made.\n\nHaving weighed the various tactical and strategic arguments of his officer corps, our helmsman decided to call down to the engine room and request that more coal be shoveled into the economy’s boilers. It was decided that further accommodation would be required in the form of mortgage-backed securities purchases of $40 billion per month and that Operation Twist and the reinvestment of principal payments from our current holdings of agency debt and MBS would be maintained: A total of $85 billion a month in additional accommodation would be added to the system at least through the end of the year. For added measure, the committee announced that if the outlook for employment does not improve “substantially,” it “will continue its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities, undertake additional asset purchases, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until such improvement is achieved.” As it always does, the FOMC noted that it will “take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.”[7]\n\nEven though I am skeptical about the efficacy of large-scale asset purchases, I understand the logic of concentrating on MBS. The program could help offset some of the drag from higher government-sponsored entities’ fees that have been recently levied, will likely lower the spreads between MBS and Treasuries and should put further juice behind the housing market—one of three durable-goods sectors that is assisting the recovery and yet is operating well below long-run potential (the other two sectors are aircraft and automobiles). The general effects of inducing more refinancing may aid housing and households in other ways. Lower mortgage rates could help improve the discretionary spending power of some homeowners. Underwater homeowners might have added incentive to continue meeting mortgage payments, spurring demand and preventing underwater mortgages from sinking the emerging housing recovery. Of course, much depends on the transmission mechanism for mortgages, as my colleague Bill Dudley spoke about yesterday.\n\nDespite my doubts about its efficacy, I pray this latest initiative will work. Since the announcement, interest rates on 30-year mortgage commitments have fallen about one-quarter percentage point—about what I had expected—so, so far, so good.\n\nI would point out to those who reacted with some invective to the committee’s decision, especially those from political corners, that it was the Congress that gave the Fed its dual mandate. That very same Congress is doing nothing to motivate business to expand and put people back to work. Our operating charter calls for us to conduct policy aimed at achieving full employment in addition to preserving price stability. A future Congress might restrict us to a single mandate—like other central banks in the world operate under—focused solely on price stability. But unless or until that is done, we have to deliver on what the American people, as conveyed by their elected representatives, expect of us.\n\nOne of the most important lessons learned during the economic recovery is that there is a limit to what monetary policy alone can achieve. The responsibility for stimulating economic growth must be shared with fiscal policy. Ironically, and sadly, Congress is doing nothing to incent job creators to use the copious liquidity the Federal Reserve has provided. Indeed, it is doing everything to discourage job creation. Small wonder that the respondents to my own inquires and the NFIB and Duke University surveys are in “stall” or “Velcro” mode.\n\nThe FOMC is doing everything it can to encourage the U.S. economy to steam forward. When we meet, we consider views that range from the most cautious perspectives on policy, such as my own, to the more accommodative recommendations of the well-known “doves” on the committee. We debate our different perspectives in the best tradition of civil discourse. Then, having vetted all points of view, we make a decision and act. If only the fiscal authorities could do the same! Instead, they fight, bicker and do nothing but sail about aimlessly, debauching the nation’s income statement and balance sheet with spending programs they never figure out how to finance.\n\nI am tempted to draw upon the hackneyed comparison that likens our dissolute Congress to drunken sailors. But patriots among you might take umbrage, noting that a comparison with Congress in this case might be deemed an insult to drunken sailors.\n\nIf you want to save our nation from financial disaster, may I suggest that rather than blame the Fed for being hyperactive, you devote your energy to getting our nation’s fiscal authorities to do their job.\n\nSince 1879, every chapel service at the Naval Academy concludes with a hymn that contains the following plea: “O hear us when we cry for Thee, for those in peril on the sea.” We cry for a nation that is in peril on the blustery seas of the economy. Our people are drowning in unemployment; our government is drowning in debt. You—the citizens and voters sitting in this room and elsewhere—are ultimately in command of the fleet that sails under the flag of the United States Congress. Demand that it performs its duty.\n\nJust recently, in a hearing before the Senate, your senator and my Harvard classmate, Chuck Schumer, told Chairman Bernanke, “You are the only game in town.” I thought the chairman showed admirable restraint in his response. I would have immediately answered, “No, senator, you and your colleagues are the only game in town. For you and your colleagues, Democrat and Republican alike, have encumbered our nation with debt, sold our children down the river and sorely failed our nation. Sober up. Get your act together. Illegitimum non carborundum; get on with it. Sacrifice your political ambition for the good of our country—for the good of our children and grandchildren. For unless you do so, all the monetary policy accommodation the Federal Reserve can muster will be for naught.”\n\nBut, then again, I am not Ben Bernanke. And I imagine that after listening to me this evening, you might be grateful I am not.\n\nNow, in the great tradition of central banking, I will do my utmost to provide you with the “straight skinny” and avoid answering any questions you might have.\n\nThank you.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n",

            "content": "July 9, 2012 Dallas, Texas\n\nHere is a portrait of the Australian I hold in highest regard:\n\n\n\nYou may not recognize him, so let me tell you about him.\n\nHe was born in Toowoomba, Queensland, on Oct. 18, 1904. On the 18th of January, 1910, he and his father were arrested for vagrancy in the town of Maryborough. They were taken before the Police Court that day; here is what the court record states:\n\n“Lengthy evidence was taken from which it appears that the child’s mother had deserted her husband and her [child] and is living in concubinage … The [child] has been in the care of the father for several weeks; and at 4 a.m. on the 18th, the father and child were found sleeping together under a sort of grated bridge or platform … It was shown that on previous occasions, the father and child have slept in the open in the streets adjoining the Railway Reserve, and under the shelter of verandahs and entrees of shops that were not also used as dwellings.”\n\nAccording to the arresting officer, acting Sgt. George Forest, “I have seen the [father] frequently about town for the last six months … I have never known him to do any work … I have seen him … in hotels, sometimes following drunken men. I could see he was begging … For the past two months he has almost constantly had the little boy with him day and night. I have heard complaints about the way the boy was treated … The child was hungry.”\n\nThe decision by the court was an odd one. On Jan. 21, the magistrate ruled that, “There [being] no allegation of dishonesty against [the father], I discharged him … The little boy I formally ordered to be committed to the Westbrook Reformatory School for boys for seven years.”\n\nWestbrook Reformatory was a tough and unforgiving place, especially, as noted by the magistrate, for “a child of tender years,” barely five years old. And so on Feb. 5, Westbrook received a letter from the undersecretary of Brisbane (Queensland’s) Home Secretary’s Office saying, “His Excellency the Governor … has been pleased to remit the unexpired portion of the sentence of detention for seven years … upon [the boy], who was convicted on a charge of being a neglected child.”\n\nThe boy was released to the Diamatina Orphanage on the premise that his father would pay for a portion of his upkeep—common practice at the time. But on April 12, 1913, the Allora rail station in Toowoomba reported that the father “was constantly in the company of drunkards and men of doubtful character” and was unable to pay the needed sums for his son. “He is a man who does very little work and is living from hand to mouth,” the Allora station chief reported.\n\nFrom then on, the child’s destiny takes on a Dickensian arc. He is doled out to a series of foster homes, one so cruel as to tie him by his ankle at night to an outdoor post, waking him in the predawn hours to deliver milk by horse-drawn carriage. He becomes an “apprentice”—a euphemism for something akin to indenture—in a tool shop, working lathes during the day and sleeping on the shop floor at night. At the age of 14, his teeth are so rotten they are replaced by false ones. Eventually, at the age of 17, he is released to the care of a Mr. and Mrs. Newsome. He marries their daughter. They take him by ship to South Africa, where he becomes a bus driver, forms a partnership with a Xhosa, ends up buying the bus and then another—and eventually owns more buses than the South African government will tolerate of an Aussie and a black.[1]\n\nThey are taken out of the business at an unfair price, but for the first time, he has money. He falls in love with the daughter of a widowed Norwegian woman who cooks for a boarding house. He divorces the Newsome girl and marries the woman he truly loves. With savings in hand, they set sail for the Promised Land, America, only to discover that his record and lack of documentation make him inadmissible. He retreats to Tijuana, Mexico, where he outsmarts the bookies at the horse track and crisscrosses the border to sell cars for eight years before he is admitted for U.S. citizenship. He then hires out as muscle to collect a payment in Shanghai for the Spazier Chemical and Soap Co. In Shanghai, his wife becomes pregnant; they leave Shanghai on the second-to-last ship to sail from China before Mao’s forces close the port. They dock in Los Angeles, and he sets about working countless jobs in countless places: He sells tools and silver in Mexico, airplanes in Indonesia, used cars in Florida, men’s suits in New York and women’s undergarments in the Caribbean, retiring at 80 as the self-heralded “bra king of the Caribbean.” He dies in Austin, Texas, two weeks after his 90th birthday.\n\nThe son who was conceived in Shanghai and born in Los Angeles ends up at Harvard studying economics; he graduates with honors, goes on to Oxford and earns an MBA from Stanford and then works at the private bank of Brown Brothers Harriman. From there, he builds his own investment firm in Dallas before becoming an ambassador and deputy minister of trade for the United States and, ultimately, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nOf course, that son is me; the little boy found sleeping on the streets in Maryborough and begging for food is my father.\n\nIn one generation, a great shift occurred: from homeless to Harvard; from a brutal reformatory in Queensland to the great banking house of Brown Brothers Harriman in New York; from being tied by the ankle at night in the yard behind a foster home to living in the tony neighborhood of Highland Park, Texas; from working lathes during the day and sleeping on the shop floor at night to becoming president and CEO of this $114 billion Federal Reserve Bank and a member of the Federal Open Market Committee—a group of 19 that decides monetary policy for the world’s most powerful economy.\n\nIt is a hell of a story—a quintessential American story. It has happened time and again, not just to tough, determined, adventurous Aussies like my father escaping his past, but to Irishmen escaping famine, Jews escaping tyranny, Mexicans, Haitians, Vietnamese, Chinese and Filipinos, all seeking a better life. Just yesterday, I hopped in a cab in New York. The driver was a young man from Tibet who had won a lottery slot to immigrate to the U.S. “I am never going back,” he said. “I am going to build a life for my family right here.” As Peggy Noonan wrote this weekend, “Here is American openness—meaning if you are open to it, it will be open to you.”[2]\n\nEvery time I lift my fork in this beautiful dining room, I say a silent little prayer of thanks for what American openness and Australian gumption have given me. Today, I say thanks for being asked to host the Australian American Leadership Dialogue—for being able to join my past with my present.\n\nThank you for being here.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "June 26, 2012 Dallas, Texas\n\nThank you, Max [Wells], for that kind introduction.\n\nWe are on the eve of the Federal Reserve’s 100th anniversary, the third and longest-lasting central bank in the history of the United States. And this year, we are celebrating the 20th anniversary of this wonderful building. Thank you, Ebby Halliday, for joining us. Ebby, you are two years and nine months older than we are! It is a pleasure to speak history to a woman who has lived it.\n\nGeorge Dealey: Patron Saint of the Dallas Fed\n\nYou now know that this is probably the only Reserve Bank that owes its location to the local newspaper—in our case, the Dallas Morning News\n\nAfter Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act in December 1913 and President Wilson signed it, cities around the nation immediately started competing to be the home of a Federal Reserve Bank. The act established a Reserve Bank Organization Committee to select “not less than eight nor more than twelve” cities to host a Reserve Bank. The secretary of the treasury, comptroller of the currency and secretary of agriculture were designated to serve on that committee.\n\nDallas, Fort Worth and Houston all expressed interest in a Reserve Bank, as did New Orleans. Across the nation, more than 40 cities wanted a Federal Reserve Bank.\n\nAmong Texas cities, Dallas was the odds-on favorite. Fort Worth made a pretty good effort, despite having only 73,312 residents—some 5,000 less than Houston and well short of the 131,278 of the population of Dallas. However, Fort Worth’s representative may have been tripped up by being a tad parochial: He noted that they had 13 rail connections. Asked by a member of the Reserve Bank Organization Committee if one of those connections was to Dallas, the spokesman replied, “Yes, but we seldom use it.”\n\nBut no Texas city had the inside lead held by New Orleans: At the time, it was the 15th-largest city in America, had a population over three times larger than Dallas and had an active financial community centered on Mississippi River commerce. Besides, as Stuart would no doubt understand, gourmand that he is, any official worth his salt would have rather been wined and dined at Galatoire’s or Antoine’s than at any eatery in what was then Little—rather than Big—“D”.\n\nDallas, however, had something that New Orleans did not have—a force of nature named George Dealey. Mr. Dealey was the publisher of the Dallas Morning News. In manner and character, he was quite the polar opposite of New Orleans’ “laissez les bon temps rouler” ethic. Dealey lived by the dictum that “men who exist get overrun by men who act.”[1] When he learned of the potential of hosting a Federal Reserve Bank, he enacted a no-holds-barred action plan to secure the franchise for Dallas.\n\nMuch Ado About McAdoo\n\nDealey organized a pro-Dallas rally in Washington. He encouraged studies to make the case for our city. He lobbied the Reserve Bank Organization Committee. These were the visible parts of his campaign. He applied his most effective techniques sub-rosa: He adroitly harvested his friendship with an influential member of the Wilson administration—Postmaster General Albert Burleson—with an eye to ultimately convince the secretary of the treasury, William McAdoo.\n\nBurleson was a native Texan, with whom Dealey often corresponded through coded telegrams, using names like “Mercury” and “Tacitus”—the Dallas Historical Society has those original telegrams, along with other artifacts relating to our founding, on hand in the dining room tonight. Thanks to a man named Otto Prager—the postmaster of Washington and a loyal former Dealey employee—Mr. Dealey heard that Burleson would be traveling by train from St. Louis to Dallas. So he dispatched Dallas Morning News reporter Tom Finty and Dallas Clearing House executive Howard Ardrey to St. Louis. There, they boarded the train and “accidentally” ran into Postmaster General Burleson. By the time the train arrived in Dallas, Burleson was convinced that our city deserved a Federal Reserve Bank.\n\nAt Dealey’s urging, Burleson contacted Treasury Secretary McAdoo and argued the merits of selecting Dallas, backed up by this document here, pulled together by the Dallas Chamber, the Dallas Clearing House and the Dallas Cotton Exchange.\n\n\n\n“Our argument,” the document summarized in its cover memo, “is particularly developed for the City of Dallas; the largest city west of the Mississippi River, and south of the Missouri, with unexcelled railroad facilities and mail service; the telegraph, telephone and express development ranking with the seven largest cities in the United States. We present for your distinguished consideration a city now the acknowledged market of the Southwest, the distributing and financial center of the most progressive and rapidly developing section of the United States.”[2]\n\nPerusing this document, one gets a glimpse into Texas bravado and the art of promotion: As I mentioned, there were only 131,278 people residing in Dallas versus 339,075 in New Orleans.[3] But, the document noted, Dallas had grown by 116 percent between 1900 and 1910 and by 41.7 percent in just the four years from 1904 to 1909—versus a measly growth rate of 18 percent for New Orleans in the decade and a decline of 3.6 percent during the same four-year period. “Within 100 miles of Dallas,” the document claimed, “there are 1,486,041 people which is 24,582 more than there are within 100 miles of Kansas City.”[4] Kansas City and St. Louis were both considered shoe-ins for hosting Federal Reserve Banks, so the document went on to note that “Dallas has the largest telephone development per capita of any city in the United States” and “leads the world in the manufacture of cotton gin machinery and in the manufacture of harness and saddlery” and “sells more goods … than either St. Louis or Kansas City, and particularly surpasses them … in automobiles, cement, drugs and groceries … hats and caps, machinery, paper, petroleum products [and] paints and oils.”[5]\n\nOur own Bob Strauss could not have contrived a more aggressive sales pitch. Ebby Halliday could not have packaged it and sold it more skillfully. And even Lyndon Johnson couldn’t have more adroitly harbored and then played the trump card that Dealey and Burleson held deep in their pockets: Treasury Secretary McAdoo. They knew his preferences and style and honed their message to him, so much so that when the hearings were over, McAdoo remarked privately that, “Whoever prepared this brief did a damn good job and knew what the word ‘brief’ means.” Secretary McAdoo was not only a key player on the Reserve Bank Organization Committee, he was married to Woodrow Wilson’s daughter. He decided for Dallas and, voilà, we were selected as the headquarters for the 11th of 12 Federal Reserve Districts.\n\nGeorge Dealey had secured his legacy as patron saint of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Little did he know at the time what a big “dealey” that would be.\n\n“Buy a Few Chairs and Pine-Top Tables”\n\nThe Dallas Fed received its “certificate of organization” on May 18, 1914. The initial instructions from Secretary McAdoo to each Federal Reserve Bank were also brief: “Buy a few chairs and pine-top tables. Hire some clerks and stenographers, paint ‘Federal Reserve Bank’ on your office door and open up. The way to begin is to begin. When you make a start, everything will be smoothed out by practice.”[6]\n\nI think of McAdoo every time I wrestle with the 2,000 pages, 16 titles, 38 subtitles and 541 sections of Dodd–Frank. Were the mandates we receive from Washington these days so simple and clear!\n\nThe Dallas Fed bought a few chairs and tables, hired a staff of 27 at an average pay of $30 a month, and on Nov. 16, 1914, opened for business in a space rented at 1309 Main St.—presumably painting “Federal Reserve Bank” above its office door. The Bank did not have its own vault, so it borrowed one about the size of a phone booth from a local bank. Today our vault is the size of a five-story building and occupies 571,590 cubic feet; you walked right over it when you made your way to this dining room.\n\nThe Dallas Fed’s 27 employees worked hard to make loans to member banks and began implementing a system to process checks totally from scratch. They also began putting Federal Reserve Bank notes and Federal Reserve notes into circulation, eventually replacing National Bank notes, which was the currency of the day. Here is an example of a National Bank note issued by Frost National Bank of San Antonio; we dug it out of our vaults just last Friday, and it is similar to other bank notes that will be on exhibit in our foyer. It is signed in Indian ink by the Frost Bank cashier and its president, Joe Frost, the uncle of Tom Frost, who served on our board of directors from 1988 to 1993. Today, Frost Bank is the third-largest commercial bank headquartered in the region, and its stock has consistently outperformed an index of publicly traded banks nationwide; it is supervised by the Dallas Fed.\n\n\n\nHere is one of the first Federal Reserve Bank notes put into circulation following before the Federal Reserve Act.\n\n\n\nYou will notice the “11-K” that is printed on its face. The letter “K” is the 11th letter in the English alphabet; hence, this is a “Dallas” or “Eleventh District dollar.” To this day, dollar bills ordered and circulated by the Dallas Fed feature prominently the letter “K” on their face, surrounded by two concentric circles. The outer circle says “Federal Reserve” and “Texas,” and the inner circle says “Bank of” and Dallas.”\n\n\n\nWorld War I, the 1920s and Ramsey’s Leap\n\nAs World War I heated up, the Dallas Fed worked with the Treasury Department to help fund the war by selling Liberty Loan Bonds. That required the Bank to expand its vault space, construct additional teller cages and lease temporary offices in nearby buildings. By all accounts, the war bond effort was successful as the proceeds of sales filled the existing vault to capacity.\n\nWhen our El Paso, Houston and San Antonio branches were established, employees moved from Dallas to those cities so those branches could serve customers as soon as their doors opened. Having a Federal Reserve office contributed greatly to the industrial growth of El Paso, Houston and San Antonio.\n\nThe El Paso Branch was the first to open, on June 17, 1918. There wasn’t much between Dallas and Los Angeles, and a Federal Reserve office was needed to distribute cash to commercial banks in the southwest. Our El Paso Branch still serves as a cash distribution center—along with a cash depot in Phoenix.\n\nAfter a six-year stay at a second home on Commerce Street, the Dallas Fed constructed its own building at 400 S. Akard St. in 1921.\n\n\n\nThis solid, ornate building would be our homefor 71 years, until the building we are in tonight opened in 1992. The Akard Street office had the distinction of being one of the first—if not the first—building west of the Mississippi to have air conditioning. I suspect that perk made the Dallas Fed a popular place to work. And its architecture made for an imposing structure. The city of Dallas has designated that building a historical landmark. It sold just last week to San Francisco-based Digital Realty Trust Inc., which cited its “large floor-plates, high ceilings, and robust floor loading making it an attractive alternative for customers in the Dallas area looking for high quality data center space.”[7] No one can say that the Federal Reserve doesn’t build things of lasting value.\n\nIn 1920–21, the nation experienced a brief depression. One of my favorite stories of the period occurred in May 1921 at the Security National Bank, not too far from where we are dining this evening. A rumor spread that the bank was in trouble, and it suddenly was being overrun by panicked customers withdrawing their money. They called the Dallas Fed for help. Just in the nick of time, the chairman of the Dallas Fed, W.F. Ramsey, showed up in an armored car with guards and hauled a quarter-million dollars into the lobby where everyone could see it. Ramsey jumped on a desk and shouted across the crowded lobby that there was $30 million more sitting in the Fed’s vault down the street, so they could quit panicking. That ended the bank run.\n\nI tell that story to our current chairman, Herb Kelleher, and his eyes sparkle. I can just see him doing the same thing, except he would more likely have declared that there were 30 million bottles of Wild Turkey down the street, so they should quit fretting and join him for a drink!\n\nIn a sense, what Ramsey did at that bank in 1921 is pretty much what the Federal Reserve did in 2008–09 to prevent a collapse of the financial system. Rather than having Ben Bernanke or me and my counterparts in the 11 other Fed banks running in to banks and jumping up on desks, the Fed created lending facilities such as the Term Auction Facility, the Primary Credit Dealer Facility and the Term Securities Lending Facility, to stem the fear and panic that threatened global economic collapse. Those actions were a little more sophisticated than what W.F. Ramsey did in 1921, but the concept is pretty much the same. Money and banking, in the end, is a confidence game, and our job at the Federal Reserve is to preserve confidence.\n\nUltimately, the 1920s turned out to be a prosperous decade for the Eleventh District and its banks. In 1927, deposits in the district reached $1 billion, up from $312 million in 1914.\n\nFed and Ginger\n\nOver time, the Dallas Fed developed a reputation for providing reliable, high-quality services to its member banks, acting primarily as a supplier of currency and coin, and providing centralized check-clearing operations. A bundle of checks would arrive at the Bank, and employees would spend the night sorting them by hand. Check clearing was particularly monotonous work, so the employees in the check department would make their own entertainment: Back in the 1920s, night check employees would sing while doing their jobs. One employee was such a good singer that his coworkers encouraged him to hit the stage. So this fellow, a man named Jack Culpepper, worked up an act and hit the vaudeville circuit under the stage name of “Jack Pepper.” Soon, he was joined by another vaudevillian, a dancer named Ginger. They got married and performed as “Ginger and Pepper.” Unfortunately, the marriage didn’t last long, and Ginger found another dance partner. His name was Fred Astaire. Her name, of course, was Ginger Rogers. Poor Jack Culpepper’s career never recovered—neither at the Dallas Fed nor on the dance stage. But in his honor, here at the Bank we refer to the most famous of dance duos as “Fed and Ginger,” for if it hadn’t been for our own Jack Culpepper, Ms. Rogers would never have found Mr. Astaire.\n\nThe Great Depression: Plus ça change …\n\nDuring the Great Depression, our employees rallied and did their part to serve the Eleventh District and the nation. Here is what my predecessor from the period, R.R. Gilbert, wrote in his memoirs:\n\n“During the early months [of 1933], northern and eastern states had experienced widespread banking difficulties with deposits declining sharply, increased hoarding of currency and gold … and many bank failures. This condition became progressively worse and on March 6, [President Roosevelt] issued a proclamation directing all banking institutions in the country to observe a ‘bank holiday.’ … On March 13, the reserve banks and all licensed member banks in the 12 Federal Reserve districts were authorized to reopen. … 574 member banks out of a membership of 588 applied to this bank to re-open. 515 were licensed then and by the middle of April, 16 additional banks were licensed. The 43 remaining banks were not licensed to reopen. … During succeeding weeks … reserve bank officials made every possible effort to help those institutions get their affairs in order to permit their reopening. Some of the banks were placed in the hands of ‘conservators’ [and] some were consolidated with other institutions. … The Banking Act of 1933 was passed shortly and … the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was set up which materially assisted in restoring public confidence in the banking system.”[8]\n\nDuring this time, Congress also authorized the Federal Reserve to lend to individuals, firms and corporations to promote economic activity under exigent circumstances. Plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose. The Fed used this same authority during the 2008–09 financial crisis to help prevent another Great Depression. And Congress passed the Dodd–Frank Act to restore public confidence in the banking system. We shall only know with the passage of time if Dodd–Frank, and the implementation of its dictates by regulators such as the Federal Reserve, will do the trick.\n\nThe “Keepers of the Bank”\n\nIt is important to bear in mind that after a financial crisis of grand proportions, it takes time for the economy to heal. The Depression worsened after the Banking Act of 1933 and the establishment of the FDIC. The worsening economy affected the Dallas Fed’s culture, sometimes in ways that would be unimaginable today. For example, as the national unemployment rate rose to 25 percent, the bank instituted a policy to expand job opportunities for married men who were supporting families. That policy mandated that no married woman was allowed to work for the Bank or its branches. A similar policy today would most definitely be frowned upon by my first vice president and chief operating officer, Helen Holcomb; by my chief financial officer, Meredith Black; the head of supervision and regulation, Ann Worthy; and Joanna Kolson, the senior vice president who oversees our vaults and facilities. And I am certain it would become the subject of immediate litigation by our in-house attorney, Sharon Sweeney. Not long ago, the Dallas Morning News wrote a fine piece on “The Keepers of the Bank,” highlighting the fact that we have more women in senior leadership positions at the Dallas Fed than just about any other major business in Dallas.[9] I am very proud of the remarkable women, and men, who are my partners in operating this Bank.\n\nWorld War II to Date\n\nAs the night is long, I will not go much further down memory lane, except to point out that during World War II, 270 Dallas Fed employees served in the military, including the chairman of the board, Jay Taylor, who served as a major in the U.S. Army. Employees entering military service were guaranteed reemployment, restoration of retirement benefits and one month’s salary upon return. In the years following the war, the Bank instituted health benefits, a formal vacation policy and a 40-hour workweek. We have always been a community and nationally minded institution and have been at the vanguard of many progressive changes in personnel policies.\n\nGeorge Dealey’s Dream Realized\n\nTo wrap up, I’ll skip ahead to the present. When the Dallas Fed opened, there were 27 employees; today we have 1,350. The Bank had $21.8 million in assets after its first year in business; we closed last year with a $113 billion balance sheet. In the last census taken before the Fed’s founding, Dallas was the 58th-largest city in America and Houston was the 68th. Today, Houston proper is the fourth-largest American city and Dallas, the ninth—and we do have an active railroad connection with our dear friends and collaborators in Fort Worth. Texas is now the second-largest state with over 25 million residents.\n\nThe Eleventh Federal Reserve District has outpaced the other Federal Reserve districts in employment growth and growth of output.\n\n\n\nTexas—which accounts for about 96 percent of the Eleventh District’s economic output—is by far the leading exporting state and has the nation’s second-largest manufacturing base. Our state produces more oil than Norway and almost as much natural gas as Canada despite having only 2 percent of our workforce employed in energy production and mining and related services. That 2 percent, plus the other 98 percent of our state’s workforce, has experienced growth that has far outpaced the rest of the nation for the past two decades and longer.\n\n\n\nWe’ve even outpaced the major global economies in job growth, as well as the great resource-intensive countries of Canada and Australia.\n\n\n\nWe’ve come a long way from just leading the world in the manufacture of cotton gin machinery and of harness and saddlery, and selling more hats and caps than Kansas City or St. Louis. If anything, George Dealey’s chutzpah and the hyperbolic presentation made by the Dallas Chamber, the Clearing House Association and the Cotton Exchange to Secretary McAdoo and the Reserve Bank Organizers of 1913 was understated. Texas has become one of the most powerful pistons in the economic engine of 21st century America. It took great vision to imagine that 100 years ago.\n\nAs history buffs, you are all familiar with T.R. Fehrenbach, who wrote the classic Lone Star: A History of Texas and the Texans. Let me quote from that great book: “The Texan ethic and Texas society rewarded enterprise. … Work was the real virtue. We chose this land; we took it; we made it bear fruit.”[10] George Dealey and his friends chose this city, took the Federal Reserve franchise and made it bear fruit. I couldn’t be more blessed than having the privilege nearly a century later to lead this enterprising Bank and represent the hard-working, virtuous citizens of the Eleventh Federal Reserve District in the policy forums of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThank you all.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "June 7, 2012 La Jolla, California\n\nI am honored to speak at this conference on the internationalization of the renminbi. It is a very timely topic, particularly since China has recently accelerated the pace of currency reform. Before I delve into these weighty matters, however, I’d like to mention my embryonic connection to the People’s Republic of China (PRC).\n\nIn 1948, my father, accompanied by my mother, was sent to Shanghai to collect a dollar payment owed to the U.S.-based Spazier Chemical and Soap Co. They left the Peace Hotel and Shanghai right before the People’s Liberation Army closed the port, my father with payment in hand and my mother with child; I was born in Los Angeles five months later. It is thus no exaggeration to say that I have literally had an interest in China my entire life, something that my Chinese interlocutors have wryly noted. When I was deputy U.S. trade representative helping Charlene Barshefsky negotiate China’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), Madam Wu Yi—the tough-as-nails “Iron Lady” of China—used to say, “I like Ambassador Fisher because he was manufactured in China.”\n\nSusan [Shirk], I am grateful for your invitation to let a lifetime China watcher speak here today.\n\nThis afternoon, I will discuss the prospects for the internationalization of the renminbi and conclude with some thoughts on the implications for the United States going forward. For those of you who are up-to-the-minute in touch with all matters Chinese, I trust nothing I say will make its way into Yang Rui’s microblog or feed the suspicions of the editors of the People’s Daily (and please note that I am from Texas, not Oklahoma!).[1], [2] I seek neither to “demonize” nor impose a “colonial” view on China, nor do I wish to fawn over her. My comments today merely draw upon the facts, from lessons learned as a student of economics and from my personal experiences in China.\n\nMost of you are aware that China announced a series of foreign exchange policy measures in the past couple of months. The renminbi’s daily trading band around the U.S. dollar has widened from 0.5 percent to 1 percent. In addition, HSBC recently placed 2-billion-yuan bonds in London, the first renminbi bond issue outside mainland China and Hong Kong.[3] China now allows some domestic banks to hold overnight long positions of renminbi. In other words, these banks can short foreign currencies, such as the dollar, if they wish. All of these policy changes demonstrate China’s determination to reform its exchange-rate policy and, I believe, its ultimate ambition to transform the renminbi into a leading global currency.\n\nIn the long run, a fully convertible currency and flexible exchange-rate regime are good for both China and the world economy. These recent reforms, then, are welcomed as a step in the right direction. However, overhauling a country’s exchange-rate regime and inspiring confidence from international investors are lengthy processes, and Chinese policymakers must bear in mind the risks associated with capital account liberalization. Before discussing some of these risks, I would like to first offer my take on the Chinese economy from a broader perspective.\n\nChina has undergone two crucial stages of transformation that have seen its economy progress from a closed and centrally planned system to one more open and fueled by the private sector. The first stage occurred in the early 1980s, when Deng Xiaoping shifted the country’s attention from extreme political ideology to economic development. Following his famous arguments that “poverty is not socialism” and “to be rich is glorious,” China’s domestic production became more responsive to dictates from the market than from the political power structure.\n\nThe second stage arrived in 2001, when China joined the WTO and became more actively engaged in global production activities. China’s international trade exploded, and the country quickly ascended to become the world’s largest supplier of manufactured goods.\n\nI am grateful to have played roles, however minor, in both of these remarkable transformations. As mentioned, I served as deputy U.S. trade representative in the Clinton administration from 1997 to 2001 and was a member of the team that negotiated the bilateral accords for China's accession to the WTO. In the late 1970s, I served in the Carter administration as coordinator of policy planning and assistant to Treasury Secretary Michael Blumenthal, helping to normalize the China–U.S. trade relationship.\n\nOn Feb. 23, 1979, Secretary Blumenthal and his team—which included me as his faithful chef de cabinet—flew to Beijing to meet with Deng Xiaoping and other senior government officials. The mission of the trip was to settle the counterclaims between the U.S. and China stemming from the communist takeover in 1949. Soon after that change, the PRC seized railroad stock and other U.S. assets invested in Chiang Kai-shek’s government. In retaliation, the U.S. froze the assets of Chinese account-holders in U.S. banks. Obviously, normal trade was impossible without resolving this dispute. After arduous negotiations with Deng and Finance Minister Zhang Jin-fu, we sealed a preliminary deal to settle these counterclaims on March 1, 1979, and on that very day, reopened the U.S. embassy in Beijing.\n\nHere are two of my favorite mementos from that negotiation. The first is our joint negotiating “team” picture. The young fellow towering over Deng Xiaoping is me, if, indeed, anybody could “tower over” what some historians consider the leading transformational figure of the 20th century.[4]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second is the cover photo on the March 3 issue of the People’s Daily. This picture depicts Chairman Hua Guofeng, Mao Zedong’s placeholder successor, escorting Secretary Blumenthal (left), Undersecretary Tony Solomon (who later became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) and, behind them, me and the rest of our delegation into the Great Hall of the People.\n\n\n\nChina has experienced tremendous change since those photos were taken 33 years ago. During our trip to Beijing in 1979, we barely saw any cars on the street other than our own motorcade. The best data we have estimates that China produced only 5,000 cars in 1980, most all for officialdom. In 2009, China surpassed the United States in the annual volume of auto output and sales for the first time. In 2010, more than 9.5 million passenger cars were manufactured in China, while auto sales reached 18.5 million units in 2011.\n\nDeng’s economic reforms have fueled the rapid expansion of China’s economy. During our settlement-of-claims discussions, Deng said during an informal session what he later repeated publicly in Guangdong: “It doesn’t matter if the cat is white or black as long as it catches mice.” Well, China has caught plenty of mice—gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in 2011 is more than 14 times greater than what it was in 1980.[5] China is now the second-largest economy in the world.\n\nAlong with these remarkable achievements, what has impressed me deeply about the Chinese has been their willingness to adopt and adapt. China started down the road to economic reform in the early 1980s by allowing private production in rural areas. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of the Soviet Union and economic liberalization in India in the 1980s and 1990s, it became clear that the centrally planned economic model was unsustainable. As a response, the pace of reform in China accelerated in the 1990s. The PRC removed its state-owned enterprises from many sectors to foster private activity and removed migration restrictions to encourage labor mobility across regions, especially to coastal areas and, most recently, inland.\n\nWhile the people of China are eager for economic reform, policymakers are usually more cautious. This emphasis on balance and patience is captured by Deng’s famous dictum to “cross the river by touching the stones.” Such gradual changes have thus far worked very well for China, compared with many countries that attempted a quick switch from a centrally planned economy to a market-based system. In the last 20 years, China hasn’t fallen prone to bouts of crises that plagued many of its emerging-economy counterparts. Its GDP growth rate has remained at 8 percent or above for most of the past three decades.\n\nChina, however, now finds itself at another inflection point. Many emerging markets experience rapid economic growth when they first open to the global economy. The reallocation of labor and other resources in these countries toward the sectors in which they have comparative advantages results in rapid productivity gains. An inflow of new technologies and the capital to finance their adoption also moves the country’s production to higher frontiers and often brings about explosive economic growth. Except for a few notable exceptions, such as Japan and South Korea, many emerging economies have been unable to sustain this pace of expansion, slowing sharply long before their per-capita income approaches levels seen in advanced economies such as the U.S.—enveloping them in what some economists call the “middle-income trap.”[6]\n\nIn the last few months, many business operators and economists have shared with me their concerns regarding rising labor costs in China. Several provincial governments have dictated some dramatic mandatory minimum-wage increases—in 2011, Chongqing mandated an increase of 32 percent, Shandong 26 percent and Beijing 20 percent. According to a recent report from the Boston Consulting Group, by 2015 the total labor cost savings of manufacturing in China will only be about 10 to 15 percent when labor productivity is taken into account.[7] After factoring in transportation costs and operational efficiencies, it has become more economical for some manufacturing companies to shift production to other low-cost countries, such as Vietnam and Mexico and, in some cases, even to the United States. Indeed, with increasing frequency, I’ve noticed news articles documenting tire, steel, appliance and even television manufacturers shifting production back to the U.S.[8] These increasing labor costs indicate that the pool of competitively priced labor in China may be close to drying up and that economic growth sustained by simply reallocating labor to the sectors where China enjoys a comparative advantage is nearing an end.\n\nConsequently, China will likely have to rely on increasing economic efficiency to maintain rapid growth because an economic growth model based primarily on investment for export is presumed unsustainable in the long run. This begs the question: How can Chinese policymakers facilitate increases in economic efficiency and change the growth model? Prudent first steps lie in harnessing creative destruction and promoting competition to boost efficiency in overregulated sectors dominated by state-owned enterprises.\n\nTo that end, reforming China’s financial sector is a critical step in providing long-run growth sustainability. Lessons and warnings from other emerging economies, whose lack of financial sector efficiency and transparency keeps them mired in the middle-income trap, are well known. China’s economic miracle may face the same pitfall if it does not reform its financial sector.\n\nThis process of liberalization was codified in China’s accession to the WTO. Upon entrance, China agreed to liberalize its financial sector, and timetables and deadlines were negotiated on when pre-WTO restrictions on foreign ownership and access to foreign and local-currency markets would expire. China agreed that within five years of WTO accession, foreign financial institutions would be permitted to provide services to all Chinese clients and geographic restrictions on where these institutions could conduct business were to be lifted. China has fallen behind on this schedule; many of the hurdles foreign firms faced before China’s accession to the WTO remain.\n\nChina’s recent foreign exchange policy reforms, such as the announcement of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) authorizing direct renminbi–yen trading, are small steps in the right direction, and I expect China to continue crossing this river, albeit by feeling the stones along the way. After all, it is hard to imagine that the world’s second-largest economy will maintain a fixed exchange rate and a tightly controlled capital account forever.\n\nI have two convictions regarding the internationalization of the renminbi and China’s capital account liberalization. First, I believe China should accelerate changes to improve the quality of domestic financial institutions before relaxing many of its capital account restrictions. Second, I expect China will adopt a posture of gradualism when internationalizing its currency.\n\nUnlike trade liberalization, the consequences from capital account reforms are more nuanced. Capital account liberalization increases the efficiency of the global economy by allowing international capital to flow to the country that needs it most. However, rapid cross-border capital flows may also deal a severe blow to an individual country’s capital account, unleashing a dynamic that can end in tears—predicating a financial crisis followed by a prolonged and painful recession. Examples of the danger of unsustainable international capital flows to emerging economies abound— in much of Latin America throughout the 1980s and in the downturns in Mexico and some Asian countries in the 1990s. As the recent financial crisis demonstrated, even so-called advanced economies are not immune. The last thing we want to see is a similar crisis in an economy the size of China’s.\n\nHistory teaches that the benefit of capital account liberalization depends on the maturity of the domestic financial sector, with more developed, well-regulated structures yielding greater rewards from greater capital account openness. When a country has relatively deep financial markets to handle the ebbs and flows of rapid capital movements, it is less vulnerable to financial crises, especially if those markets are properly regulated. High-quality, prudently regulated financial institutions also help direct capital inflows to those sectors with the highest productivity. However, if institutions are weak and structurally unsound and regulation is precarious, liberalization can be a bane rather than a boon to economic growth. We have experienced this even in the deepest and most advanced marketplace in the world—the United States.\n\nWe know the conditions under which capital account liberalization turns out well for emerging economies, but the trillion-dollar question remains: Is China ready to face the full implications of these reforms?\n\nChina has made moderate progress upgrading its financial sector over the past 20 years. However, several concerns remain, making the outcome of liberalization unclear. Right now, the most important price in the Chinese financial marketplace—the interest rate on bank loans—is not yet fully determined by the market. Just yesterday, the PBOC gave banks some leeway for lending rates, announcing that they will be allowed to lend at as much as 20 percent, from 10 percent, below the official rate. But, essentially, the PBOC still dictates both interest rates charged and the amount of loans commercial banks can make.\n\nMoreover, China’s securities markets, especially for bonds, are less developed than other major financial markets. In 2011, the outstanding stock of debt securities issued domestically amounted to $26.3 trillion in the U.S., compared with just $3.3 trillion in China. Bond liquidity remains very low in China; in fact, most debt securities are held until maturity and never traded. China’s equity market is also relatively small and shallow. The capitalization of the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges is about 80 percent lower than the combined market capitalization of the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market. Indeed, in many areas of financial market depth and breadth—foreign exchange turnover, exchange-traded derivative contracts, funds management assets, hedge fund assets and private equity—China trails not only the United States, but also Britain, Japan, France, Germany and Singapore.\n\nIt should be acknowledged that China has undertaken significant steps to reform its banks. Some, especially those that are publicly listed, operate similarly to their western counterparts. However, many loans are still dictated by administrative policy orders rather than by economic efficiency. State-owned enterprises usually have easier access to credit and more favorable loan terms than private enterprises receiving loans from state-owned banks. To increase banking sector efficiency, China should remove entry barriers to allow domestic private banks to enter and equally compete with state-owned banks. The “big four” state-owned banks dominate the Chinese banking industry, and their too-big-to-fail status and explicit government support undermine market discipline, just as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the too-big-to-fail banks do here in the United States.\n\nAllowing more domestic competitors in the banking sector can help alleviate this issue. In the case of China, policymakers will need to operate state-owned banks based on a robust, prudentially regulated but profit-seeking model to fully embrace market reforms and the competition from domestic and foreign private banks that such reforms entail. On May 26, the China Banking Regulatory Commission relaxed some restrictions for private investors to participate in the banking sector. I was pleased to see such changes and hope China’s policymakers follow up with additional reforms to encourage transparency and fair competition in the banking sector.\n\nIn addition to China’s present domestic financial market infrastructure, the current domestic and international economic landscape is hardly hospitable to rapid capital account liberalization in China.\n\nFollowing the global financial crisis in 2008, the Chinese government stimulated its economy with a 4-trillion-yuan package, or about $585 billion, an intervention far more aggressive than that chosen by any other major economy, especially relative to China’s GDP. The stimulus package cushioned the country’s economy from the collapse of international demand for Chinese exports, but it also created unpleasant effects that policymakers must now confront. Inflationary pressures have eased following the PBOC’s tightening monetary policy in the last two years. However, asset bubbles in the real estate market and mounting local government debt remain serious threats to China’s financial outlook.\n\nDuring the recent credit boom fueled by the 4-trillion-yuan fiscal stimulus, off-balance-sheet lending by banks and private loans by nonbanks exploded. This shadow-banking lending activity accounted for an estimated 20 percent of China’s total loans in 2011. With the cooling of the real estate market and with slower economic growth likely in the near term, a large share of these loans could turn bad. And because these loans took place outside the view of regulators, the effect of a sudden disruption in repayment is virtually impossible to predict.\n\nOn the international front, the sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone has resulted in much uncertainty and volatility in global financial markets. Should there be, say, a sudden and messy change in the participants in the economic and monetary union, a chain reaction might ensue that could result in some unpleasant responses. Just two weekends ago, for example, the Swiss National Bank warned that it is considering capital controls on foreign deposits if Greece leaves the euro zone. Clearly, any policy shifts affecting China’s capital account must recognize the current fragility of global financial markets.\n\nI would like to conclude my remarks with a few thoughts on the implications for the United States of an internationally traded renminbi.\n\nMy erudite friend, Barry Eichengreen, will speak to you tomorrow morning. I will leave in-depth analysis for the future prospects of the U.S. dollar in his capable hands. Suffice it to say that for now, the U.S. dollar enjoys an “exorbitant privilege” as the dominant international currency. Despite the best efforts of the Congress of the United States to fritter away that privilege through reckless fiscal policy, I do not expect the supremacy of the dollar to face an immediate challenge.\n\nIt takes time for a major global currency to emerge and even more time for it to become dominant. Until recently, the dollar had no serious competitors for that status. But the creation of the euro—despite its current pathology—and the rise of new, ambitious economies like China threaten to challenge the dollar’s dominant role, and the privileges that come with that dominance, at some point.\n\nYet, it is important to remember that dominant global currencies benefit from inertia, and old habits die hard. Standard practices and norms evolve only gradually when people use a currency in international transactions over a long period, and it takes time to convince businesses and central banks that a new currency is worth holding in significant magnitudes. The liquidity and the stability of the currency, and the government behind that currency, are kept under close watch to see if it will pass the muster as an effective store of value and medium of exchange on a global scale. However, once a currency is chosen as the global currency, it inherits a major incumbency advantage. For example, the U.S. economy overtook the U.K. economy in the 1870s, but the U.S. dollar required at least another 50 years to replace sterling as the most important global currency. Today, more than 80 percent of all global commercial foreign-exchange trades involve the dollar on at least one side of a transaction.\n\nI do not claim that it will necessarily take more than 50 years for the renminbi to arise as a major global currency; things move more rapidly in the modern world. However, I think it safe to say that such a change will not happen overnight or even within the next decade. Besides, there is no reason for the Chinese to rush their ambition. Doing things right almost always turns out to be better than doing them quickly.\n\nPresently, the only viable alternative to the U.S. dollar in terms of deep, liquid markets is the euro. But unless you’re from the planet Mars, you know that the euro zone has its own difficulties. Despite the fiscal misfeasance in Washington, dollar-denominated government debt has remained what I have called on several occasions the “best-looking horse in the glue factory.” But relative performance is hardly comforting. And it is noteworthy that euro-denominated German bunds trade at a yield below that of U.S. Treasuries. We shouldn’t underestimate the political will among Europe’s leaders to put in place measures that will ensure that the euro comes through its present crisis, or the determination of Chinese authorities to promote the renminbi to the status of a global currency. Ultimately, we face a very real risk of having formidable competitors to the dollar in the sweepstakes for sovereign investment.\n\nIn the past 30 years, China’s economy has radically transformed from a closed and centrally planned system to a more-open and dynamic powerhouse that relies increasingly on market-based principles. Progress was made by accumulating single small steps in economic reforms, and China’s consistent and robust GDP growth lends credence to this policy of gradualism.\n\nNow China’s economy is at another crossroads. I expect that China will continue to take measured steps to liberalize its capital account and internationalize its currency. To reap the benefits of a more-open capital account, the most pressing challenge confronting China is reforming its domestic financial sector by permitting competition from the private sector and allowing the market to determine asset prices such as interest rates. Such changes can help China avoid falling into the middle-income trap and enhance sustainable economic growth.\n\nThe seemingly inexorable rise of China and the sheer size of its economy imply that the renminbi may someday play a role similar to that of the dollar. At present, it plays a very limited role on the international stage. But that role has gradually grown over time and will increase further as China’s already-large presence in the global economy expands. As Chinese policymakers lay the groundwork for the continued internationalization of the renminbi, our nation’s fiscal authorities must bear in mind that there may one day be viable alternatives to the dollar and U.S. Treasury debt as primus inter pares. The status of Treasury debt as the safest, most liquid and most desirable of all sovereign debt should not be treated as a foregone conclusion.\n\nThe privileges that status affords us will only be preserved if our fiscal authorities learn to budget responsibly. They must do so in a manner that provides our engine of economic prosperity—the private sector—with incentives to adapt and expand our economy, which in turn, anchors global confidence in America. Taking fiscal responsibility—and operating our central bank in a manner that maintains the purchasing power of the dollar—are key to defending and extending the unique position in global financial markets that the United States enjoys, and can continue to enjoy, even if China continues successfully crossing the river by touching all the right stones, catching still more of the globe’s economic mice and becoming “gloriously” richer.\n\nThank you.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "June 5, 2012 St. Andrews, Scotland\n\nThank you, Professor Sutherland. I am delighted to be here at St. Andrews and very much appreciate your organization of this meeting today. To be at the site where John Knox preached an epic sermon about Christ’s cleansing of the temple and overthrowing the money changers’ tables, which was so powerful that it led to riots against the establishment of the time, the papacy, is daunting—nearly as much so as playing the Old Course on yesterday’s bank holiday with Professor Andy Mackenzie, the university’s great scratch golfer and noted physics professor.\n\nIn a setting as august as this one—on the eve of the 600th anniversary of this great academy—and speaking on the day marking the 129th anniversary of the birth of John Maynard Keynes and the 289th anniversary of the baptism of Adam Smith in nearby Kirkcaldy—I should disclose up front that I am the least formally trained among the mostly academic economists who sit at the table where we make monetary policy at the Federal Reserve, the 19-person forum known as the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC. I have an MBA, not a PhD. I am an autodidact when it comes to monetary theory. On the other hand, I am the only participant in our policy deliberations who has been both a banker and a professional money manager—the only one who has been a market operator. What the credentialing gods denied me, the practitioner angels kindly granted me: another skill set that provides a complementary perspective to those of my more learned colleagues. I shall speak today, as I always do, only from my perspective; nothing I say represents the thinking or proclivities of other members of the FOMC. And most of what I will say will confront theory with my interpretation of the rude reality of the marketplace.\n\nA Quick Primer on the Federal Reserve’s Structure\n\nFor those of you who do not know well our central bank’s structure, a quick primer. The Federal Reserve is the third central bank in American history. We were created during Woodrow Wilson’s presidency, in the aftermath of the Financial Panic of 1907. Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act in 1913; like St. Andrews, we will mark a centennial next year, but it will be our first, while you celebrate your sixth.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Act established 12 Federal Reserve Banks, together with a Board of Governors. The members of the Board, of which Ben Bernanke is Chairman, are appointed by the president of the United States and confirmed by the Senate. The 12 Bank presidents are not: They serve at the pleasure of nine-member boards of directors composed of private bankers and citizens from their respective districts. They are distinctly nonpolitical, immune from partisan influence; they represent Main Street, not the Washington power elite or the New York money changers, just as President Wilson and the Federal Reserve founders envisioned. These are profit-making banks that perform services for the private banks in their districts: warehousing and distributing currency; operating discount windows from which banks borrow to assist in their operating funding needs; functioning as the depository for the $1.5 trillion or so in excess reserves presently piled up and going unused in our private banking system. The Banks also house and manage staff that supervise and regulate banks in the districts (under policy guidance from the Board of Governors), and perform other services, the most widely observed and commented upon of which is the operating of the open-market operations conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on behalf of all 12 Banks at the instruction of the FOMC. All 12 Bank presidents serve on the FOMC together with the seven members of the Board of Governors. This is where monetary policy for the United States is determined by collective decision. The operating procedure of the FOMC is for each of the governors to have a vote on policy; the bankers rotate their votes, with the New York Fed having a constant vote. However, all 19 members—the seven governors and the 12 bankers—participate fully in every FOMC meeting and actively contribute to policy discussions.\n\nThe FOMC has traditionally decided the federal funds rate, the overnight rate for interbank lending that anchors the yield curve. In recent years, in reaction to the Financial Panic of 2008 and 2009 and its aftermath, the FOMC has instructed the New York desk to buy mortgage-backed securities and Treasury notes and bonds—eschewing Treasury bills. Presently, the Fed holds more than $850 billion in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and over $1.6 trillion in Treasuries. This expansion of our portfolio and extension of maturities held therein is known as “quantitative easing,” or QE. After cutting the base rate for overnight lending—the fed funds rate—to zero, the majority of the committee decided to expand the money supply by purchasing MBS, notes and bonds. When we buy something in the marketplace, we pay for it, and this has resulted in significant liquidity floating about the U.S. economy, much of it going unused. As mentioned earlier, $1.5 trillion of excess reserves from private banks is on deposit in the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, where it earns a paltry 0.25 percent, rather than being lent to job-creating businesses at rates bankers would prefer. Additionally, some $2 trillion of excess cash is parked on corporate balance sheets—above and beyond the operating cash flow needs of the business sector—and copious amounts of cash are lying fallow in the pockets of nondepository financial institutions, such as private equity and other investment funds.\n\nA running discussion in the marketplace centers around whether the FOMC will decide to engage in further quantitative easing, especially given the most recent economic weakness in the U.S., against the backdrop of the well-known problems in Europe and slower growth in China and other “emerging” economies. I shall turn to that in a few moments. First, I want to go back to the 12 Federal Reserve Banks.\n\n\n\nDifferent Growth Patterns in the 12 Federal Reserve Districts\n\nHere is a map of the 12 Federal Reserve Bank districts. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas is responsible for the Fed’s activity in the light green area—the Eleventh District—home to 27 million people in Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico. Roughly 96 percent of the district’s output comes from Texas.\n\n\n\nHere is a chart showing the disparate behavior of the economies in the 12 Federal Reserve Districts, as measured by employment growth. You will see that going back to 1990—some 22 years—the Eleventh Federal Reserve District has outperformed the other Federal Reserve Districts in job creation.\n\n\n\nIn terms of employment, the Dallas Fed’s district went into the recession last and was one of the first to come out. We have since punched through previous peak employment levels.\n\n\n\nHere is the job creation record of the so-called mega-states within the United States since 1990. And last, and just for fun, here is the record of Texas’ job creation over the past two decades versus resource-rich countries, such as Australia and Canada, as well as versus the major countries of Europe, the U.S. and Japan.\n\n\n\nIndulge me for a minute here. I share these with you not to engage in stereotypical “Texas brag” or because St. Andrews has become a popular destination for recent generations of undergraduate scholars from Texas. I do so to illustrate a point, specifically the influence of fiscal policy on the effectiveness of monetary policy.\n\nThe Limits of Monetary Policy and the Importance of Fiscal Policy\n\nHere is the rub. As mentioned, the FOMC sets monetary policy for the nation, for all 50 states—its influence is uniform across America. The same rate of interest is charged on bank loans to businesses and individuals in Texas as is charged New Yorkers or the good people of Illinois or Californians; Texans pay the same rates on mortgages and so on. Why is it that the Texas economy has radically outperformed the rest of the states? A cheap answer is to revert to the hackneyed argument that Texas has oil and gas. It is true that we produce as much oil as Norway and almost as much natural gas as Canada. And we have some 60 percent of the refineries of the United States. But remember that the numbers I showed you are employment numbers. Only 2 percent of employment in Texas is directly generated by oil and gas and mining and related services. We are grateful that we are energy rich. But we are a diversified economy not unlike the United States, where business and financial services, health care, travel and leisure activities and education account for similar portions of our workforce. Why, then, do we outperform the rest of the United States?\n\nTo me, the answer is obvious: We have state and local governments whose tax, spending and regulatory policies are oriented toward job creation. We have the same monetary policy as all the rest; our income is taxed at the same federal tax rate; and we are equally impacted by Washington’s tax, spending and regulatory policies. But we have better fiscal policy at the state level. We have no state income tax; we are a right-to-work state; we have state and local governments that, under both Democratic and Republican leadership, have for decades assiduously courted job creators—so much so that we have even outperformed the job creation of most every other major industrialized economy worldwide, as shown by the previous slide.\n\nWhither Monetary Policy?\n\nNow, back to the hue and cry of financial markets, and the question of further monetary accommodation. Interest rates are at record lows. Trillions of dollars are sitting on the sidelines, not being used for job creation. We know that in areas of the country where fiscal and regulatory policy incents businesses to expand—Texas is the most prominent of those places—easy money is more likely to be put to work than in places where government policy retards job creation. During the next few weeks as I contemplate the future course of monetary policy, I will be asking myself what good would it do to buy more mortgage-backed securities or more Treasuries when we have so much money sitting on the sidelines and yet have no sense of direction for the future of the federal government’s tax and spending policy. And with the president’s health care legislation awaiting resolution in the Supreme Court, we also know that no business can budget its personnel costs until that case is decided. If job-creating businesses have no idea what their taxes will be, are clueless about how federal spending will impact their customers or their own businesses and cannot budget personnel costs—all on top of concerns about the risk to final demand posed by the imbroglio in Europe and slowing growth in emerging-market countries—how could additional monetary policy be stimulative?\n\nA good theoretical macroeconomist can acknowledge that a great deal of liquidity is, indeed, going unused at present. They might likely argue that further monetary accommodation would raise inflationary expectations by magnifying the fear that the Fed and other monetary authorities are hell-bent on expanding their balance sheets and, consequently, the money supply so dramatically that inflation will inevitably follow. The result, the good macroeconomist would deduce, would be salutary: It would scare money out of businesses’ pockets and into job expansion and would lead individuals to conclude they better spend their money today rather than have it depreciated by inflation tomorrow, thus pumping up consumption and final demand.\n\nI beg to differ. I would argue that this would represent a form of piling on the already enormous uncertainty and angst that businesses face with our reckless fiscal policy. To me, that would be the road to perdition for the Federal Reserve. There is in the marketplace a lingering fear that the Fed has already expanded its balance sheet to its stretching point and that an exit strategy, though articulated, remains theoretical and untested in practice. And there is a growing sense that we are unwittingly, or worse, deliberately, monetizing the wayward ways of Congress. I believe that were we to go down the path to further accommodation at this juncture, we would not simply be pushing on a string but would be viewed as an accomplice to the mischief that has become synonymous with Washington.\n\nRaeburn versus Munch\n\nThere is no question that these are worrisome times: The world economy is slowing, joblessness is rampant in many countries, and in the United States, growth is anemic and unemployment remains unacceptably high. To me, this means that the Fed, and all central banks, must keep their heads about them and not give in to the convenient recommendations of those who are given to solving all problems with monetary policy.\n\nIf only for your visual pleasure, I have chosen two paintings anybody in the vicinity of St. Andrews and Edinburgh would know, in order to illustrate alternative approaches to central banking at this juncture.\n\nThe first is an icon of Scottish culture: Sir Henry Raeburn’s depiction of The Reverend Robert Walker Skating on Duddingston Loch, a seminal work in the permanent collection of the Scottish National Gallery and a favorite of mine since I first saw it some 30 years ago.\n\n\n\nTo me, Raeburn’s work provides a fitting visual metaphor for the ideal countenance of a central banker: The Reverend Walker skating forward confidently and with grace upon a notably uneven, rocky surface on an icy, dark, blustery day.\n\nAn alternative depiction is Edvard Munch’s The Scream from Norway’s Gunderson Collection, now on temporary exhibit at the National Gallery. (There are four versions of this pastel, one of which recently sold for $119.9 million at auction at Sotheby’s. If you haven’t been into Edinburgh to see the Gunderson version, I am sure you read about Sotheby’s record-setting auction.)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn sharp contrast to Raeburn’s painting of composure, The Scream depicts a panicked form. In an autobiographical epigraph, Munch wrote that he conceived of the painting after a period of exhaustion and despair: “I stopped and leaned against the balustrade, almost dead with fatigue. Above the blue-black fjord hung the clouds, red as blood and tongues of fire. My friends had left me, and alone, trembling with anguish, I became aware of the vast, infinite cry of nature.”[1]\n\n\n\nI am going to conclude by suggesting that the image that best behooves central bankers as guardians of financial stability and agents of economic potential is that of Henry Raeburn’s Reverend Walker. To be sure, central bankers everywhere are fatigued and exhausted and increasingly friendless. But when the landscape is dark and threatening, those charged with making monetary policy must comport themselves with a grace that reassures markets and the public that they are calmly in control of the sacred charge with which they have been entrusted. They must keep their “cool” even when the vast, infinite cry of the money changers reaches a fevered pitch, the economic seas are blue-black and the clouds in the financial markets are red as blood and tongues of fire. Presenting an image comparable to that of the visage depicted by Edvard Munch—of policymakers trembling with anguish at the daunting demands of their profession—would provide scant comfort to those who depend upon them to maintain their composure and skate ably across a cold and foreboding economic landscape, seeking to guide the economy to a better place.\n\nCentral banks are just one vehicle for influencing overall macroeconomic behavior, in addition to influencing through regulation the microeconomic agents that transmit that influence to the markets—banks of deposit and other financial institutions. We work alongside another potent macroeconomic lever: fiscal authorities—governments that have the power to tax the people’s money, spend it in ways they deem appropriate, and create laws and regulations that influence microeconomic behavior.\n\nUnless fiscal authorities can structure their affairs to incent the private sector into putting the cheap and ample money the Fed has provided to the economy to work in job creation, monetary policy will prove impotent. And we will likely barely survive our first centennial, let alone have confidence that we will reach our sixth.\n\nThank you.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "May 11, 2012 Fort Worth, Texas\n\nIn many of my recent speeches, I have noted that the Texas economy is outperforming the nation. Here are three slides I have used to illustrate the point: We were the first large state to punch through prerecession peak employment levels; we have led the nation and the other “power” states in job growth over the past 21 years; we have even outperformed the resource-rich countries of Australia and Canada, and core European countries, England and Japan—the so-called advanced economies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, I was on a panel titled “Jobs for America” at the Milken Institute’s 2012 Global Conference in Los Angeles with John Engler, the former governor of Michigan, who now runs the Business Roundtable.[1] Unprompted by me, the governor led off the discussion by saying that his home state of Michigan and his host state of California—indeed, the whole country—need to become more like Texas. I thanked him, and with prototypical Texas humility, suggested that we were simply rewriting the words to George Strait’s song, “All My Exes Live in Texas.”[2] It’s not just ex-wives, but ex-businesses, ex-employers, ex-taxpayers and ex-voters of Michigan and California (and New York and other areas of the country) who are pulling up stakes and coming to live a new life and thrive in Texas.\n\n\n\nJust as we have outpaced others in job creation, our banking industry has outperformed the nation. For example, last year, Texas-based banks earned a return on assets (ROA) of 1.1 percent; banks nationwide earned an ROA of 0.9 percent.\n\nThis is a pretty good performance, considering what the industry recently went through. But what’s most notable is that this marks the fifth consecutive year that Texas banks have done better than their counterparts nationwide in terms of profitability. In fact, at the height of the crisis, in 2009, Texas banks earned a profit of $1.4 billion while the entire U.S. banking industry lost $11.5 billion.\n\n\n\nThese slides tell the Texas banking story in high definition—you all are the pride of the nation’s banking community.\n\nMost of you remember the legendary Bob Hankins, who recently retired after 20 years as head of supervision at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Bob had a saying that Texas banks were “twice as good and half as bad” as banks nationwide. That remains the case, though banks around the U.S. are slowly catching up with Texas. For example, in Texas last year, the noncurrent loan rate was down to 2.4 percent (from 3.1 percent in 2010). At banks across the U.S., the noncurrent loan rate was 4.1 percent (from 4.9 percent in 2010). Charge-offs were 0.7 percent of all loans in Texas in 2011, compared with 1.6 percent nationwide.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe the best summary of what’s going on with Texas banks when compared with the rest of the nation can be found in the so-called Texas ratio. Those of us of a certain age will remember the Texas ratio, which is technically defined as noncurrent loans plus OREO (other real estate owned) expressed as a percentage of tangible equity capital plus loan loss reserves.[3] Given that definition, no banker of any distinction would want the Texas ratio to exceed 100 percent.\n\n\n\nWe earned that moniker in the late 1980s when 20 percent of our banks had a Texas ratio exceeding 100 percent. However, in 2011 only 0.9 percent of Texas banks had a Texas ratio greater than 100 percent, compared with 4.6 percent nationwide—and that nationwide number is down from a 5.7 percent peak in 2010. That’s why, for the past 10 years or so, old Bob Hankins insisted on calling it the “anywhere-but-Texas ratio” and suggested it be replaced, perhaps, by the “Georgia ratio.” Last year, 24 percent of banks based in Georgia recorded a Texas ratio greater than 100 percent. And the peak in Georgia was even worse than the peak in Texas in the 1980s. In 2010, a remarkable 32 percent of Georgia banks recorded a Texas ratio exceeding 100 percent.\n\nWhile we pray for our banking brethren in Georgia and other areas of the country, let’s remember to say grace over what we have here at home. Texas is home to the nation’s best-run banks. And the best-performing economy in the country.\n\nIn his classic tome, Lone Star: A History of Texas and the Texans, historian T.R. Fehrenbach wrote: “The Texan ethic and Texas society rewarded enterprise … work was the real virtue. We chose this land; we took it; we made it bear fruit.” We are a people for whom “the cult of courage was obvious.”[4] This remains the case for the working men and women of this great state and for its business operators and bankers. It is why we thrive when others wither. It is why even a Michigan governor sings our praises. I am counting on the Texas Bankers Association to keep it that way.\n\nGood luck and Godspeed.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "March 5, 2012 Dallas, Texas\n\nI have been asked to speak about the economy. I am going to take a different approach than is typical for a Federal Reserve speech. I’ll eschew making the prototypical forecast, except to note that from my perch at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, I presently see that: a.) On balance, the data indicate improving growth and prospects for job creation in 2012. However, the outlook is hardly “robust” and remains constrained by the fiscal and regulatory misfeasance of Congress and the executive branch and is subject to a now well-known, and likely well-discounted, list of possible exogenous shocks—the so-called “tail risks”—posed by possible developments of different sorts in the Middle East, Europe, China and elsewhere. And b.) While price stability is being challenged by the recent run-up in gasoline prices—which has yet to be reflected in the personal consumption expenditure and consumer price indexes but may well make for worrisome headlines when February data are released—the underlying trend has been converging toward the 2 percent long-term goal formally adopted by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) at its last meeting.[1]\n\nAs to the outlook envisioned by the entire FOMC, you might wish to consult the forecasts of all 17 members, which include those of yours truly, that were made public after the January meeting—though I think a puckish footnote appended to the internal document laying out a component of the December 1966 FOMC forecast might still apply: “Not to be used externally, but also harmful if swallowed.”[2]\n\nSpeaking of harmful if swallowed, I might add that I am personally perplexed by the continued preoccupation, bordering upon fetish, that Wall Street exhibits regarding the potential for further monetary accommodation—the so-called QE3, or third round of quantitative easing. The Federal Reserve has over $1.6 trillion of U.S. Treasury securities and almost $848 billion in mortgage-backed securities on its balance sheet. When we purchased those securities, we injected money into the system. Most of that money and more has accumulated on the sidelines: More than $1.5 trillion in excess reserves sit on deposit at the 12 Federal Reserve banks, including the Dallas Fed, for which we pay private banks a measly 25 basis points in interest. A copious amount is being harbored by nondepository financial institutions, and another $2 trillion is sitting in the cash coffers of nonfinancial businesses.\n\nTrillions of dollars are lying fallow, not being employed in the real economy. Yet financial market operators keep looking and hoping for more. Why? I think it may be because they have become hooked on the monetary morphine we provided when we performed massive reconstructive surgery, rescuing the economy from the Financial Panic of 2008–09, and then kept the medication in the financial bloodstream to ensure recovery. I personally see no need to administer additional doses unless the patient goes into postoperative decline. I would suggest to you that, if the data continue to improve, however gradually, the markets should begin preparing themselves for the good Dr. Fed to wean them from their dependency rather than administer further dosage.\n\nI am well aware of the salutary effect of accommodative monetary policy on the equity and fixed-income markets—remember, I am the only member of the FOMC who used to be on the other side. My firms’ record of substantially outperforming the equity and fixed-income indexes over a prolonged period before I hung up my investment business and entered public service in 1997 was achieved by focusing on the long-term fundamentals of the real economy and the underlying value of the securities we purchased or sold—not by depending on central bank largesse. Counting on the Fed to perpetually float returns is a mug’s game.\n\nFrom my present perspective on the side of the angels, as a member of the policymaking team on the FOMC, I believe adding to the accommodative doses we have applied rather than beginning to wean the patient might be the equivalent of medical malpractice. Having never before pursued this course of healing, we run the risk of painting ourselves further into a corner from which we do not know the costs of exiting. It is my opinion that we should run that risk only in the most dire of circumstances, and I presently do not see those circumstances obtaining.\n\nSo much for forecasting and monetary policy. Let me now walk you through an overview of the Texas economy to set the stage for a broader discussion of what I believe continues to bedevil a lasting recovery and more efficient job creation in the United States.\n\nI will use some slides to illustrate key points.\n\n\n\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research, the arbiter of when recessions begin and end, dates the onset of the Great Recession as December 2007. The economic performance of Texas since December 2007 can be summarized with the chart projected on the screen. It depicts employment growth in the 12 Federal Reserve districts. In the Eleventh Federal Reserve District—or the Dallas Fed’s district—96 percent of economic production comes from the 25.7 million people of Texas. As you can see by the red line, we now have more people at work than we had before we felt the effects of the Great Recession. All told in 2011, Texas alone created 212,000 jobs.[3]\n\nOnly two other states can claim they surpassed previous peak employment levels: Alaska and North Dakota.\n\nReaders of this speech abroad—say, in Washington or New York—might think our growth last year came only from the burgeoning oil and gas patch. They would be right to describe it as burgeoning: 30,000 jobs were added in oil and gas and the related support sector last year. Texas now produces 2.1 million barrels of oil per day, the same amount as Norway; we produce 6.7 trillion cubic feet of natural gas a year, only slightly less than Canada.[4]\n\nWith 25 percent of U.S. refinery capacity and 60 percent of the nation’s petrochemical production located in Texas, we most definitely benefit from both upstream and downstream energy production.\n\nAnd yet other sectors gained more jobs than the oil and gas sector and its support functions in 2011: 58,000 jobs were added in professional and business services, nearly 46,000 in education and health services and more than 41,000 in leisure and hospitality. Manufacturing—which accounts for approximately 8 percent of total Texas employment—added over 27,000 jobs.\n\nAll told, the private sector in Texas expanded by 266,400 jobs in 2011, while the public sector contracted by 54,800, due primarily to layoffs of schoolteachers. In sum, Texas payrolls grew 2 percent, significantly above the national rate of 1.3 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis performance is not unique to last year. As you can see from this graph of nonagricultural employment growth by Federal Reserve district going back to January 1990, the Eleventh District has outperformed the nation on the job front for over two decades. Note the slope of the top line, which depicts job growth in the Eleventh District compared with each of the other districts and, importantly, relative to employment growth for the U.S. as a whole—denoted by the black line, the seventh one down.\n\nAs was pointed out in high relief by the media when a certain Texas governor was briefly in the hunt for his party’s presidential nomination, we do have some serious deficiencies in the Lone Star State. We have a very large number of people earning minimum wage; we have an unemployment rate that, while trending downward, is still too high, abetted by continued inflows of job seekers from less-promising sections of the country. But I’ll bet you that those who constantly enumerate our deficiencies and are given to habitual Texas-bashing would give their right—or should I say, left—arms to have Texas’ record of robust long-term job creation instead of the anemic employment growth of other megastates such as California and New York. Or even the job formation record of many other countries! The following chart shows that over the past two decades, the rate of employment growth in Texas has exceeded that of the euro zone and its two anchors, Germany and France, as well as that of two natural-resource-intensive countries with populations comparable to Texas’, Canada and Australia.\n\nNow, is all this just prototypical Texas brag, or are there lessons the nation can learn from the success that is enjoyed here? Texans are hardly given to modesty, but I believe there are some undeniable lessons being imparted here.\n\nOne lesson I draw from comparative state data is that monetary policy is a necessary but insufficient tonic for economic recovery. The Fed has made money cheap and abundant for the entire country. The citizens of Texas and the Eleventh Federal Reserve District operate under the same monetary policy as do our fellow Americans. We have the same mortgage rates and pay the same rates of interest on commercial and consumer loans, and our businesses borrow at the same interest rates as their brethren elsewhere in the country. Which raises an important question: If monetary policy is the same here as everywhere else in the United States, why does Texas outperform the other states?\n\nThe answer is no doubt complicated by the fact that Texas is blessed with a comparatively great amount of nature’s gifts, a high concentration of military installations and what some claim are other “unfair” advantages.\n\nBut many of these “unfair” advantages are man-made: They derive from a deliberate approach by state and local authorities to enact business-friendly regulations and fiscal policy. For example, if you examine the differences between Texas and two states that have been underperforming for a prolonged period—California and New York—you will note that these former power states have less-flexible labor rules. Due to local taxes, differences in zoning practices and myriad other factors, the cost of housing and the overall cost of living in California and New York are significantly higher than they are here. And due to differences in policies governing education, the scores measuring middle-school students’ proficiency in math are lower in both California and New York than they are in Texas, and in reading, are lower in California and only slightly higher in New York.[5]\n\nTaken together, these factors, alongside whatever natural advantages we may enjoy (though it is hard to compete with the physical beauty of California and the Great Lakes region or the cultural splendor of New York), affect where firms choose to locate and hire and where people choose to raise their families and seek jobs.\n\nI would argue that an additional factor favors Texas: We have a Legislature that under both Democratic and Republican governors has over time deliberately crafted laws and regulations, and tax and spending regimes, encouraging business formation and job creation.\n\nJust last month, Fairfield, Calif.-based vehicle reseller Copart Inc. announced that it will move its headquarters to Texas, citing “greater operational efficiencies.”[6] The CEO for the owner of Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. restaurants, Andy Puzder, claims it takes six months to two years to secure permits in California to build a new Carl’s Jr., whereas in Texas, it takes six weeks. These two anecdotes from California alone clearly illustrate that firms and jobs will go to where it is easiest to do business—not where it is less convenient and more costly.\n\nBoth state and federal authorities need to bear this in mind as they plot changes in the fiscal and regulatory policy needed to restore the job-creating engine of America. As an official of the Federal Reserve charged with making monetary policy for the country as a whole, I am constantly mindful that investment and job-creating capital is free to roam not only within the United States, but to any place on earth where it will earn the best risk-adjusted return. If other countries with stable governments offer more attractive tax and regulatory environments, capital that would otherwise go to creating jobs in the U.S.A. will migrate abroad, just as intra-U.S. investment is migrating to Texas.\n\nThus, even if one were to somehow have 100 percent certainty about the future course of Federal Reserve policy and be completely comfortable with it, without greater clarity about the future course of fiscal and regulatory policy and whether that policy will be competitive in a globalized world, job-creating investment in the U.S. will remain restrained and our great economic potential will remain unrealized.\n\nI pull no punches here: We have been thrown way off course by congresses populated by generations of Democrats and Republicans who failed the nation by not budgeting ways to cover the costs of their munificent spending with adequate revenue streams. The thrust of the political debate is now—and must continue to be—how to right the listing fiscal ship and put it back on a course that encourages job formation and gets the economy steaming again toward ever-greater prosperity. No amount of monetary accommodation can substitute for the need for responsible hands to take ahold of the fiscal helm. Indeed, if we at the Fed were to abandon our wits and seek to do so by inflating away the debts and unfunded liabilities of Congress, we would only become accomplices to scuttling the economy.\n\nI was in Mexico last week. Mexico has many problems, not the least of which is declining oil production, low school graduation rates and drug-induced violence. But on the fiscal front, the country is outperforming the United States. Mexico’s government has developed and implemented better macroeconomic policy than has the U.S. government.\n\nMexico’s economy contracted sharply during the global downturn, with real gross domestic product (GDP) plummeting 6.2 percent in 2009. But growth roared back, up 5.5 percent in 2010 and 3.9 percent in 2011, with output reaching its prerecession peak after 12 quarters—three quarters sooner than in the U.S. Mexico’s industrial production passed its prerecession peak at the end of 2010; ours has yet to do so.\n\nNow hold on to your seats: Mexico actually has a federal budget! We haven’t had one for almost three years. Furthermore, the Mexican Congress has imposed a balanced-budget rule and the discipline to go with it, so that even with the deviation from balance allowed under emergencies, Mexico ran a budget deficit of only 2.5 percent in 2011, compared with 8.7 percent in the U.S. Mexico’s national debt totals 27 percent of GDP; in the U.S., the debt-to-GDP ratio computed on a comparable basis was 99 percent in 2011 and is projected to be 106 percent in 2012. Imagine that: The country that many Americans look down upon and consider “undeveloped” is now more fiscally responsible and is growing faster than the United States. What does that say about the fiscal rectitude of the U.S. Congress?\n\nHere is the point: As demonstrated by the relative and continued, inexorable outperformance by Texas—which is affected by the same monetary policy as are all of the other 49 states—the key to harnessing the monetary accommodation provided by the Fed lies in the hands of our fiscal and regulatory authorities, the Congress working with the executive branch. As demonstrated by the fiscal posture of Mexico, a nation can effect budgetary discipline and still have growth.\n\nOne might draw two lessons here.\n\nThe first comes from Germany’s finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, who from my perspective was spot on when he said, “If you want more private demand, you have to take people’s angst away” by having responsible and disciplined fiscal and regulatory policy.[7] Clearly, there is less angst involved in conducting business in Texas.\n\nThe second is a broader, macroeconomic truism: that fiscal and regulatory policy either complements monetary policy or retards its utility as a propellant for job creation. Mexico is proof positive that good fiscal policy enhances the effectiveness of thoughtfully conducted monetary policy, which is what the Banco de México—whose independence, incidentally, was enshrined by a constitutional amendment in 1994—has delivered under its single mandate of inflation control and by applying the tool of inflation targeting.\n\nI should be injecting some levity into the event, though it is hard to do so when one talks about our feckless fiscal authorities. But there are witty people who have found a way to do so. Take a look at this parody of Congress that my staff found on YouTube: www.youtube.com/watch?v=Li0no7O9zmE.\n\nThere you have the prevailing modus operandi of our fiscal authorities: pass the bill rather than the American dream to our children. What a sad tale!\n\nYou asked me to talk about the economy. In a nutshell, my answer is this: Monetary policy provides the fuel for the economic engine that is the United States. We have filled the gas tank and then some. And yet businesses will not use that fuel to a degree necessary to realize our job-creating potential and create a better world for the successor generation of Americans until Congress, working with the executive branch, does the responsible thing and pulls together a tax, spending and regulatory program that will induce businesses to step on the accelerator and engage the transmission mechanism of job creation so they and the consumers they create through employment can drive our economy forward.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "February 29, 2012 Mexico City\n\nThank you, Luis [Téllez], for that kind introduction. Luis and I have been good friends for many years, and I delight in our friendship.\n\nI am in Mexico fostering the close relationship and tradition of consultation and exchange that the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas has enjoyed over the years with the Banco de México. In this regard, I am especially grateful to Governor Agustín Carstens for his hospitality this week. Agustín spent some time at the Dallas Fed when he was a young man, and we take pride in this being a small part of his accomplished career. For many years, the Dallas Fed’s El Paso Branch has held joint board meetings and informational exchanges with the regional offices of the Banco de México. Our economists have worked with their counterparts at the Banco to share expertise on regional economic indicators, such as the construction of state coincident indexes. And Governor Carstens’ predecessor, Guillermo Ortiz, is an Advisory Board member of the Dallas Fed’s Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute. So it is fair to say that the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and the Banco de México enjoy a unique and mutually beneficial relationship. That relationship has been enriched by the last few days’ exchange between my team and Agustín’s.\n\nAs Luis and Agustín well know, there is a personal dimension to the Dallas Fed’s relationship with the Banco de México. I grew up here in Mexico City in the 1950s and attended an elementary school not far from this very spot. Spanish was my first language in school; to this day, I have many friends in El Norte who say I speak better Spanish than I do English. But I always correct their assertion by saying, “No, no hablo Español; hablo puro Mexicano!” So this morning, I will do my level best to speak to you in “Español Mexicano” rather than in “Ingles Texano.”\n\nA Bit of Nostalgia\n\nIn the 1950s, Mexico City was an ideal place to grow up. The city was safe; the skies were clear; Cantinflas inspired laughter for every moviegoer and Marcelino Pan y Vino, wonderment and tears. The Mexican economy was averaging GDP growth rates over 6 percent a year, and the population was growing over 3 percent per year. It seemed a golden era. The only fear I can recall as a child was of the stern teachers at school who would take a ruler to my knuckles or the palms of my hands at the slightest infraction.\n\nBack then, you could transit the entire length of “Avenida Reforma” in a taxi for one peso, unless you took the cheaper option preferred by my older brothers—Bob and Mike—of riding a bicycle alongside a speeding bus or truck, latching on to it with one hand and having it tow you along, at breakneck speed. Then, a kilo of black beans cost one peso; a liter of gasoline, 30 centavos. Today, you pay 25 pesos for a kilo of beans and 10 pesos for a liter of gas. Noting this, I suggested to my staff that either I am getting old or there has been a great deal of inflation in the interim. They responded that I was correct on both fronts!\n\nTurbulence and Lessons Learned\n\nMexico was in good shape when my family left in 1959 and would continue to do well for many more years, until the turbulent 1970s.\n\nBetween 1975 and 2000, there was one crisis after another: in 1976, 1982, 1985–88 and 1994. Most of those crises corresponded with national elections; presidential sexenios (six-year terms) were routinely welcomed with peso devaluations of 40 percent or more. The peso became the symptom of the diseased and dysfunctional macroeconomy.\n\nIn 1982, Mexico defaulted on its external debt, resulting in capital flight, continuing devaluations and soaring inflation. Each crisis resulted in a package of promised reforms, but they all ended in failure—except one. In 1986, Mexico joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT—now the World Trade Organization, or WTO). Reform efforts then accelerated under President Salinas, who took office in 1988. Privatization of public firms and industry deregulation picked up pace, and banking reforms were enacted. Notwithstanding, this era would also end with a crisis—the Tequila Crisis. But now, with the benefit of hindsight, we know that the foundations then being laid—and built upon by President Zedillo’s and subsequent administrations—would transform Mexico’s macroeconomic structures in a most impressive way.\n\nIn 1993, after decades of double-digit inflation, the old peso had to be replaced with a younger model with three fewer zeros. The new peso was slimmer and trimmer, but it soon suffered the same fate as the old peso. After all, it wasn’t the peso that was the problem. The problem was that Mexico had a central bank that was held captive by the fiscal authorities. Mexico was impoverished by the central bank’s complicity with the government’s fiscal mismanagement.\n\nWithout an independent central bank, there arose the age-old problem—the monetization of the government’s debt, or, in plain language, running the printing press to pay the bills. Monetization of fiscal profligacy struck Mexicans hard. Annual inflation averaged 15 percent in the 1970s and 70 percent in the 1980s, before descending to a still punishing level of 20 percent in the 1990s. Living standards stagnated as growth in real GDP per capita slowed to just 0.7 percent per annum between 1981 and 2000. These were, as others have noted, lost decades.\n\nThat Was Then. This Is Now: Time to Update Perceptions\n\nAs a result of these past crises, some people have negative perceptions of Mexico. And negative stereotypes take a long time to change. I believe it is time to change our perspective on Mexico. Reforms have been instituted and codified in your constitution that, on both the fiscal and monetary front, place Mexico on an exemplary plane. Not only is Mexico doing better, macroeconomically speaking, than the false stereotypes would have us think, Mexico is actually doing better than the United States in many macroeconomic areas.\n\nThis may come as a shock to those Americans who tend to look at Mexico solely through the lens of immigration or drug trafficking, or whose most benign perception of Mexico is gleaned from lying on a beautiful beach sipping a margarita in Punta Mita. As I will note in a moment, Mexico is macroeconomically sound and is moving in the right direction to address the vexing microeconomic problems that still hold your country back. In the United States, the opposite is the case. From a macroeconomic standpoint, Mexico’s future is bright; its prospects keep improving. Sadly, one cannot say the same about the present macroeconomic trajectory of El Norte.\n\nLos Tejanos Comprenden\n\nBefore proceeding, I might mention that Texans have a great deal of empathy for Mexico, not just because we share a common border and a unique, shared history. Or because Hispanics are 35 percent of our labor force and they and their families have energized our economy and enriched our culture. It is because Texas also suffers from outdated stereotypes despite our macroeconomic record. For over two decades, Texas has grown about twice as fast as the rest of the United States, with job growth averaging 2 percent per year, while nominal GDP per capita has caught up with and surpassed that of the nation. Indeed, Texas not only has led the nation in employment growth since 1990, but also has outpaced many of the “advanced” countries—ranging from Germany, France and the United Kingdom to Australia and Canada.\n\nYet more often than not (and especially during the brief period when a certain Texas governor aspired to be president), many who cling to old stereotypes depict Texas in terms befitting a dysfunctional state. The truth about Texas belies that fiction, just as it does with Mexico.\n\nThe Facts About Mexico\n\nSo what is the truth about the Mexican economy? We might start by examining some comparative metrics between Mexico and the United States.\n\nFor example, it is noteworthy that Mexico has recovered more rapidly from the Great Recession and the global financial crisis. To be sure, Mexico’s real output contracted sharply and deeply with GDP plummeting 6.2 percent in 2009. But real GDP roared back, growing 5.5 percent in 2010 and then 3.9 percent in 2011, and reaching its prerecession peak after 12 quarters. It took the U.S. 15 quarters, or almost an additional year, before GDP was back to its prerecession level.\n\nU.S. industrial production is still not back to prerecession levels, but Mexico’s industrial production passed its prerecession peak at the end of 2010.\n\nFiscal Policy\n\nOn the fiscal front, it might surprise fiscal authorities in El Norte that Mexico actually has a federal budget! And it might surprise you to know that the U.S. government has not agreed on a budget for three years running.[1] Furthermore, Mexico ran a budget deficit of 2.5 percent in 2011, compared with the U.S. figure of 8.7 percent. Mexico’s national debt is small, at 27 percent of GDP; in 2011, the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio was 99 percent and is projected to be 106 percent in 2012 as the national debt passes $16 trillion.[2]\n\nMexico has a tool that forces the government to hew to fiscal discipline. Since 2006, you have had a balanced budget rule, passed into law by your Congress. Deviations are only allowed in emergencies. Thus, even with the emergency situation that triggered a deviation from balance during the Great Recession and global financial crisis, Mexico’s budget deficit as a percentage of GDP was less than one-quarter that of the United States.\n\nThis is a fact: Your government has implemented greater fiscal discipline than mine and has done so in a way that has not hampered economic recovery.\n\nI started this speech mentioning Cantinflas. He was the master of the chiste—the joke, be it a sight gag or a funny line, often directed at the government. The Mexican government’s fiscal reforms have been anything but jokes; they have been serious reforms with a significant impact. In contrast, American politicians and policymakers have proven incapable of fiscal reform. U.S. fiscal authorities have not gotten their act together to figure out how to construct and implement a budget that restores confidence by reeling in the nation’s long-term deficits and unfunded liabilities while encouraging investment, job creation and risk taking. The Congress of the United States, and those who aspire to the presidency in 2012, might well benefit by broadening their perspective on Mexico from focusing solely on illegal immigration and drug and gun trafficking—important as those issues are—and take a chapter from Mexico’s book about implementing real fiscal reform.\n\nMonetary Matters\n\nTurning to monetary matters, it must be noted that the peso has been volatile in recent years, responsive to market forces acting on a currency which now freely floats. Before the financial crisis, it averaged about 11 pesos to the dollar; since 2009, it has averaged about 13 pesos to the dollar. Last year, it depreciated by 15 percent from July to December alone, but has since appreciated slightly against the dollar. What is striking, however, is that the pass-through of the peso’s weakness into inflation has been muted and temporary. Inflation was 3.6 percent in 2009, rose to 4.4 percent in 2010 then retreated to 3.8 percent in 2011. This is within the bands of the Banco de México’s inflation target. By comparison, the pace of inflation realized in the United States last year was 3.0 percent, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n\nI attribute this muting of inflation to the reform that made the Banco de México an independent central bank in 1993 and to the adoption of explicit inflation targeting in 2001.\n\nPre-central bank independence, Mexico’s inflation averaged a 43 percent annual rate; post-independence, this fell to 11 percent; since inflation targeting was implemented, the average inflation rate has fallen further to 4.4 percent per year.\n\nIt is important to note that as experience and credibility are gathered in the exercise of inflation rate targeting, a central bank can influence inflation expectations. The Banco de México appears to have done this successfully. The inflation target has been ratcheted downward: It was 6.5 percent in 2001; now it is 3 percent.\n\nAs a result of these important changes, the peso is now a store of value and not shunned as the financial leper it once was. The central bank’s short- and long-run commitments to low inflation have, over time, led to the development of a peso-denominated bond market and falling interest rates on government debt.\n\nPrevious to 1995, the Mexican yield curve ran all the way out to … 27 days! Cetes were the only form of issuance. In 1995, the Mexican government began to progressively build a yield curve. That year it issued notes up to one year in maturity; in 2000, notes up to five years; in 2004, bonds up to 20 years; and in 2006, 30-year bonds. Interest rates have fallen on each successive issue. In January, Mexico issued $2 billion in peso denominated 10-year bonds, yielding 3.7 percent and a bid-to-coverage ratio of 2½ to 1. This was the lowest rate the government has obtained for this maturity for which there is now 247 billion Mexican pesos outstanding.\n\nAnother note on Mexico’s debt: the market indicator that measures Mexico’s country risk (CDS spreads) has remained at low levels and, as of October 2011, fell below that of France (finally, revenge on Maximiliano!).\n\nThe point is that with regard to both inflation and cost of debt, Mexico’s monetary policy reforms are beginning to pay off.[3]\n\nOn the monetary front, I believe it is fair to say that the United States compares more favorably than on the fiscal front. At the last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in January, the Federal Reserve formally adopted a long-term inflation target of 2 percent. Simultaneously, we stated that though we have a dual mandate, unlike the Banco de México, we could not provide a numerical target for employment because “nonmonetary” factors have as much or more influence on employment dynamics as does monetary policy. I personally consider this an important signal to our fiscal authorities that they cannot expect inflation to absolve them of their duty—the need to institute fiscal and regulatory reforms necessary to restore sustainable employment growth.\n\nThis Time It Wasn’t Mexico…\n\nI’ll bet that everyone in this room can recall Guillermo Ortiz’s quip in Davos in 2008: “This time it wasn’t us.” It wasn’t you in significant part because of your government’s investment in fiscal and monetary reform. These reforms have not been perfect. Much work remains to be done. But Mexico has come far.\n\nYou have gone laudably far with trade liberalization since joining GATT in 1986. You ratified the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994. Your government has since implemented at least 13 trade agreements with 45 nations that I am aware of and is currently negotiating additional trade agreements with South Korea and Brazil.\n\nTrade liberalization has benefited the Mexican people. Average tariffs fell from 27 percent in 1982 to 1.3 percent in 2001, benefiting Mexican consumers and manufacturers. And the volume and composition of Mexican trade has changed significantly. In 1980, trade as a percentage of GDP was only 17.5 percent; today exports and imports are equivalent to 62 percent of economic output. In 1980, oil accounted for 58 percent of Mexico’s exports; today it accounts for only 16 percent. Thanks to the evolution of Mexico’s world class manufacturing industry, some 80 percent of Mexico’s exports are now manufactured goods.\n\n… Yet There Is More to Do\n\nAs to the opening up of the domestic economy, some progress has been made but much remains to be done. I hope you will allow a friendly neighbor to point out some concerns.\n\nThe good news is that around 1,000 plus Mexican public companies were deregulated in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Yet deregulation has been a mixed success. Banking privatization resulted initially in a banking crisis and expensive bailout, though now the Mexican banking system is on firmer footing. Mexican banks proved resilient during the recent global financial crisis. The majority of Mexican banks have capital levels that allow them to fully comply with Basel III capital regulation. Telephone deregulation, on the other end of the spectrum, has not been a success. It has resulted in a telecom monopoly that to this day remains a significant structural impediment to Mexican economic development. In a recent report, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimates that lack of competition in the communication sector led to welfare losses of $129.2 billion from 2005 to 2009, a loss equivalent to 1.8 percent of Mexico GDP.[4]\n\nI also worry about the future ability of the Mexican government to fund itself in an era of declining oil production. As you know, oil revenues have accounted for 34 percent of public revenue, while crude oil production has declined 25 percent from its 2004 peak to new lows of just 2.5 million barrels a day. Meanwhile, without oil, taxes as a share of GDP are still among the lowest in Latin America, despite the current government’s bold efforts to increase tax revenue. New ways may have to be found to maintain the balanced budget your Congress demands and to do so without choking off economic growth.\n\nOne concern that I have about Mexico’s long-term growth prospects is that Mexico ranks second to last in the OECD in high school completion rates; only 45 percent of Mexican students who enroll in upper secondary school graduate. Meanwhile, fully one-quarter of all Mexicans aged 15 to 29 are neither in school nor in the labor force. When young people are not in school or at work, more often than not there exists a potential for social instability and criminal activity to ensue.\n\nIt breaks my heart that violence continues to plague this great nation. The majority of companies in your industrial heartland in Northern Mexico report they have been directly affected by organized crime. This is testing the resolve of would-be investors, and inducing some prominent Mexicans to move their families and their businesses to Texas and elsewhere up north. This is a brain and productivity drain Mexico can hardly afford.\n\nAll of this and more, such as the monopolistic practices in the communications sector, restrain Mexican progress and productivity that should ensue from the great macroeconomic strides that you have made.\n\nI do not wish to offend mis compadres Mexicanos by pointing to these problematic issues. I am simply making the point that macroeconomic reform is a necessary but insufficient condition for economic progress. The rule of law, making for practicable education and removing impediments to a fulsome deployment of human, physical and financial capital are necessary to make hard-won macroeconomic reforms result in the improved welfare of the Mexican nation.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile the work of improving the lot of the Mexican people is far from complete, it is time to discard old stereotypes of Mexico and give the fiscal and monetary authorities here credit where credit is due. To those who doubted Mexico’s ability to reform, to cast off the old and embrace the new, I would like to suggest that the performance of the Mexican economy during and since the recent financial crisis should be enough to allay their fears. Mexico’s rapid recovery in all dimensions of its macroeconomy and financial sector is proof positive that the gain from reform is worth the pain. I would go so far as to say there are lessons to be learned here, lessons for the U.S. and even lessons for Europe. Mexico’s achievements have come through both monetary and fiscal reforms. They have worked in concert to provide the blueprint for a stable, strong macroeconomy. For this, Mexicans should be proud. And other nations, including my own, should be inspired.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "February 15, 2012 San Marcos, Texas\n\nThank you, Lee [Graham] for that kind introduction.\n\nThis morning I would like to provide an overview of the Texas economy as we see it from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and then draw some inferences for the nation as a whole.\n\nIn a nutshell, Texas continues on a path it has been on for over two decades, outperforming the nation in economic growth and job expansion. We have fully recovered the jobs lost during the Great Recession and have punched through previous peak employment levels.\n\n\n\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research, the arbiter of when recessions begin and end, dates the onset of the Great Recession as December 2007. The economic performance of Texas since December 2007 can be summarized with the chart being projected on the screen. It depicts employment growth in the 12 Federal Reserve districts. In the Eleventh Federal Reserve District—or the Dallas Fed’s district–96 percent of the economic production comes from the 25.7 million people of Texas. As you can see by the red line, we now have more people at work than we had before we felt the effects of the Great Recession. All told, in 2011, Texas created 212,000 jobs.[1]\n\nOnly two other states can claim they surpassed previous peak employment levels: Alaska and North Dakota. I do not wish to denigrate the good people of Alaska and North Dakota, but note that their combined population roughly equals that of Travis County.\n\nReaders of this speech abroad—say, in Washington—might think our growth last year came only from the burgeoning oil and gas patch. They would be right to describe it as burgeoning: 30,000 jobs were added in the oil and gas and related support sector last year. And it is correct that with 25 percent of U.S. refinery capacity and 60 percent of the nation’s petrochemical production located in Texas, we benefit from both upstream and downstream energy production. But other sectors outperformed oil and gas in the number of jobs created in Texas in 2011: 58,000 jobs were added in the professional and business services areas, nearly 46,000 in education and health services, and over 41,000 in leisure and hospitality. Manufacturing—which accounts for approximately 8 percent of total Texas employment—added over 27,000 jobs. All told, the private sector in Texas expanded by 266,400 jobs in 2011, while the public sector contracted by 54,800 jobs, due primarily to layoffs of schoolteachers. In sum, Texas payrolls grew 2 percent, significantly above the national rate of 1.3 percent.\n\n\n\nThis performance is not unique to last year. As you can see from this second graph of nonagricultural employment growth by Federal Reserve district going back to January 1990, the Eleventh District has outperformed the nation on the job front for over two decades. Note the slope of the top line, which depicts job growth in the Eleventh District compared with all the rest and, importantly, relative to the employment growth rate for the U.S. as a whole–denoted by the black line, the seventh one down.\n\n\n\nAs was pointed out in high relief when a certain Texas governor was briefly in the hunt for his party’s nomination for the presidency, we do have some serious deficiencies in the Lone Star State: We have a very large number of people earning minimum wage; we have an unemployment rate that, while trending downward, is still too high—largely stemming from the fact that our population of workers, including those who are migrating from other states, is growing faster than our ability to create jobs—and many other drawbacks. But I’ll bet you that those who harp on our deficiencies and are given to habitual Texas-bashing would give their right—or should I say, left—arms to have Texas’ record of robust long-term job creation, instead of the anemic employment growth of other mega-states, such as California and New York. Or even compared to other countries! This is a fun chart that will titillate the real Texas chauvinists in the room. It shows that over the past two decades the rate of employment growth in Texas has exceeded that of the euro zone and its two anchors Germany and France, as well as the growth rate of two natural-resource-intensive countries with populations comparable to Texas, Canada and Australia.\n\nLooking forward, there is good reason to expect continued robust job growth in Texas. The budgetary constraints originally assumed for the state government have proven less severe than originally thought. Due to stronger-than-anticipated tax receipts, it is unlikely employment for schools and other state and local institutions will be cut back as sharply as it was last year. And the Dallas Fed’s Texas Business Outlook Surveys for January indicate that the prospect for job expansion looks promising.[2]\n\nTo track the state’s manufacturing industry—which accounts for about 10 percent of the nation’s manufacturing output—the Dallas Fed conducts the Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey (TMOS). International Strategy & Investment (ISI), a prominent source that tracks, among other things, the various indexes put out by the Federal Reserve, reports that since 2004, the Dallas Fed’s TMOS business activity index has the highest correlation of all Federal Reserve bank surveys with the Institute of Supply Management’s “PMI”—a leading national index of manufacturing activity and sentiment.[3] According to the latest Dallas Fed survey, expectations regarding future business conditions are at an almost 12-month high.\n\nWhile we have good reason to be proud of our manufacturing prowess, the main driver of the Texas economy is the service sector. It accounts for over 65 percent of private-sector output and employs more than 7 million Texans. To understand trends in the service sector, the Dallas Fed conducts the Texas Service Sector Outlook Survey. According to the most recent survey, the employment index in this survey also signaled an increase in employment levels and in hours worked.\n\nI should add that we are always looking for ways to improve the accuracy of these surveys. As such, if any of you would be interested in participating in our Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey, please contact me or my staff.\n\nIn summary, barring some unforeseeable shock, I would expect Texas to continue leading the nation in job creation.\n\nOur record of job growth and the fact that people and companies have been voting with their feet and relocating to Texas from other states illustrate what for some is an inconvenient truth. The citizens of Texas and the Eleventh Federal Reserve District operate under the same monetary policy as do the rest of our fellow Americans. We have the same mortgage rates, pay the same rates of interest on commercial and consumer loans, and our businesses borrow at the same interest rates as our brethren in the rest of the country. Which raises an important question: If monetary policy is the same here as everywhere else in the United States, why does Texas outperform the rest?\n\nThe answer is no doubt complicated by the fact that we are blessed with a comparatively great amount of nature’s gifts, a high concentration of military installations and other “unfair” advantages.\n\nFor example, if you examine the differences among New York and California and Texas, you will note that these former power states have less-flexible labor rules: We are a right-to-work state; they are not. They have higher population densities: The “Golden State” is 2.3 times as densely populated as Texas; the “Empire State” is four times more densely populated. The cost of housing and the cost of living in both states significantly exceed the cost of living here. Scores measuring the proficiency of middle school students in math are lower in both California and New York than they are in Texas, and in reading, are lower in California and only slightly higher in New York.[4]\n\nOur senior economist and policy advisor Keith Phillips argues that taken together, these are among the important factors affecting where firms choose to locate and hire; these factors also affect where people choose to raise their families and seek jobs.\n\nI would argue that an additional factor favors Texas: We have a Legislature that under both Democratic and Republican governors has over time crafted laws and regulations encouraging business expansion and job creation.\n\nConsider the example of Hardee’s Restaurants. Hardee’s CEO, Andy Puzder, claims it takes six months to two years to secure permits in California to build a new Carl’s Jr. eatery, whereas in Texas it takes six weeks. This is testimony to the fact that the Texas Legislature and local communities are mindful that, as Keith Phillips says, “Government regulations are like prescription drugs: They can improve the quality of life, but in administering them, one must be mindful of their dosage, side effects and interactions.” If the dosage of regulation has the effect of chasing employers away, it is clearly counterproductive to job creation and economic growth.\n\n\n\nThis is not to say that there is no role for prudent regulation. For example, in 1997, Texas lawmakers passed legislation liberalizing home equity lending but limiting homeowner borrowing to no more than 80 percent of their home’s equity. This was no doubt a significant factor in our avoiding the boom and bust of the housing sector, as seen in this chart of the relative performance of home prices since 2000, where Texas is again depicted in the smooth red line.\n\nAs a result, at present, we have a relatively low percentage of homes that are “underwater,” as shown by this bar chart. Our homeowners are, thus, less burdened with their housing predicament and better positioned as consumers. Indeed, by not allowing our people to use their legally protected homesteads as ATMs, our laws prevented housing from fueling the consumer spending booms and busts seen in the other U.S. states.\n\nI think it is fair to say that the Texas Legislature has conducted the state’s fiscal and regulatory affairs so as to maintain confidence in the future.\n\nOne might draw two lessons here.\n\nThe first is that Germany’s finance minister, Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble, is right when he says, “If you want more private demand, you have to take people’s angst away” by having responsible and disciplined fiscal and regulatory policy. Clearly there is less angst involved in conducting business in Texas.[5]\n\nThe second is a broader, macroeconomic truism: That fiscal and regulatory policy either complements monetary policy or retards its effectiveness as a propellant for job creation.\n\nI have noted that under the same monetary policy regime that equally affects all 50 states, Texas has managed to return more quickly to peak employment. I attribute this to several factors but underscore that prudent fiscal and regulatory policy has facilitated our recovery from the Great Recession and for at least two decades, under both Democratic and Republican governorships and legislatures, has helped make Texas a leader in job creation and economic growth.\n\nMonetary policy provides the fuel for the economic engine that is the United States: As the nation’s monetary authority, the Federal Reserve has made money abundant and cheap for Texans and all Americans. And yet, businesses will not use that abundant and cheap fuel to an optimal degree until they have a clear understanding of how taxes and regulatory and other cost factors will affect their operations going forward. In Texas, they have greater certainty than elsewhere that state and local laws and regulations will encourage investment, business formation and job creation, and this gives us an advantage over many other states. But it is only a marginal advantage, which while important, is insufficient for us to reach our full potential in creating jobs. Federal taxes, spending patterns and regulation weigh heavily on the confidence and capacity of businesses in Texas, as they do elsewhere in the U.S. Ultimately, the key to harnessing the monetary accommodation that has been provided by the Fed lies in the hands of our fiscal and regulatory authorities, the Congress working with the executive branch.\n\nNo business operating in Texas or anywhere else in America can properly budget future costs or plan for payroll expansion and capital investment until it knows what its federal taxes will be or how federal spending and regulatory patterns will affect it, its suppliers or its customers. And no one—business operator, worker or consumer—can plan for the long term with confidence until the federal government removes the angst that is associated with runaway deficits and unfunded liabilities that threaten to drown our economy in debt.\n\nIn a world driven by rapid technological change and globalization, job-creating capital will flow not only to countries that conduct sound monetary policy but to places with the most welcoming, competitive tax and regulatory systems. This was underscored in a recent Harvard Business School (HBS) survey authored by Jan Rivkin and Michael Porter, two widely admired scholars on national competitiveness and economic development. Their survey of HBS alumni found that the greatest impediments to investing in and creating jobs in the U.S. are the current tax code and regulatory burden and uncertainty, as well as lagging workforce skills. Absent changes on these fronts, the Rivkin/Porter study found that more than 70 percent of respondents expect U.S. competitiveness to decline over the next three years, and along with it, job-creating investment.[6]\n\nNo amount of monetary accommodation will change the pathology described by professors Rivkin and Porter. Indeed, excessive monetary accommodation might only add a further dosage of angst, fueling fears of future inflation. Two weeks ago, following the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), we formally announced that the Federal Reserve has committed to targeting a maximum rate of 2 percent inflation over time. We also announced that we could not be bound by a formal numeric target for employment because “non-monetary” factors determine employment levels, in addition to monetary policy. For me, the message was clear: If we are to heal the plight of the American worker, our fiscal authorities cannot count on the Federal Reserve to do the job only those authorities can do; they must get their act together, set aside their partisan and personal ambitions and act to right their listing fiscal and regulatory ship.\n\nMy staff has found a wonderful sketch on YouTube that mimics the action the fiscal authorities have taken thus far. Here it is: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Li0no7O9zmE.\n\nThat sketch says it all. Whereas before, we used to pass the American dream to our children, we now pass the buck.\n\nNow, it is true that businesses that have driven their cost structure to maximum efficiency are beginning again to hire workers with the help of cheap and widely available money made possible by the Fed; the national unemployment rate is beginning to ebb. But too many Americans remain out of work and for too long. We have miles to go before we sleep in the comfort of knowing that the American dream of ever-growing prosperity has been restored.\n\nI would submit that until the fiscal authorities—the Congress and the executive–stop their posturing and their bickering, job creators will sleep only fitfully until they know how decisions about fiscal policy and regulation—if and when they are made—will affect their operations and final demand for their products. And until a credible long-term plan is crafted to bring perpetual deficits and debt accumulation under control, they will be haunted by the nightmare that our elected leaders are simply passing the bill to our children and our children’s children. This is a predicament the Fed is powerless to change.\n\nOn that happy note, Mr. Graham, I end. Now, in the best tradition of central bankers, I will do my best to avoid answering any questions you might have.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "February 2, 2012 Austin, Texas\n\nThank you, Patti [Ohlendorf]. I am flattered that such a great group of Austinites has turned out tonight. I am especially pleased that Alejandro and Rosa Laura Junco are here.\n\n\n\nAlejandro is CEO of the print media company Grupo Reforma. He has earned a sterling reputation for journalistic independence in a part of the world where independence is a rare and sometimes dangerous thing. Columbia University, the University of Missouri and Michigan State University have honored him for his journalistic accomplishments, and the University of Texas at Austin has named him a Distinguished Alumnus.\n\nAlejandro’s company and its flagship paper in Mexico City take their name from La Reforma, a period of liberalizing reforms that transformed Mexico into a nation state in the mid-19th century, beginning with the overthrow of the man Texans know best and like least—Santa Anna—and ending with the ascension to power of a good general gone bad, Porfirio Diaz. As a child growing up in Mexico City, I was taught about La Reforma in school. To this day, I can probably tell you as much about Benito Juarez, journalist-turned-jurist-turned-president Jose Maria Iglesias and other Reformistas as I can about Houston or Lamar or Washington or Lincoln.[1] Alejandro and Rosa Laura, seeing you tonight has revived school-day memories of some 53 years ago! It is a delight and honor to be with you.\n\nI will do two things tonight. First, I will give you an update on the performance of the Texas economy and what lies ahead. Second, I will give you my personal view of what the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee—the FOMC—announced after our meeting last week. Then, time permitting, I will be happy to avoid answering any questions you might have.\n\n\n\nThe economic performance of Texas since December 2007—the beginning of the U.S. recession, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research—can be summarized with the chart being projected on the screen denoting employment growth in the 12 Federal Reserve districts. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and its branches in Houston, San Antonio and El Paso administer the business of the Eleventh District (depicted by the red line), which includes Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico; 96 percent of the economic production of my district comes from the 25.7 million people of Texas. In 2011, Texas created 211,600 jobs. We now have more people at work than we had before we felt the effects of the Great Recession in the United States. We have now surpassed our previous peak employment levels.\n\nOnly two other states can claim they surpassed previous peak employment levels: Alaska and North Dakota. I do not wish to denigrate the good people of Alaska and North Dakota, but note that their combined population roughly equals that of Travis County.\n\nReaders of this speech abroad—say, in New York—might think our growth last year came only from the burgeoning oil and gas patch. They would be right to describe it as burgeoning: 30,000 jobs were added in the oil and gas and related support sector last year, an increase of 15 percent. But other sectors outperformed oil and gas in the number of jobs created in Texas in 2011: 58,000 jobs were added in the professional and business services areas, nearly 46,000 in education and health services and over 41,000 in leisure and hospitality. All told, the private sector in Texas expanded by 266,400 jobs, while the public sector, driven primarily by fewer schoolteachers, contracted by 54,800 jobs. In sum, Texas payrolls grew 2 percent, significantly above the national rate of 1.3 percent.\n\n\n\nThis performance is not unique to last year. As you can see from this second graph of employment growth by Federal Reserve district going back to January 1990, the Eleventh District has outperformed the nation on the job front for over two decades. Note the slope of the top line, which depicts job growth in the Eleventh District compared with all the rest and, importantly, relative to the black line—the seventh one down—the employment growth rate for the country as a whole.\n\nHere is the point: Judging solely by the employment data, Texas went into recession seven months after the nation, in September 2008, and came out three months earlier, in December 2009.[2] We have now recovered fully from the Great Recession and are back on pace in leading the nation in job growth. Yes, we have a very large number of people earning minimum wage, a still-too-high unemployment rate of 7.8 percent and many other deficiencies, all of which were pointed out in high relief when a certain Texas governor was briefly in the hunt for his party’s nomination for the presidency. But I’ll bet you, those who love to point these things out and are given generally to Texas-bashing would give their right—or should I say, left—arms to have the record of job growth of the Eleventh Federal Reserve District that is documented by these charts. So good citizens of Austin and of Texas, you have much to be proud of.\n\nAs to projections, there is no reason to not expect continued job growth at the same pace in Texas. The budgetary constraints originally assumed for the state government have proven less severe than originally thought: Due to stronger-than-anticipated tax receipts, cutbacks in employment for schools and other state and local institutions may end up being less drastic. And if the Dallas Fed’s Texas Business Outlook Surveys for January, released this past Monday and Tuesday, are reviewed, job expansion looks promising and expectations regarding future business conditions are at the highest level in almost 12 months. Our most recent employment indexes in those surveys signaled an increase in both employment levels and in hours worked.[3] Thus, barring some unforeseeable shock, I would expect Texas to continue leading the nation in job creation.\n\nIncidentally, our record of job growth and the fact that people and companies have been voting with their feet and relocating to Texas from other states illustrate what for some is an inconvenient truth. The citizens of Texas and the Eleventh Federal Reserve District operate under the same monetary policy as do the rest of our fellow Americans. We have the same mortgage rates, pay the same rate of interest on commercial and consumer loans, and earn returns and borrow at the same interest rates as do our brethren in the rest of the country. Which raises an important question: If monetary policy is the same here as everywhere else in the United States, why does Texas outperform the rest?\n\nThe answer is no doubt complicated by the fact that we are blessed with a comparatively great amount of nature’s gifts, a high concentration of military installations and other “unfair” advantages. But one cannot avoid the conclusion that one of those “unfair” advantages is that we have a Legislature, based here in Austin, that under both Democrat and Republican governors has over time crafted laws and regulations that encourage business expansion and job creation. They have conducted the fiscal affairs of the state so as to maintain confidence in the future. One might draw two lessons here: first, that Germany’s finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, is right when he says, “If you want more private demand, you have to take people’s angst away” by having responsible and disciplined fiscal policy;[4] and second, that fiscal policy either complements monetary policy or retards its effectiveness as a propellant for job creation.\n\nHerein lies the tale of the recent long-term policy and strategy statement issued by the FOMC at the conclusion of its meetings last week.\n\nMany of you may have read that the FOMC did three things after its two-day meeting Tuesday and Wednesday a week ago.\n\nFirst, the committee issued the usual policy statement, stating that it “currently anticipates that economic conditions … are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.”[5]\n\nThere are presently 17 participants in FOMC meetings: the 12 Federal Reserve Bank presidents and the five current governors. Ten out of the 17 people get to vote in any given year, with the governors and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York always having a vote. I voted last year, and you may recall that together with Mr. [Charles] Plosser of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and Mr. [Narayana] Kocherlakota of the Minneapolis Fed, I resisted the notion of a need for a statement indicating that monetary accommodation be tied to a specific date, be it in mid-2013, late 2014 or any other. Instead, I feel that the key should be to calibrate monetary policy according to the state or condition of the economy.\n\nWhile most all of my colleagues value the state-contingent argument, at last week’s meeting the majority of this year’s voters felt that a combination of factors—including an expectation that “economic growth over coming quarters [will] be modest and … the unemployment rate will decline only gradually”; that the housing sector “remains depressed”; and that a “slowing in global growth” and other factors, combined with an anticipation “that over coming quarters, inflation will run at levels at or below those consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate”— warranted a need for the committee to indicate it would likely maintain a significantly accommodative monetary stance for another three years.\n\nSecond, the statement was accompanied by a first-ever release of the individual economic and interest-rate forecasts of all the policy meeting’s 17 participants. Mind you, these are not binding commitments. They are based on the assumption of “appropriate monetary policy” and are, despite the best of intentions, largely guesswork, especially looking out over a multiyear period.\n\nMy predecessor at the helm of the Dallas Fed, Bob McTeer, used to say, “The first rule of forecasting should be ‘don’t do it.’” The second rule, he would add is, “If you give a number, don’t give a date.” But given the assignment to venture a vision as to where the fed funds rate would be in each of the next three years and over “the longer run” to the nearest one-quarter of one percent, the 17 intrepid souls of the FOMC, including yours truly, did so. Only three envisioned that the fed funds rate might rise from current levels by year-end 2012; six saw it doing so by year-end 2013 and 11 by year-end 2014. Over the longer term, the 17 members envisioned a funds rate of between 3¾ and 4½ percent.\n\nBob McTeer’s admonishment clearly does not resonate with the FOMC. And yet I would caution, again, that at best, the economic forecasts and interest-rate projections of the FOMC are ultimately pure guesses. I have yet to find a single economist on this planet who consistently forecasts the economy accurately, let alone projects with any precision the interest rate on overnight funds one year out or far into the future. If you examine the record of the Blue Chip economists or even of our superb Federal Reserve staff, you will find confirmation of a paucity of reliable economic forecasts.\n\nI note that even publicly traded companies that wrestle with the relatively easy task of providing forward guidance on revenue and earnings find that exercise especially vexing; most won’t venture beyond forecasting the upcoming quarter—and that is after they already have a month’s worth of the quarter’s data in hand! In this morning's Financial Times, Charles Goodhart, professor emeritus at the London School of Economics and former member of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee, claims to have examined the record of three central banks that have most prominently engaged in the practice of providing multiyear rate forecasts. He concludes: “The record for central banks in New Zealand, Sweden and Norway is not encouraging. In the short run, over the next three months and to a lesser extent over the subsequent quarter, these central banks do have additional (inside) information about their own future actions. Beyond this, however, the extra informational content of those central bank forecasts is zero. Moreover, the market knows that central bankers have no superhuman forecasting ability and will tend to view the supposed longer-term forecasts as a version of jawboning, attempts to persuade the market to change its mind for immediate policy purposes. Again, there is little empirical evidence that the market responds to such jawboning, and why should it when the central bank is as ignorant of the longer-term future as they are?”[6]\n\nI don’t in any way consider my learned colleagues on the FOMC to be ignorant. But I draw upon my own experience in the corporate world and upon the insights offered by Goodhart to suggest that you simply take all this forward guidance and forecasting a year or more out with a big grain of salt, bearing in mind that the policy statements and forecasts issued by the FOMC are tactical judgments of the moment, made within a broader strategic context.\n\nWhich leads me to what I consider the third and most important announcement we made last week: the statement of our longer-range goals and strategy. For the first time, the entire 17-member committee stated that, given inflation over the longer term is primarily determined by monetary policy, we are able to specify that an inflation rate of 2 percent, as measured by the index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent with our mandate. At the same time, we stated that we cannot specify an exact goal for employment because “the maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market” and that “change over time and may not be directly measurable.”[7]\n\nIn the aviary of monetary policy makers, I am considered a “hawk.” I respect the fact that the Congress of the United States has given the Federal Reserve a dual mandate of conducting monetary policy so as to have full employment and simultaneously maintain stable prices. I believe monetary policy is the principal determinant of long-term price stability. But I have long maintained that monetary policy is but one gear in the complicated gearbox that drives job creation. Education and other structural aspects of our economy condition the nation’s job-creating capacity; fiscal and regulatory policy, in turn, condition both the structure and dynamics of employment. I was delighted that the full committee recognized this and made it part of its official credo.\n\nIn a world driven by rapid technological change and globalization, job-creating capital will flow not only to countries that conduct sound monetary policy but to places with the most welcoming, competitive tax and regulatory systems. This was underscored in a recent Harvard Business School (HBS) survey authored by Jan Rivkin and Michael Porter, two widely admired scholars on national competitiveness and economic development. Their survey of HBS alumni found that the greatest impediments to investing in and creating jobs in the U.S. are our current tax code and regulatory burden and uncertainty, as well as lagging workforce skills. Absent changes on these fronts, the Rivkin/Porter study found that more than 70 percent of respondents expect U.S. competitiveness to decline over the next three years, and along with it, job-creating investment.[8]\n\nThus for me, explicitly acknowledging that monetary policy’s impact on employment is transitory and uncertain is a cardinal event. It signals to the markets that there are limits to the ultimate job-stoking efficacy of Federal Reserve policy. To the extent that inflation is running below 2 percent, the Federal Reserve may have somewhat greater latitude to pursue accommodation. However, the past few years have demonstrated, yet again, that allowing inflation to rise by no means guarantees faster job growth. The message to our nation’s fiscal authorities is that they cannot expect monetary policy to substitute for the need to get their act together, stop their shameful politicking, get on with putting their fiscal and regulatory house in order and do so in a manner that encourages rather than continually undermines job creation and economic expansion.\n\nI noted how Texas has managed under the same monetary policy regime to more quickly return to peak employment than other states. I attributed this in significant part to prudent fiscal and regulatory policy, underscoring that this not only facilitates job and overall economic expansion in Texas, but is the underpinning of confidence. I would suggest that now is the time for prudent fiscal policy to be enacted by a Congress that on both sides of the aisle has for far too long, under both Republican and Democratic presidents, been shamefully negligent of its responsibility. Today marks the 1,009th day without an agreed-upon federal government budget. The Congress has found it easier to not agree on a budget than to go about correcting fiscal imbalances that drive the nation’s growing indebtedness. Our political leaders’ misfeasance exacerbates the “angst” that inhibits the confidence of consumers and job-creating businesses.\n\nMy staff has found a wonderful sketch on YouTube that might best illustrate the behavior of Congress. Here it is: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Li0no7O9zmE.\n\nThat sketch says it all. The Fed, the nation’s monetary authority, has clearly articulated its longer-run goal and policy strategy and has conducted itself with integrity by responding to the needs of the economy. In contrast, the fiscal authorities have conducted themselves with impunity: Their only long-term strategy is to pass the bill to our children and grandchildren.\n\nI would suggest that Reforma is urgently needed in the conduct of fiscal affairs in our nation’s capital.\n\nAnd I will leave you with this thought: The power to make that happen is in your hands. You and your fellow citizens across this great country are the ones who elect the people who tax you and decide where to spend your money; you ultimately direct the nation’s fiscal future.\n\nAnd you share in the blame for it being such a mess.\n\nAccepting the status quo means you are acquiescing to encumbering your children and your children’s children with mismanaged fiscal policy, crippling debt and a dismal economic future.\n\nLook to Alejandro Junco as an example. He has taken great risk with his person and his family’s treasure to take on the status quo. Like Alejandro did for journalism in Mexico, I hope you will step up to the plate, risk whatever personal benefits and comforts you derive from the current regime and use your talents and resources to force a course correction in the fiscal affairs of our nation. For only then can we be assured of a bright and prosperous economic future. And only then can monetary policy, properly conducted, perform with maximum efficiency and minimal risk to price stability to restore the great job-creation potential of America.\n\nThank you.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "December 16, 2011 Austin, Texas\n\nThank you, Bobby [Jenkins]. It is an honor to speak at the 2012 Economic Forecast Luncheon. I am a poor substitute for the last of my Federal Reserve brethren to appear before this chamber—Ben Bernanke. The chairman would have enjoyed congratulating the brave souls from four of our leading universities who ventured forth last year to make their winning forecasts, which you have celebrated here today.\n\nIt is noteworthy that even the winners of this year’s forecasting sweepstakes were not insignificantly off the mark of what actually occurred in the national economy, with the exception of Dr. Gardner’s and Dr. Gilligan’s spot-on forecast for the prime rate. We know from our experience on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) that forecasting the economy these days has become difficult. During the course of the year, we saw large shifts in the outlook for growth, inflation and unemployment, reflecting the obvious fact that we are in an unfamiliar and rapidly changing economic environment. My undergraduate economics professor, John Kenneth Galbraith, used to chide that “the only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable.” Even though they were not spot-on, today’s forecast winners make economists look respectable, and I thank them for it.\n\nI hesitate to single out any one winner but I am compelled to do so, as Tom Saving is the father of Jason Saving, one of our very able economists at the Dallas Fed. The sins of the father have been visited on the son! Happily, so has a great virtue. In a recent New York Times article, Greg Mankiw wrote, “A prerequisite for being a good economist is an ample dose of humility.”[1] Like father, like son—Saving Senior and Junior both share a sense of humility, which is why I respect both of them so much.\n\nThis has been a remarkable year. The great comedic writer P.G. Wodehouse pretty much summed it up when he wrote that “just when a (fellow) is feeling particularly braced with things in general ... Fate sneaks up behind him with a bit of lead piping.”[2]\n\nAt the beginning of this year, I felt pretty confident, if not exactly “braced,” that we were on the path to recovery, albeit I projected a slow, jerky one. My forecasting skills are certainly not on par with those honored here today. But I am on record for calling the bottom of the recession in an interview published in the Dallas Morning News on Aug. 26, 2009, some 15 months before the official arbiter of recessions and recoveries—the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)—did. NBER pegged the beginning of the recovery as occurring at the beginning of the third quarter of 2009.[3]\n\nAt the time, I stated that while the recession may be over, the recovery would be a “slow slog.” My colleague, Mark Wynne, director of the Dallas Fed’s Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute, is fond of citing the ceremony that honors Saint Willibrord, the Catholic Church’s patron saint of convulsions. Every year in Luxembourg, there is a Willibrord procession. Participants proceed in a shuffle, taking two steps forward, then one step back. One might say that we at the Dallas Fed envisioned a Willibrord-like recovery—one that would be halting and given to occasional reversal and convulsions. However, barring some exogenous shock, we forecast the recovery would proceed slowly, gaining momentum over time. This is indeed what has occurred, despite the doubters and skeptics, over the past two years.\n\nIn a nutshell, my vision has been as follows: In 2008, businesses were experiencing cost-push pressures. They discovered they could not price the goods and services they were selling aggressively enough to match rising production costs. Headline inflation for both June and July 2008 was scored at an annualized rate of 11 percent, as measured by the Consumer Price Index; the 12-month rate in July 2008 was 5.5 percent—the highest level since January 1991. Driven by fear that inflation was beginning to systematically take root, and aided by an acceleration in the ability to harness productivity-enhancing technology and more sophisticated exploitation of globalization, businesses began to focus in earnest on cost containment. They began this process with their largest cost center, labor. When the Panic of 2008–09 struck in late summer, they doubled down on their cost-control initiatives. Final demand imploded; pricing power vanished; the prospect of top-line growth evaporated. To preserve margins, cost-control management became even more aggressive, with the result that labor took it in the neck and unemployment skyrocketed.\n\nToday, over three years into this dynamic, businesses remain cautious about cost control and adding significantly to payrolls and job-creating domestic capex. This is despite being awash in liquidity. The Federal Reserve has flooded the markets with cheap, readily available money. The private sector, the wellspring of productive job creation, now has the financial means to grow employment. But it lacks the incentive to do so.\n\nIf anything, I feel that my colleagues on the FOMC have exceeded the amounts necessary to fuel the needs of job creators. I balked at pledging to hold rates low through mid-2013, and felt that “Operation Twist” would be of doubtful efficacy except in making some quick profits for those market players who bought on the (regrettably too well circulated) rumor and sold on the news of the FOMC announcement. Despite what the Wall Street Journal wrote under my picture in Wednesday’s edition, I did not “vote (twice) against FOMC moves to push down long-term rates for fear they would generate inflation.”[4] I am, and always will be, a “hawk” on the inflationary front. But I voted against those initiatives because I felt that under the circumstances, they would do little to encourage job formation.\n\nWithin the FOMC and in many public speeches, I have argued that based on anecdotal soundings from the businesses I survey, and applying the rigorous analysis we do at the Dallas Fed in calculating the Trimmed Mean for Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE), inflation would likely move toward the 2 percent range as the year wore on.[5] The Consumer Price Index (CPI) report issued this morning confirms that downward trend (so Tom Saving might wish to revise his forecast down from the 4.5 percent he predicted for 2011). Today’s CPI report appears to confirm our expectation. I expect that companies who pushed through prices rather aggressively in 2011 will likely effect rollbacks in 2012, mitigating the headline price pressures we experienced this year. I have argued as much at the FOMC table.\n\nMy reluctance to support greater monetary accommodation has been based on efficacy: With businesses’ cash flow—driven by record high profits and bonus depreciation—at an all-time high, both absolutely and as a percentage of GDP; with every survey, including those of small businesses, indicating that access to capital is widely available and attractively priced;[6] with balance sheets having been amply reconfigured; and with bankers and nondepository financial institutions sitting on copious amounts of excess liquidity, I have argued that further accommodation was unlikely to motivate the private sector to put people back to work. It might even prove counterproductive should it give rise to fears the Fed is so hidebound by academic theory as to be blind to the practical consequences of harboring an ever-expanding balance sheet. This inevitably raises concerns we are creating distortions in the fixed income markets that inhibit proper market functioning, or concerns that—despite our protestations to the contrary—we are given to monetizing the government’s debt, an impulse that ultimately destroys a central bank’s credibility.\n\nI have argued that other, nonmonetary factors are inhibiting the robust job creation we all seek.\n\nOne of the inhibiting factors is the palpable concern about the future of final demand. It has slowly begun to strengthen domestically, yet developments in Europe, a slowdown in growth in emerging economies such as China and Brazil, and concerns about financial trip wires that might be triggered, give rise to caution. On the foreign front, we are innocent bystanders: There is little we can do but pray that fiscal and monetary authorities abroad get it right. So far, their moves have been less than reassuring. The Chinese have not provided convincing proof that they will be able to contain the pricking of their real estate bubble or the shadow banking industry that enabled it. This has led some to posit that Chinese growth may slow beyond the consensus expectation of China watchers. And as for the Europeans, one might say in the spirit of the season that when analysts opened the present wrapped and re-bowed by Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy in Brussels last week, it included that dreaded little note saying “assembly required,” had at least one part, Britain, missing and others—Sweden, Hungary and the Czech Republic—that may not fit.\n\nOne of the Dallas Fed’s astute economists, John Duca, has lately adopted the mantra that “Main Street Heals While Kaiser Street Reels” (29 Kaiserstrasse is the European Central Bank’s address). Recent real side indicators and financial market movements indicate a striking dichotomy between improving economic indicators here at home and signs that financial markets and economies continue to sour on the other side of the Atlantic. Thus, just as we had come to see the light of an evolving domestic recovery, one senses Europe, and possibly the emerging economies, sneaking up behind us, Wodehousean-pipe in hand, poised to knock us off course.\n\nThe brows of economic forecasters and business operators begin to furrow when contemplating the international landscape. But the face of both the economist and businessman turn into something akin to Edvard Munch’s Scream when contemplating the frightful consequences of indecision and political mischief at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington.\n\nI maintain that no matter how much cash you have on your balance sheet, or how compliant your banker might be, or how cheap the cost of money, you will not commit substantial capital to expanding your payroll or investing significant amounts to expand plant and equipment until you know what it will cost you to run your business; until you know how much you will be taxed; until you know how federal spending will impact your customer base; until you know the cost of employee health insurance; until you are reassured that regulations that affect your business will be structured so as to incentivize rather than discourage expansion; until you have concrete assurance that the fiscal “fix” the nation so desperately needs will be crafted to stimulate the economy rather than depress it and incentivize job creation rather than discourage it; or until you are reassured that the sinkhole of unfunded liabilities like Medicare and Social Security that Republican- and Democrat-led congresses and presidents alike have dug will be repaired so that our successor generations of Americans will prosper rather than drown in dark, deep waters of debt.\n\nMy colleague Sarah Bloom Raskin—one of the newest Fed governors, and a woman possessed with a disarming ability to speak in non-quadratic-equation English—recently used the example of the common kitchen sink to illustrate a point. I am going to purloin her metaphor for my description of our present predicament. You give a dinner party. The guests leave and you are washing the dishes. When you are done, you notice the remnants of the party are clogging the sink: bits of food, coffee grinds, a hair or two and the like. You have two choices. You can reach down and scoop up the gunk, a distinctly unpleasant task. Or you can turn the water on full blast, washing the gunk down the drain, providing immediate relief from both the eyesore and the distasteful job of handling the mess. You look over your shoulder to make sure your kids aren’t looking, and, voilà, you turn the faucet on full blast, washing your immediate troubles away.\n\nFrom my standpoint, resorting to further monetary accommodation to clean out the sink, clogged by the flotsam and jetsam of a jolly, drunken fiscal and financial party that has gone on far too long, is the wrong path to follow. It may provide immediate relief but risks destroying the plumbing of the entire house. It is a pyrrhic solution that ultimately comes at a devastating cost. Better that the Congress and the president—the makers of fiscal policy and regulation—roll up their sleeves and get on with the yucky task of cleaning out the clogged drain.\n\nThe former prime minister of New Zealand, Mike Moore, has written a book titled Saving Globalization: Why Globalization and Democracy Offer the Best Hope for Progress, Peace and Development. He dedicates it “to honorable public servants, elected or otherwise” and adds a quote from Martin Luther King Jr. To remind them of their ultimate duty as leaders of democratic societies, King said:\n\n“Cowardice asks the question—is it safe? Expediency asks the question—is it politic? Vanity asks the question—is it popular? But conscience asks the question—is it right? … There comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe, nor politic, nor popular, but one must take it because it is right.”[7]\n\nThat time is now. Our nation’s economy is at risk. The Federal Reserve has done everything it can to reduce unemployment without forsaking our sacred commitment to maintaining price stability, or crossing over the monetary river Styx into full-blown debt monetization. I personally don’t care which party is in the White House or controls Congress. All I know is that the “honorable” members of Congress and presidents past, Republicans and Democrats alike, have conspired over time, however unwittingly, to drive fiscal policy into the ditch. They purchased their elections and reelections with popular programs so poorly funded that they now threaten the economic well-being of our children and our children’s children. Instead of passing the torch on to the successor generation of Americans, they have simply passed them the bill. This is the opposite of honorable.\n\nLike all of you here, I am sickened by our politicians’ tendency to kick the can down the road, even when it is starkly clear that doing so jeopardizes America’s well-being. Small wonder that some recent polls show only 9 percent of the American people view Congress favorably. (One senator posited that the 9 percent consisted of blood relatives and congressional staff!)\n\nBut this is the holiday season, and especially now, I am given to viewing the world through optimistic eyes. The Christmas spirit may be overwhelming my judgment, but I believe that the American people—from the mainstream to the Tea Party to the unemployed and disaffected who have taken to the streets—are in the process of forcing politicians to get their act together. There is a loud, distinct, clarion call for leadership—for the people we entrust to right the rules that determine our economic future, cast away cowardice, expediency and vanity, and get on with leading us out of our fiscal wilderness.\n\nAt this time of year, I always count my many blessings. My brother, Mike, is here today; he has finally seen the light and has moved to Texas after a long and successful career in institutional asset management in New York and California. I admire him for more than his professional accomplishments. We experienced some rough times when we were kids, and he always stepped into the breach, forgoing the pleasures of his teenage years by working tough jobs so he could pay the rent and put food on our family table when things were not going well for our father. Thanks to Mike, we survived those difficult times and went on to live the American dream.\n\nMy brother and I know how blessed we are that our parents chose to immigrate to this great country. They came here because there was no limit to upward mobility; they came to the United States because it was the land of milk and honey; because they knew that here, their children would live better lives than they lived; that there was no limit to what anybody with determination and the lucky break of being an American could accomplish. Mike and I have lived out our parents’ dream. There is no reason why any American child today should not have that same opportunity.\n\nIf the American dream is to survive, we will need to re-create a fiscal and regulatory environment that—in conjunction with the Fed conducting prudent monetary policy—will liberate the forces of entrepreneurial risk taking that have always been America’s hallmark, and that allowed successor generations to live far better lives than their parents ever thought possible. Only then will we get back to generating the jobs and the prosperity for all of our people, not just for financial sharpies. Only then will we restore faith in the prospect of upward mobility for all, not just the few. And only then, with the nation’s economy firmly back on a trajectory of promise and prosperity, will we feel “braced” with confidence that no force can dislodge by sneaking up behind us with a proverbial lead pipe.\n\nBobby, I thank you and this wonderful audience for your time. Now, in the best tradition of central banking, I would be happy to avoid answering any questions you might have.",

            "content": "November 15, 2011 New York City\n\nIt is bracing to be with bright, young students here at the Politics and Business Club of Columbia University. I understand I have a high bar today: I need to surmount the heights reached in the insightful lecture recently given your undergraduate students by Vinny Guadagnino from the show Jersey Shore. I’ll do my best.\n\nExecutive Summary\nToday, I will speak to the issue of depository institutions considered “too big to fail” and “systemically important.” I will argue that, just as health authorities in the United States are waging a campaign against the plague of obesity, banking regulators must do the same with regard to oversized banks that undermine the nation’s financial health and are a potential threat to economic stability. I shall speak of the difficulty of treating this pernicious problem in a culture held hostage by concerns for “contagion,” “systemic risk” and “unique solutions.” I will posit that preoccupation with these concerns leads to an ethic that coddles survival of the fattest rather than promoting survival of the fittest, to the detriment of social welfare and economic efficiency.[1] I will express my hope that, properly implemented, the capstone of financial oversight, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd–Frank), might assist in reining in the pernicious threat to financial stability that megabanks or “systemically important financial institutions”—the SIFIs—have become. But I will also express concern about the difficulty of doing so, concluding with a suggestion that perhaps the financial equivalent of irreversible lap-band or gastric bypass surgery is the only way to treat the pathology of financial obesity, contain the relentless expansion of these banks and downsize them to manageable proportions.\n\nThe Problem with SIFIs\nAspiring politicians in this audience do not have to be part of the Occupy Wall Street movement, or be advocates for the Tea Party, to recognize that government-assisted bailouts of reckless financial institutions are sociologically and politically offensive; they stand the concept of American social justice on its head. Business school students here will understand that bailouts of errant banks are questionable from the standpoint of the efficient workings of capitalism, for they run the risk of institutionalizing a practice that distorts the discipline of the marketplace and interferes with the transmission of monetary policy.\n\nTo this last point, my colleague and director of research at the Dallas Fed, Harvey Rosenblum, and I have written about how too-big-to-fail banks disrupt the transmission of policy initiatives. I refer you to the article we jointly authored for the Wall Street Journal in September 2009, titled “The Blob That Ate Monetary Policy.” Our thesis was that as their losses mounted, the too-big-to-fails, or SIFIs, were forced to cut back their lending and gummed up the nation’s capital markets in general. Thus, before the Dodd–Frank Act was even proposed, we wrote that “guarding against a resurgence of the omnivorous TBTF Blob [must] be among the goals of financial reform.”[2]\n\nIn previous speeches I have taken note of another dimension to the problem of sustaining behemoth financial institutions, and that is the cost of doing so. Andrew Haldane, executive director for financial stability and a member of the Financial Policy Committee at the Bank of England, provides some rough estimates of the subsidy that flows to banks from governments following a too-big-to-fail policy. With markets working under the assumption that they will invariably be protected by government, the cost of funds is measurably less, according to Haldane’s work, giving them preferential access to investment capital. He estimates the global subsidies enjoyed by the too-big-to-fails in 2009 ranged up to a staggering $2.3 trillion.[3]\n\nThus, I argue that sustaining too-big-to-fail-ism and maintaining the cocoon of protection of SIFIs is counterproductive, expensive and socially questionable.\n\nAs students, you should know that financial booms and busts are a recurring theme throughout history and that bankers and their regulators suffer from recurring amnesia. They periodically forget the past and all the lessons of history, tuck into some new financial, quick-profit fantasy—like the slicing and dicing and packaging of mortgage financing—and underestimate the risk of growing into unmanageable and unsustainable size, scale and complexity as they overindulge in that new financial fantasy. Invariably, these behemoth institutions use their size, scale and complexity to cow politicians and regulators into believing the world will be placed in peril should they attempt to discipline them. They argue that disciplining them will be a trip wire for financial contagion, market disruption and economic disorder. Yet failing to discipline them only delays the inevitable—a bursting of a bubble and a financial panic that places the economy in peril. This phenomenon most recently manifested itself in the Panic of 2008 and 2009.\n\nPaul Volcker states the problem thus: “The greatest structural challenge facing the financial system is how to deal with the widespread impression—many would say conviction—that important institutions are deemed ‘too large or too interconnected’ to fail.”[4]\n\nPaul ‘Moses’ and John Milton\nOn previous occasions, I have referred to Paul Volcker as the Moses of central bankers. He is an iconic figure who led us out of the desert of inflation and economic stagnation in the 1980s. Mr. Volcker is a man of principle and probity; is selfless and indifferent to financial gain; and is wise to the political shenanigans of powerful lobbies that perpetuate structural distortions that interfere with the public good. (In short, he is the perfect stuff of a central banker.) Most importantly, he understands the necessity of allowing for failure as a part of the process of creative destruction, especially so in the world of finance.\n\nHaving referred to Moses, I trust that in this academic setting, I might be forgiven if I draw upon one of my favorite literary references to failure, albeit one that is other-worldly. In Paradise Lost, John Milton has God telling us why he created men and angels, both of whom could betray Him:\n\nMilton considered the issue of failure on a much higher plane than the realm of bank regulatory policy. But the principle, expressed in that stanza of his paean to God’s creation of the “ethereal Powers,” applies equally to banking. Banks are created and given powers as mechanisms of credit intermediation, in order to allow an economy to grow and become prosperous. Yet, if regulators—who oversee the creation of banks and monitor their business—can’t secure capital structures at our largest financial institutions that are “just and right,” and do not allow for institutions that “betray” their creators to be “free to fall,” it is unlikely those financial institutions will fulfill their proper intermediary role and be agents of economic prosperity.\n\nThus far, regulators have failed in their mission of warding off betrayal.\n\nPerpetuating Obesity\nWith each passing year, the banking industry has become more concentrated. Half of the entire banking industry’s assets are now on the books of five institutions. Their combined assets presently equate to roughly 58 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP). The combined assets of the 10 largest depository institutions equate to 65 percent of the banking industry’s assets and 75 percent of our GDP.\n\nSome of this ongoing consolidation is the result of a dynamic set in place by Congress’ passage of interstate branching legislation in 1994 and repeal of Glass–Steagall provisions in 1999. But some of it also reflects the result of the recent financial crisis. When difficulties began to appear at large financial institutions, resolution policies often entailed their merger or acquisition with other large institutions. Add to this the regulatory forbearance and financial backstops that tend to be granted to the largest banks in exigent circumstances, and the end result is a few financial behemoths, each with well over a trillion dollars in assets and a heavy concentration of power. In fact, the top three U.S. bank holding companies each presently have assets of roughly $2 trillion or more.\n\nOf course, problems in the banking sector have not been exclusively confined to large financial institutions. Regional and community banks have faced their own problems, especially connected to construction lending. But here is the rub: When smaller banks get in trouble, regulators step in and resolve them. The term “resolve” in the context of smaller banks is a fancy way of saying their demise was quickly and nondisruptively arranged—they were disposed of. We might have expected equal treatment of big banks, but, of course, that did not happen.6 To be sure, some very large financial firms have ceased to exist or have been through a corporate reorganization with some of the characteristics of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy. But these institutions deemed “too big to fail,” and deemed to be “systemically” important due to their size and complexity, were given preferential treatment. Many were absorbed by still larger financial institutions, thus perpetuating and exacerbating the phenomenon of too big to fail.\n\nThis problem of supersized and hypercomplex banks is not unique to the United States. Europe is struggling today with how to cushion its megabanks from excessive exposure to intra-European sovereign debt. And Japan is still feeling the negative impacts of not successfully resolving the financial difficulties at its megabanks two decades ago.\n\nA Perverse Lake Wobegon\nWhy are too-big-to-fail institutions treated differently than smaller banks? Even Vinny Guadagnino knows the obvious answer to that question: In a system of large and/or interconnected banks, difficulties at one institution can easily spill over and take down other banks or even the entire industry. Fear of “systemic risk” conditions the treatment of financial behemoths.\n\nIn today’s interconnected, globalized financial system, systemic risk is more pronounced than ever. And we know that when a systemic crisis occurs—as it did in the Panic of 2008–09—the results can be catastrophic to the economy. Small wonder that in commenting on the problems currently besetting Europe, the U.S. Treasury secretary recently stated, “The threat of cascading default, bank runs and catastrophic risk must be taken off the table.”[7] This has become dogma among banking regulators and their minders. Thus, in the recently announced Greek bond deal, the Euro Summit Statement tells us that “Greece requires an exceptional and unique solution.”[8]\n\nSuch a solution is certainly in the interest of American bankers. In Saturday’s New York Times, it was reported that the Congressional Research Service has estimated that the exposure of U.S. banks to Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain amounted to $641 billion; American banks’ exposure to German and French banks was in excess of an additional $1.2 trillion. According to the Bank for International Settlements, U.S. banks have $757 billion in derivative contracts and $650 billion in credit commitments from European banks. Thus, the Congressional Research Service concluded that “a collapse of a major European bank could produce similar problems in U.S. institutions.”[9]\n\nIn the land of the too-big-to-fails, we find ourselves in something akin to a perverse financial Lake Wobegon: All crises are “exceptional,” and all require “unique solution(s).”\n\nYet, it seems to me that in our desire to avoid “cascading default” and “catastrophic risk,” and in our search for “exceptional and unique solution(s),” we may well be compounding systemic risk rather than solving it. By seeking to postpone the comeuppance of investors, lenders and bank managers who made imprudent decisions, we incur the wrath of ordinary citizens and smaller entities that resent this favorable treatment, and we plant the seeds of social unrest. We also impede the ability of the market to clear or, to paraphrase Milton, allow the marketplace to distinguish “freely” those who should stand and those who should fall.\n\nEnter Dodd–Frank\nI said earlier that financial crises are nothing new. Nor is the response to them: a flurry of legislation that ends up giving more power to regulators in the hope of preventing the next crisis. The Glass–Steagall Act was enacted during the Great Depression, the FDIC Improvement Act after the banking and savings-and-loan troubles in the late 1980s. And now, in response to the Panic of 2008–09, we are implementing the Dodd–Frank Act.\n\nDodd–Frank—which is over 2,000 pages long, contains 16 titles, 38 subtitles and a total of 541 sections—is the most complex document ever written in the history of efforts to change the financial regulatory landscape. A cheeky historian might recall French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau’s reaction to Woodrow Wilson’s 14 points, proposed as a safeguard for world peace after World War I: Clemenceau is reported to have thought that God did a pretty good job with only 10.\n\nWhether it is through 10 commandments or 14 points, or over 2,000 pages, the question is: Does Dodd–Frank appropriately confront systemic risk and the associated problem of too big to fail? Its preamble certainly states a desire to do so, declaring boldly that its purpose is to “end ‘too big to fail’” and “protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts.”[10]\n\nDodd–Frank does, in fact, contain a number of measures that attempt to address too-big-to-fail-ism. It creates a Financial Stability Oversight Council—or FSOC—composed of the major financial-sector regulators charged with overseeing the entire financial system. The FSOC can recommend that important nonbank firms be brought under the regulatory umbrella. Those who will be brought under that umbrella will be subjected to periodic stress tests to make sure they can withstand reversals in the economy and other adverse developments. Dodd–Frank calls for enhanced capital requirements for SIFIs. And it provides for a new authority for resolving bank holding companies and other financial institutions that wasn’t available to authorities during the recent crisis.\n\nImplementing Dodd–Frank\nWill it work? Will Dodd–Frank achieve the desired goals declared in its preamble? The devil, as always, is in the details of how the legislation is implemented.\n\nAt the most basic level, the legislation leaves many of the details to rulemakings by various regulatory agencies; more than one year after enactment, there is still much work to be done in actually implementing the act. On Nov. 1, the law firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell released its monthly progress report on Dodd–Frank implementation. According to that report, of the 400 rulings required by the legislation, 173, or roughly 43 percent, have not yet been proposed by regulators. Of the 141 rulemakings required of bank regulators—the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Office of the Comptroller of the Currencey—58, or about 41 percent, have not yet been proposed.[11]\n\nCapital Requirements and an Atomic Reaction\nWhile acknowledging that the specific regulations spawned by Dodd–Frank have yet to be perfected, one of the harshest criticisms of its treatment of SIFIs has come from my former colleague and president of the Kansas City Fed, Tom Hoenig, who is now the nominee to be vice chair of the FDIC. He has argued that the very existence of SIFIs is “fundamentally inconsistent with capitalism” and “inherently destabilizing to global markets and detrimental to world growth.”[12] Moreover, according to Mr. Hoenig—who had unquestionably the greatest depth of regulatory experience of all the Federal Reserve presidents and governors—even with the completion of Dodd–Frank, the existence of too-big-to-fail institutions will likely remain and “poses the greatest risk to the U.S. economy.”[13]\n\nOne might counter that the enhanced capital requirements envisioned by Dodd–Frank—being negotiated presently by the Fed and other regulators nationally and internationally—will be a fitting treatment for too-big-to-fail-ism. In theory, it certainly sounds good. But as Paul Volcker has pointed out, “That’s an old story.”[14] We’ve had a system of international risk-based capital requirements in place for some time under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements, beginning with Basel I in the early 1990s. That morphed into Basel II in the early 2000s, and now we are introducing Basel III. In fact, in the U.S., we can go all the way back to the National Bank Act of 1864 to find a system of capital requirements on banks.\n\nCapital requirements are indeed important. A strong capital base protects a business when times get tough, giving it reserves to draw upon so that it can wait out a storm. Applied to banks, it also should mitigate risk-taking incentives that are an inevitable by-product of our too-big-to-fail system: If you put meaningful shareholder money directly at risk, managers of banks beholden to those shareholders will be less tempted to take pie-eyed risks.[15]\n\nThe operative word in the previous sentence is “meaningful.” The existing regulatory measures were found wanting on measures of meaningful capital. For example, at the height of the crisis in mid-2008, two of the largest, most troubled institutions—Citigroup and Bank of America—were considered “adequately capitalized” (or even higher), according to the then-prevailing regulatory criteria. The Belgian bank Dexia is another case in point. In a press release issued just last May, it highlighted its regulatory capital ratio of 13.4 percent as “confirming our Group’s high level of solvency.”[16]\n\nWinston Churchill used the phrase “terminological inexactitude” to suggest a certain lack of directness; one might easily conclude that there was some “inexactitude” surrounding the capital structures of Citi, Bank of America and Dexia.\n\nI return to Andrew Haldane of the Bank of England. Haldane makes an intriguing parallel between the financial system and epidemiological networks. Conventional capital requirements seek to equalize failure probabilities across institutions to a certain threshold, say 0.1 percent. But using a systemwide approach would result in a different calibration, if the objective were to set a firm’s capital requirements equal to the marginal cost of its failure to the system as a whole. Regulatory capital requirements would then be higher for banks posing the greatest risk to the system, which is what Dodd–Frank proposes, and what the current Basel III requirements are also considering.\n\nTo Haldane, this is a new approach in banking, but not in epidemiology where “focusing preventive action on ‘super-spreaders’ within the network to limit the potential for systemwide spread” is the norm. As Haldane emphasizes, “If anything, this same logic applies with even greater force in banking.”[17] To me, treating too-big-to-fail institutions as potential “super-spreaders” of financial germs has a great deal of appeal.\n\nThe latest round of international capital standards is seeking to correct for “terminological inexactitude” and tighten up the definition of what banks can count as capital, so as to prevent “super-spreading.” That’s good news. Yet, this effort is being met with fierce resistance from the SIFIs. Tom Hoenig once suggested that when regulators begin the process of tightening up the latitude granted the megabanks, they will find themselves “facing an atomic force of resistance.”[18] He appears to have been spot on. The head of one of the major U.S. financial institutions has called these new proposals “anti-American.”[19] Last Thursday, the Wall Street Journal wrote of “bankers seething over rising … capital requirements.”[20] Such is the intensity of emotion to resist the work of the Fed and other regulators as they seek to protect the system from the pernicious risk inherent in the existence of megabanks.\n\nWe cannot let that resistance prevail.\n\nAnd we must insist, as Dodd–Frank does, that SIFIs be required to submit a “living will” that describes their orderly demise. Credit exposure reports must also be submitted periodically to estimate the extent of SIFI interconnectedness. We must see to it that the FDIC “ensure(s) that the shareholders of a covered financial company … not receive payment until after all other claims … are fully paid.”[21] This is essential to restoring the discipline of the marketplace and is what the Fed expects to achieve when it finalizes its work on Section 165 and other aspects of the legislation, as discussed last week by Vice Chair Janet Yellen in a speech in Chicago.[22]\n\nAn Achilles' Heel\nFor all that it specifies to treat the unhealthy obesity and complexity of too-big-to-fails, Dodd–Frank has an Achilles' heel. It states that in the disposition of assets, the FDIC shall “to the greatest extent practicable, conduct its operations in a manner that … mitigates the potential for serious adverse effects to the financial system.”[23] This is entirely desirable; nobody wants to initiate serious financial disruption. But directing the FDIC to mitigate the potential for serious adverse effects leaves plenty of wiggle room for fears of “cascading defaults” and “catastrophic risk” to perpetuate “exceptional and unique” treatments, should push again come to shove.\n\nI may be excessively skeptical on this front. Vigilantes of the bond and stock market, of which I was once a part, have been demanding greater transparency in reporting the exposures of the megabanks, including a more fulsome account of both gross and net exposures of credit default swaps. And Moody’s has recently downgraded the long-term debt of major U.S. and U.K. banks. This is oddly reassuring. Moody’s said that “actions already taken by U.K. authorities have significantly reduced the predictability of support over the medium to long term,”[24] whereas in the U.S., it found “a decrease in the probability that the U.S. government would support [major banks].”[25]\n\nOf course, the ratings agencies did not exactly cover themselves in glory during the crisis. Let’s hope their assessment of at least somewhat more limited government support for the megabanks proves more accurate than the triple-A ratings they gave to so many mortgage-backed securities.\n\nThe Alternative: Radical Surgery\nIn short, progress is being made in the direction of treating the pathology of SIFIs and the detailing of enhanced prudential standards governing their behavior. Yet, in my view, there is only one fail-safe way to deal with too big to fail. I believe that too-big-to-fail banks are too-dangerous-to-permit.[26] As Mervyn King, head of the Bank of England, once said, “If some banks are thought to be too big to fail, then … they are too big.” I favor an international accord that would break up these institutions into more manageable size. More manageable not only for regulators, but also for the executives of these institutions. For there is scant chance that managers of $1 trillion or $2 trillion banking enterprises can possibly “know their customer,” follow time-honored principles of banking and fashion reliable risk management models for organizations as complex as these megabanks have become.\n\nAm I too radical? I think not. I find myself in good company—Paul Volcker, for example, advocates “reducing their size, curtailing their interconnectedness, or limiting their activities.”[27]\n\nIn my view, downsizing the behemoths over time into institutions that can be prudently managed and regulated across borders is the appropriate policy response. Then, creative destruction can work its wonders in the financial sector, just as it does elsewhere in our economy.\n\nWe shouldn’t just pay lip service to letting the discipline of the market work. Ideally, we should rely on market forces to work not only in good times, but also in times of difficulties. Ultimately, we should move to end too big to fail and the apparatus of bailouts and do so well before bankers lose their memory of the recent crisis and embark on another round of excessive risk taking. Only then will we have a financial system fit and proper for servicing an economy as dynamic as that of the United States.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "November 2, 2011 New York City\n\nThis is an important evening. We gather under the name of Frédéric Bastiat to celebrate those who write about free markets, a concept that for many of today’s foremost economic policy pundits is as provocative as a Texan evoking the virtues of a Frenchman.\n\nBastiat would no doubt be pleased that this most famous of dining rooms is not lit by candlelight, but by the agent of creative destruction that is electricity. Of course, the term “creative destruction” is Joseph Schumpeter’s, not Bastiat’s. Like Bastiat, Schumpeter was an eccentric. Having immigrated to America and to Harvard, Schumpeter was said to introduce himself to his first class by saying he wished to be considered “the greatest economist in the world, the greatest horseman in Austria and the best lover in Vienna.” To which he quickly added, “I never became the greatest horseman in Austria.” Schumpeter was impossibly vain, but discerning. It is no small thing that he described Bastiat as “the most brilliant economic journalist who ever lived.”[1]\n\nIn July, Jim Grant wrote a fine piece on Bastiat for the Wall Street Journal, titled “For Love of Laissez-Faire,” reviewing an English-language collection of Bastiat’s letters titled The Man and the Statesman. Grant quotes Bastiat as praising the qualities of readable literature as follows: “It has to be short, clear, accurate and as full of feeling as of ideas, all at the same time.”[2] You might be aghast at my quoting Keynes as having suggested what I think might be a good addendum to Bastiat’s literary advice: “Words ought to be a little wild, for they are the assault of thoughts upon the unthinking.”[3]\n\nTonight, we celebrate a small coterie of women and men who write “short, clear, accurate” articles that are “full of feeling” for the idea of free markets and, if not necessarily wild, do, in fact, frontally assault run-of-the-mill thinking.\n\nTonight, we celebrate not just free markets, but freedom itself. Freedom to express thought. Freedom to challenge convention. Freedom to be heard and to be seen and felt doing so.\n\n“The cause of freedom is not the cause of a race or a sect, a party or a class—it is the cause of human kind, the very birthright of humanity.”[4] Anna Julia Cooper, the daughter of a slave and one of the first African-American women to earn a doctorate—at the University of Paris, no less—said that.\n\n“Don’t wink at a girl in the dark.” My father said that.\n\nAmity was kind to mention my dad and what he overcame. Like Bastiat, my father was orphaned at a young age—at the age of 6. Unlike Bastiat, he did not inherit an estate in Mugron. In fact, until he was picked up by local magistrates in Queensland, he and his father, my grandfather, begged for food on the streets in the aftermath of the depression that gripped Australia at the turn of the previous century. Unlike Ms. Cooper, he never received an education. He barely made it through fourth grade; he certainly did not get a formal education in economics. Yet, like Ms. Cooper, he understood the romance and power of freedom. And he understood what Bastiat taught us all: He understood an idea that is “full of feeling,” unseen or improperly communicated, is the equivalent of the proverbial tree that falls in the forest. He could not have spelled it, but he instinctively understood the meaning of praxeology; his quip about winking is as good as any to remind economists of the need to understand the basics of human action and reaction when they ply their models and their prescriptions for what ails us.\n\nThe nice things that Amity said about me were all made possible because my father and mother came to America. Because they believed that here, more than anywhere else, human endeavor was prized, and that here, freedom was and is the “birthright of humanity.” Having been a ward of the state, my father taught his son—me—that individual effort is the sole proven basis for advancement; that dependence on government, which he managed to escape, is just another word for entrapment and, however well intentioned, severely regressive.\n\nMost everyone in this room tonight is concerned that, as Bastiat wrote in the aftermath of the French Revolution of 1848, we are at risk of becoming a nation where “the state is responsible for providing a living for everyone.”[5] The reality is that even if this were desirable, which it is not, pliant fiscal authorities—Republican and Democrat—who have led us down this road for decades find themselves in a financial cul de sac; they have run out of enabling money.\n\nOf course, they could skip the curb and keep on moving in the same direction were the central bank to accommodate them by monetizing their debts. But we all know that ends ultimately in the most ruinous of scenarios, the onset of hyperinflation. It is a far better thing for them to face up to the fact that they have been improvident and must now change their ways—that they must not, and cannot, hide under the skirts of the Federal Reserve. The central bank must never become an accomplice to feckless government. Indeed, as we at the Fed and central banks worldwide are guardians of a fiat currency—a faith-based currency—it is imperative that we never, ever, ever, be seen to have the slightest inclination to countenance doing so. For that fragile faith, once violated, can never be restored.\n\nTo be fair, our politicians develop their initiatives according to what gets them elected and reelected. This is how a democracy works. Those of us who cherish freedom know that democracy is freedom’s great enabler. Thus, it is incumbent upon all of us to provide the people with the information they need to make informed judgments, not in obscure math published in elite journals, but in plain language they understand, disseminated through media they can readily access.\n\nThe awardees tonight do all of us one better: They strip bare the hypocrisy of the nanny state, see through the veil of differential calculus and complex formulae that modern economists have come to rely upon, and in the very best tradition of Bastiat and his disciples, appeal to logic to expose the unintended consequences and longer-term effects of popular policy prescriptions. They do so in readable form that would do Bastiat proud: They wink in the brightest of daylight, communicating their passion for free markets for all to see. Tonight, we honor their courage. We applaud the strength of their conviction and obstinacy in sticking to their principles. And not unimportantly—thanks to Tom Smith, Pamela Hoiles, Charles Kadlec, Jim Piereson and others—we reward them with generous prizes so that they will keep on doing what they do so well: Articulating the virtues of free and open markets.\n\nAfter dinner—and what I am certain will be a far more entertaining speech than this one, by Professor [Russ] Roberts—this year’s Hoiles Prize and Bastiat Prize will be presented. I was honored to be a judge for the latter. I learned something from each of the articles I read from each of the six worthy Bastiat Prize finalists. You are all bright, shining stars. Yet, Amity, being the discreet task master and master of surprise that she is, has not even revealed the winner to the judges. I am eager to find out. So in my best Texan imitation of what I am sure was the most frequent of all of Bastiat’s exhortations: À table et place au spectacle. Let’s eat and get on with the show. Mille fois merci.",

            "content": "October 21, 2011 Dallas, Texas\n\nIt has been decades since I was an active member of this prestigious forum. Last night, I attended a book party for Kathryn McGarr, Cappy McGarr and Janie Strauss McGarr’s daughter. She has written a zinger of a book about her mother’s uncle, Bob Strauss, one of our most accomplished and colorful public servants.[1]\n\nThe evening brought to mind the time—I believe it was in 1979 or thereabouts—when Bob was U.S. trade representative and spoke to the Friday Group. He was introduced by his brother Ted, who gave such an admiring and thorough background introduction that it went on longer than Bob had time to speak. When Bob finally stood up to the podium, right off the bat he was vintage Strauss: “G-- d---it Ted, I asked for an introduction, not a G-- d---ed travelogue!” (And it wasn’t “Gosh darned.”)\n\nEven if I had the temerity to speak like Bob Strauss, I’d have no need to do so today. That was a nice, short intro, Mark [Sinclair]. Thank you.\n\nLeaders at the Dallas Fed\n\nBefore getting into the substance of my talk, I am going to let you in on a little secret. As mentioned, I am, indeed, the CEO of a $110 billion bank, the largest in Texas, the ultimate banker’s Bank of this region. But while CEOs get all the credit for running a business, the truth is they are only as good as the people they have operating their business. With me today are some of the key operators of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas; I want to single them out:\n\nHelen Holcomb is my chief operating officer and chair of our senior management committee. Helen operates the Bank with remarkable efficiency and is a person of wise and insightful judgment. I do not do a thing without first consulting Helen.\n\nMeredith Black wears two hats as our chief financial officer and chief information officer. Meredith plays a key role in management of the Federal Reserve System’s information technology, on which we spend over $1 billion a year.\n\nJoanna Kolson is our senior vice president in charge of cash operations. About $105 billion in Federal Reserve notes—ones and twos, fives and tens, twenties and fifties and one-hundred-dollar bills—passed through our vaults last year. Joanna is known as the “keeper of the vault,” in addition to overseeing the management of all of our facilities.\n\nAnn Worthy runs our lending operations—we lent over $30 billion to banks in Texas during the financial crisis in 2009 to assist them with their operating needs. Ann’s keen eye made sure we were paid everything back, and at a profit.\n\nAnd Mine Yücel is our senior economist. Mine was born and educated in Turkey and received her PhD from Rice. She is the Dallas Fed’s leading expert on our region and also a renowned energy economist, serving as president of the International Association of Energy Economics.\n\nEach of you has the image of a Federal Reserve note—what you call a dollar bill—at your seat. In the middle of the left side of that note is the letter “K,” surrounded by two concentric circles. The outer circle says “Federal Reserve Texas;” the inner circle reads “Bank of Dallas.” K is the 11th letter in the alphabet; the number 11 is printed in each of the four corners of the bill. There are 12 Federal Reserve Banks, all founded in 1913; the Dallas Fed and its branches in Houston, San Antonio and El Paso constitute the Eleventh Federal Reserve District, serving some 27 million people over an expanse of 360,000 square miles and with economic output that exceeds that of Australia and only recently fell behind that of India. (I like to tease my colleagues at the other 11 Federal Reserve Banks that our “Dallas dollars” represent greater nominal value than all the rest.)\n\nI am blessed to serve as the president and CEO of the Dallas Fed. But in reality, I am just a pretty face; the muscle and brains of the Dallas Fed are these brilliant women and the men and women they work with and lead. Please join me in thanking them for what they do.\n\n‘Help Me Out’\n\nLast week, I was in Washington. I had breakfast with a wise and worldly old friend from my days as a trade negotiator for the United States—Mike Moore, the former prime minister of New Zealand and director-general of the World Trade Organization who is now New Zealand’s ambassador to Washington. Ambassador Moore’s perspectives are different from mine; I always find them thought-provoking. The ambassador is blessed with a keen mind and the ability to deploy a pungent sense of humor, usually wrapped in a memorable analogy, in order to convey a serious message. He told me the story of a God-fearing man who prayed several times a day, imploring the Lord to let him win the lottery. Day after day, year after year, God listened to this man. Finally, He grew weary of the man’s prayers and spoke to him: “Help me out, my son, so that I might help you,” the Lord said. “Buy a ticket!”\n\nThis afternoon, I am going to make reference to the Federal Reserve and the job of a central banker. This is what I do for a living, and it has become reflexive for me to explain my, and my colleagues’, calling. Mark has asked me to broaden my theme today, however, and I am going to do just that: I am going to suggest that our nation has a crying need for public leadership to correct what is wrong with our economy; that the Federal Reserve has provided the leadership required of it; that monetary policy cannot do it alone and must be complemented by responsible fiscal policy—policy that is exclusively the responsibility of those whom we elect to represent us in Washington; that rather than posturing for political expediency and positioning for victory at the polls in November 2012, our nation’s political leaders need to actually “buy a ticket” and put themselves at risk, right now and without delay. Each passing day they fail to do so further jeopardizes our economic stability and our nation’s future.\n\nUnemployment Is THE Issue\n\nOur great country now finds itself in a very difficult economic predicament. It is true that the situation here in Texas is relatively better than that of the nation; Texas is an oasis in a national economic desert devoid of life-giving job creation. We went into the Great Recession last and were one of the first to come out. As we have for the past 40 years, we continue to outpace the rest of the United States in employment growth by a significant margin. Since the recession officially ended in June 2009, only North Dakota (a plucky state whose population is less than that of Collin or Denton counties) has seen faster job growth than Texas.\n\nAs I speak, Texas has almost as many people employed as we did before the recession began. Our banks are in better shape than those in the rest of the country. We are benefiting from the blessings of nature, with copious amounts of oil and gas and abundant agricultural production. Our fellow citizens have seen to it that our Legislature continues to hew to a tax, regulatory and legal environment that attracts job-creating investment and encourages business formation and growth.\n\nAnd yet, even in this blessed state, there are too many unemployed and underemployed, just as there are in the rest of America. We can do better. America must do better.\n\nThe question is: How?\n\nTo create employment, we must have economic growth.\n\nThe simplest of econometric equations posits that the key components of economic growth are: domestic consumption, plus foreign demand for U.S.-produced exports, plus investment by businesses, plus spending by government.\n\nI think it is pretty clear to everyone who lives on the planet that in order to expand our economy and put our people back to work, we must rely on our ability to curry to domestic and foreign consumption and invest here at home to produce the goods and services to sell into the marketplace here and abroad. You’d have to be from Mars to believe that our financially strapped federal and state governments will be the source of much direct spending stimulus to the economy going forward.\n\nAesop’s Fable\n\nPresently, all eyes are focused on the ongoing budget deliberations in Washington. During the summer debt-ceiling negotiations, I was reminded of Aesop’s classic fable. Rather than work like ants to build and store for difficult times, our fiscal authorities—Congress after Congress, under Republican and Democrat leadership alike, and with presidents of both parties occupying the White House—have been proverbial grasshoppers. Except for a few interludes, they have partied along for decades using the people’s money as though life were an endless summer, storing nothing to draw upon for the blustery fall and the bleak winter that inevitably follow. Now a fiscal reckoning is upon us. The gig is up. Congress can no longer carry on as before, oblivious to the deleterious effect of spending our, and the successor generations’, money with unfunded abandon.\n\nTongues firmly in cheek, clever pundits have reminded us that there are alternative versions of this fable. In 1924, Somerset Maugham wrote a version about two brothers: one an ant-like hard worker and the other a grasshopper wastrel. In the end, the grasshopper marries a rich widow, who dies and leaves him a fortune.[2] Case closed! In Things Change, a film released by Columbia Pictures in 1988, the character played by Don Ameche recites a version in which the grasshopper, fed up with all this moralizing about the virtues of hard work and saving for a rainy day, just up and eats the ants.\n\nI think we can safely assume that neither of these scenarios will occur. No one is going to bail out our federal government at the last minute; there is no rich-widow equivalent for rescuing fiscal spendthrifts. The ants that are the hardworking taxpayers are, if anything, poised to chew up and spit out improvident politicians should they fail to put an end to fiscal profligacy. The fiscal authorities have no choice but to come to terms with the need to bring about a better balance between taxes and spending and to not only bend the curve, but also reverse the inexorable growth in federal debt accumulation. This is the stuff of the great negotiations taking place in Washington.\n\nNo Small Chore\n\nThis is no small chore. The parties involved must stop the hemorrhaging without inducing cardiac arrest; they must solve the long-run debt and deficit problem without, in the short run, pushing the economy back into recession, creating still more unemployment. And they not only must confront their addiction to debt and spending beyond their means, but also reorganize the tax system, redirect the money they spend and rewrite the regulations they create so as to be competitive in a world that wants to beat us at our own game.\n\nThis is an essential point. My wife, Nancy, is in Vietnam as we speak. Imagine that! When she and I were in college, we were at war, killing the Vietnamese. And they were killing us, including my close friend and high school football teammate, Greg Lavery, who was shot dead by a Vietcong sniper as he patrolled a rice paddy in 1968. Today, my wife is free to walk unafraid across a rice paddy or through the streets of Saigon and Hanoi. American companies trade and invest in Vietnam, and Vietnamese companies do so here. This is good news! We won the Cold War. Ho Chi Minh and Mao Zedong and all the brutal dictators who ruled the Soviet Union are long gone. In the blink of history’s eye, we have gone from mutually assured destruction on the battlefield to mutually reinforcing competition in the marketplace. This is what we spent an entire generation of American blood and treasure to achieve, and it is a far better thing.\n\nThe consequence, however, is that we are now being challenged as the place to invest job-creating capital by the Vietnamese, the Chinese, the Indians and countless others who have decided to engage full bore in the commercial interplay of a global economy. Our business operators are obligated by their shareholders and their creditors to earn a return on investment and maximize profit; we live in a globalized, interconnected world, and money is free to go to wherever it earns the best return. The point is that our fiscal and regulatory authorities do not operate in a vacuum. It will not be enough to reach a real deal on the debt ceiling or on reining in deficits. In the post-Cold War, post-Bamboo Curtain world, there are many governments and great swathes of people outside the United States that want to attract investment and improve their lot.\n\nIn crafting a solution to the nation’s fiscal crisis, our political leaders must take this new reality into account and develop an entirely new structure of incentives for private businesses and investors to put their money to work creating jobs, here at home rather than abroad.\n\nOnly fiscal authorities have the power to affect this outcome. Monetary authorities, like me and my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the Federal Reserve, have limited influence. We can fill the gas tank with attractively priced fuel—abundant and cheap money—needed to propel the economy. But we cannot trigger the impulse to step on the pedal and engage the transmission mechanism of job-creating investment by the private sector. This is the province of those who write our laws and regulations—the Congress of the United States.\n\nThe Limits of Monetary Policy\n\nI happen to believe that the Federal Reserve is exhausting the limits of prudent monetary policy. The programs popularly known as QE2 and Operation Twist are, to my way of thinking, of doubtful efficacy, which is why I have not been able to support them. I suspect that, at least in the case of Operation Twist, they have so far been of greater benefit to traders and large monied interests than to job-creating businesses. But even if you believe, as the majority of my learned colleagues do, that the benefits of QE2 and Operation Twist outweigh their costs, you would be hard-pressed to now say that still more liquidity, or more fuel, is called for given the $1.5 trillion in excess bank reserves and the substantial liquid holdings businesses are hoarding above their normal working-capital needs.\n\nEven surveys of small businesses—for example, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s survey of companies with less than $25 million in sales and fewer than 500 employees conducted in July, or the National Federation of Independent Business survey of September—indicate that fewer than 10 percent of small enterprises (which employ half of the private sector’s workers) are having problems accessing credit.[3]\n\nI would submit that adding more liquidity, or making money still cheaper, is not the answer to our problems.\n\nEconomic Forecast—Caveat Emptor\n\nWith monetary policy having broached what I consider to be the limits of accommodation, and the federal government at sixes and sevens, what then is the economic outlook? Are we going to grow through the rest of the year and on into the next, or are we going to dip back into recession?\n\nForecasting economic growth is not a precise business. Economics is an art form, not a science; it is very judgmental and subjective. The FOMC is composed of 17 thoughtful, introspective and deliberate men and women. Five of the members who serve full time are in Washington as governors of the Federal Reserve Board, appointed by presidents of the United States with the approval of Congress. The remaining 12, like me, are presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks, chosen by nine-member, nonpolitical boards of directors of citizens in their districts and charged with conducting the business of the Fed in the field based on our acumen and with developing policy insights based upon what we see, hear and measure on Main Street. Together, the 17 of us formulate policy with the best judgment we can collectively muster, focused on what is in the best long-term interest of the country’s economy. This is critical for the nation: Your central bank must remain independent of political influence, free from political pressures or the passions of the moment.\n\nWithin the FOMC, we each develop forecasts for the economy. To provide those forecasts, we employ sophisticated econometric models, study the entrails of numerous comprehensive surveys conducted all across the nation—like the Dallas Fed’s Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey and the Texas Retail Outlook Survey (developed under the watchful eye of Mine Yücel), and counterpart surveys conducted by other Federal Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors—and draw upon input from our boards of directors, numerous advisory boards and contacts with businesses and stakeholders nationwide and worldwide. These forecasts are helpful guideposts, but they must be kept in context.\n\nKenneth Arrow, a Nobel Laureate in economics, had his own perspective on forecasting. During World War II, he served as a weather officer in the U.S. Army Air Corps and worked with a team charged with the particularly difficult task of producing month-ahead weather forecasts. As Arrow and his team reviewed these predictions, they confirmed statistically what you and I might just as easily have guessed: The corps’ weather forecasts were no more useful than random rolls of a die. Understandably, the forecasters asked to be relieved of this seemingly futile duty. Arrow’s recollection of his superiors’ response was priceless: “The commanding general is well aware that the forecasts are no good. However, he needs them for planning purposes.”[4]\n\nKeep Professor Arrow in mind when you hear economists tout precise forecasts carried out several places to the right of the decimal point. You may need economists’ forecasts for planning purposes, but you should always take them with a grain of salt, even when the time horizon is a short one. I direct you to an article in the Feb. 14 edition of the Wall Street Journal as evidence. The Journal had polled 51 leading economists, and they forecast that gross domestic product would expand 3.6 percent in that very same first quarter, ending in less than a month’s time.[5] Growth came in at 1.9 percent.\n\nHeaded in the Right Direction…Slowly\n\nWhen economists forecast we will have growth of, say 3.6 percent, remember they are saying point-zero, three-six. It is an elaborate conceit to think anybody can be that precise in an economy as large as that of the United States, operating as it does within the context of an even larger, very dynamic, global economy. This is true for Fed economists as well as academics and those who sell their forecasts for a living. What matters most to me is the direction in which the numbers are headed and the general sense of momentum.\n\nAt this juncture, I think it sufficient to say that—assuming the people we elect to tax us and spend our money and create the rules and regulations that govern our economic behavior can get their act together, confront their own denial of most rudimentary budgetary discipline, learn to shoot straight and remove the Damocles Sword of uncertainty that they have for too long wielded over our job-creating private sector—there is plenty of potential for confidence to be bolstered and propel the economy forward at an accelerating clip. This is especially the case now that the Fed has reliquified the economy.\n\nWe need not remain stuck in the low gear of the first half of this year. Some of the temporary influences that I believe retarded growth in the first half—high gasoline and unprocessed-food prices, the supply disruptions in Japan, etc.—have passed through the system and are either being reversed or digested. To be sure, some businesses are being hit with higher input costs from imported goods and other nonlabor cost increases. Having become as lean as possible and having learned to preserve their margins by years of tight cost management and by maximizing productivity, they don’t have much fat to absorb the cost of input increases. If input price increases continue or spread, these businesses will naturally attempt to pass them on to consumers, who are wary of anything else that will compress their living standards.\n\nInflation?\n\nBut I see a bit of a tug-of-war developing here. The issue will be whether businesses can exercise pricing power in the face of fallow consumer demand and high unemployment. As an inflation “hawk”—I don’t particularly like that term; I prefer to think of myself and my 16 colleagues, hawks and doves alike, as wise owls, but so be it—I am watching this very carefully. I am aware that the Producer Price Index remains stout and that consumer prices remain sticky at current high levels. If I see inflation continuing to rise and, most important, inflationary expectations beginning to spread, I will be the first out of the box to advocate the removal of the substantial monetary accommodation now in place. I cannot think of anything more damaging to the welfare of hardworking Americans who have jobs, those who are unemployed and barely eking out a living, retirees who are earning minimum returns on their savings, or any consumer already stretched thin, than to have their purchasing power reduced by still-higher inflation. Adding the suffix “flation” to the present stagnation will only result in “stagflation,” the worst of both worlds. This affliction, for example, appears to be taking place in the U.K. and is most vexing for the Bank of England.\n\nPresently, however, I don’t consider stagflation the most likely U.S. outcome. The Dallas Fed has its own measure of inflation. We track the prices of 178 items people actually use—from the cost of gasoline and food to the price paid a hairdresser and to have one’s shoes repaired, the cost of guns and ammunition, beer (my favorite, being the son of an Australian who considered beer one of the basic food groups) and even funerals—in a series we have tracked and updated since 1977. We trim away abnormal monthly squiggles and calculate an underlying trend rate of inflation known as Trimmed Mean Personal Consumption Expenditures. We have found this to be the most accurate forecaster of the direction of inflation.\n\nThe six-month rate of the trimmed mean is 2 percent through August. Thus, we expect the more conventional headline indexes—now running at 3.9 percent, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, and 3 percent, as measured by the last reported personal consumption expenditures index—to gravitate toward the 2 percent level.\n\nJob Creation Is THE Problem\n\nThe problem presently afflicting the nation is not inflation; it is job creation. Our most urgent issue is creating jobs and reducing unemployment. We have too many people out of work and for too long. This is why people have taken to the streets in New York, Boston, Philadelphia and elsewhere in those demonstrations so widely reported in the media. When people are out of work, they get desperate; when masses of people are out of work, you have the recipe for social unrest.\n\nAs I said earlier, the Federal Reserve has filled the tanks with the liquidity, or fuel, needed to create jobs. But only the fiscal authorities—the Congress and the executive branch—can provide the tax, spending and regulatory incentives to induce the private sector to step on the accelerator and engage the transmission of job creation.\n\nEvoking Dr. King\n\nAt the beginning of this talk, I mentioned Ambassador Mike Moore of New Zealand. His most recent book is dedicated “To honorable public servants, elected or otherwise,” as he put it. He then inserts a quote from Martin Luther King Jr. as follows:\n\n“Cowardice asks the question—is it safe? Expediency asks the question—is it politic? Vanity asks the question—is it popular? But conscience asks the question—is it right? … There comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe, nor politic, nor popular, but one must take it because it is right.”[6]\n\nI would suggest to you that the time is now. Our nation’s economy is at risk. The Federal Reserve is doing everything it can to bolster unemployment without forsaking our sacred commitment to maintaining price stability. I personally don’t care which party is in the White House or controls Congress. All I know is that the “honorable” members of Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, have conspired over time, however unwittingly, to drive fiscal policy into the ditch. They purchased their elections and reelections with popular programs so poorly funded that they now threaten the economic well-being of our children and our children’s children. Instead of passing the torch on to the successor generation of Americans, the Congress is simply passing them the bill. This is the opposite of honorable, and it must stop.\n\nBack to the Land of Milk and Honey\n\nNow, lest you think I am just another central bank sourpuss, I should tell you that I am actually encouraged that the public—from the Tea Party to the unemployed and disaffected who have taken to the streets—is forcing the politicians to focus on the dire need to get their act together. Indeed, I refuse to yield to pessimism, even as it becomes fashionable to do so. I am the child of immigrants. My parents came to this country because there was no limit to upward mobility; they came to the United States because it was the land of milk and honey. It still is. We just have to re-create a fiscal and regulatory environment that—in conjunction with the Fed conducting prudent monetary policy—will liberate the forces of entrepreneurial risk taking that have always been America’s hallmark. Only then will we get back to generating the jobs and the prosperity for all of our people, not just for financial sharpies. Only then will we restore faith in the prospect of upward mobility for all, not just the few.\n\nAs to the immediate economic outlook, there are a plethora of risks above and beyond the possibility that our politicians will fail to do what is right. They range from possible trip wires that might spring from the fiscal fiasco among the 17 countries in the euro zone to the tempering of growth in many of the emerging markets we sell into. These risks could be the subject of an entire speech. But in surveying that landscape and the risks therein, let me simply say that in the parlance of A.A. Milne, I am certainly no “Tigger” when it comes to my outlook for the economy. Neither am I an “Eeyore.”\n\nAt present, we are slowly healing from the financial crisis and great panic of 2008 and 2009. I expect the healing process to continue and gather momentum over time. I think we will see that growth in the third quarter was substantially greater than what we saw in the second quarter. Absent some shock, I envision a slow but steady improvement in the economy into 2012. That is, if our fiscal authorities will remove their stranglehold on clarifying fiscal initiatives. If not, then, in my view, I expect job creators will remain in a defensive crouch and all bets are off.\n\nRecalling Gov. Dewey\n\nI realize that my view is not presently the conventional one. During the Q&A that followed a speech of mine abroad—in New York—a questioner cited the sickly economic pace of the first half of the year and then recited the consensus view that very weak growth will likely ensue for the rest of the year and beyond, seemingly to eternity. In response, I cautioned that forecasting based on current trends can be very misleading. And the consensus view—usually conveyed with confidence all the way out to three places to the right of the decimal point—is almost always wrong, even within the shortest of time periods.\n\nI asked my interlocutor to recall the presidential election of 1948. The consensus view called for a landslide victory by Gov. Thomas E. Dewey. Indeed, an early edition of the Chicago Tribune on the very night of the election announced in the boldest of headlines that Dewey had won. Before going to sleep, an overconfident Dewey is reported to have turned to his wife and said, “Just think about it, darling: Tomorrow night, you are going to be sleeping with the president of the United States!”\n\nThe next morning at breakfast, Mrs. Dewey asked, “Am I going up to Washington this evening or is Harry Truman coming to our house?”\n\nThank you, Mark. That was something of a Ted Straussian travelogue, and I thank you for your patience in letting me cover a broad landscape. In the few minutes we have left, I would be happy to avoid answering any and all questions you might have.",

            "content": "October 7, 2011 Dallas, Texas\n\nThank you, Cheryl [Bridges] for that kind introduction. Carl Sewell called me some months ago and invited me here today. Carl and I are the closest of friends. And our two sons, “Little Carl,” as I affectionately call him, and my son Miles are also best buddies. No one on the planet is better at making a sale than Papa Carl and Little Carl, so this is why you are stuck with me as your morning speaker.\n\nThis morning I would like to provide an overview of the national economy and inflation as we see it from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Before doing so, however, allow me to demystify the Federal Reserve System and the Dallas Fed’s role within that System.\n\nFederal Reserve Functions\n\nIf you look closely at the face of any $1 note, you will see a letter in the middle of the left side. Every $1 bill bears the imprint of one of the Federal Reserve Banks, starting with the “A” of the Boston Fed and ending with the “L” of the San Francisco Fed. Dallas Fed dollars are identified by the letter “K,” surrounded by two concentric circles. The outer circle says “Federal Reserve” and “Texas,” and the inner circle says “Bank of” and “Dallas.” “K” is the 11th letter in the alphabet—the number “11” is printed in all four corners of the bill. The Dallas Fed is responsible for the administration of the Federal Reserve’s affairs in the 11th of 12 districts that were set up by Congress under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. Presently, there are nearly $1 trillion worth of Federal Reserve notes in circulation. (Of course, you know that the Eleventh District’s dollars—what I call “Texas Dollars”—are of greater nominal value than the others!)\n\nThe economic activity conducted within the Eleventh District—which includes roughly 27 million people and covers some 360,000 square miles in southern New Mexico, Texas and the wooded north of Louisiana—is serviced by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and its three branches.\n\nI am the president and CEO of a $110 billion bank. That bank operates at a profit—a profit that we send to the Treasury. Indeed, the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, collectively, transferred over $125 billion to the Treasury in 2009 and 2010. You are looking at an individual affiliated with one of the few public agencies that actually pay down the federal deficit.\n\nWhat do we do for those 27 million people in the Eleventh District? For starters, we make sure they have the cash they need. In the second quarter of this year, the Dallas Fed distributed and received almost 2.9 billion circulating banknotes, worth over $53 billion at face value. Our mammoth machines scan the cash at an average rate around 100,000 bills per hour and process them so they can be shipped from our vaults in El Paso, Houston and Dallas to banks throughout our district, providing you and your customers with folding money. Of course, in addition to making sure there is a sufficient amount in circulation, we have to make sure your folding money is valid and looks respectable: Each month, we pluck out about 35 million worn bills that have lived a full life and are ready to be shredded, sent off to money heaven and replaced by new, crisp notes.\n\nBeginning this year, the Dallas Fed stopped processing checks. (In 2009, we processed 120 million paper checks.) Since the use of paper checks has been, and will continue to be, on a substantial decline as consumers and businesses take up their electronic counterparts, the Federal Reserve Board decided to consolidate all paper-check processing at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. (After the loss of LeBron James, losing paper-check processing would have been too much for the city to handle.)\n\nAnother important function of the Dallas Fed is to provide liquidity to district depository institutions through our discount window operations—in other words, to be the ultimate banker’s bank. Those of you in this room who are at all affiliated with depository institutions are certainly aware of this vital function. The lending programs that make up our discount window help relieve liquidity strains by providing short-term funding, which is fully secured and collateralized, to depository institutions to help them conduct uninterrupted business on behalf of you and their other customers. Activity levels at the discount window vary with changes in the economic environment. For example, in 2009, during a time of duress, the Dallas Fed made 594 loans approximating $30 billion. In 2010, after Texas had come out of recession, we made only 156 loans for about $3 billion. I chair our credit committee and personally review the loans we make every evening.\n\nAmong our other responsibilities is supervising the banking industry within our district. Currently, we supervise 37 “state member” banks and 523 bank holding companies. Last June—thanks to the Dodd–Frank Act—we took on the responsibility of supervising savings-and-loan holding companies. We currently have 23 of them in our district.\n\nThis supervisory role is important. I began my private-sector career at the bank of Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., where my superiors instilled in me one overarching principle: Know your customer. We at the Fed rely upon our regulatory relationship to better know our customers, actively monitoring our constituents’ needs and services on the front line of the commercial banking industry and using this insight to be better lenders to all our customers. Without that supervisory and regulatory responsibility, we could not operate effectively as the nation’s lender of last resort. Moreover, the knowledge gained through banking supervision aids the formation of monetary policy.\n\nThe Dallas Fed also organizes public education programs designed to raise financial and economic literacy in our community. We frequently host public events and conferences on significant issues within our economy. Not unimportantly, we work with universities and high schools throughout our district.\n\nCurrency processing, lending as a banker’s bank, banking supervision and public education efforts are integral parts of the Federal Reserve’s job. But you wouldn’t know it if you read the papers: They are not the parts of central banking that usually garner the most public attention. The sexier bits of what I do—to the extent anything in central banking is considered “sexy”—deal with monetary policy.\n\nThe presidents of the 12 Fed Banks, in addition to the five governors of the Federal Reserve Board (two shy of normal, thanks to holdups in the nomination and confirmation process by the Senate), normally meet every six weeks to discuss the current trajectory of the economy and craft the appropriate policy response. We do so in a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, commonly known as the FOMC. It is in these meetings that we set the base interest rate for interbank lending known as the federal funds, or “fed funds,” rate and where we develop other monetary policy initiatives, like the various programs we put in place to restore liquidity in the commercial paper, mortgage and other markets during the recent financial crisis. Our more recent initiatives are commonly known as “QE2” and “Operation Twist.”\n\nI come to each FOMC meeting armed with input from a research team that provides the intellectual heft for informed monetary policy making, as well as insights provided by Dallas Fed board members—including Chairman Herb Kelleher of Southwest Airlines and Mike Ullman of J.C. Penney—by businesses that populate my district and by a group of CEOs from around the nation with whom I constantly consult. The Dallas Fed employs a crack team of economists and analysts who study the local, national and international economies. Their work is top-notch. Few of you might know, for example, that Finn Kydland, an adviser to our research team in Dallas for the past 15 years, won the Nobel Prize in economics in 2004 (and despite that, offers sensible advice).\n\nThe FOMC is one of the few public service decisionmaking bodies in the country whose members can come together and, in the span of only a few hours, present their positions without fear of political retribution and without posturing for the cameras, then hammer out agreement on a course of action based solely on what they solemnly consider judicious for the long-term health of the economy rather than for political convenience. On the afternoon in which we conclude our discussion, we craft a statement for public release explaining the actions taken. We then release a lengthy set of minutes of our deliberations three weeks after our meeting. The minutes of our most recent meeting will be released on Oct. 12. I urge those of you who wish to dig beneath the headlines and better understand the deliberations of the committee, including the views of those like me, who dissented in supporting “Operation Twist,” to pull the minutes off the web. They are only 12 pages long and are readily readable.\n\nThe subject of dissent needs to be placed in context. The president of the United States appoints and the Senate confirms the governors of the Federal Reserve System. The 12 Federal Reserve bankers like me, who sit side by side with those governors, are not subject to that process. We are hired and fired by nine-member boards of directors that represent the financial institutions and stakeholders and economic diversity of our respective districts. I want to make this clear: Like the 11 other Federal Reserve Bank presidents, I am not accountable to any Washington politicians, be they Democrat or Republican. I am politically neutered, devoutly nonpartisan and guided solely by what I believe is the best way to craft policy so as to encourage sustainable economic growth with price stability, regardless of who is in the White House or the Congress. I work hard to represent the views and ideals of my part of the country. My fellow Bank presidents and I represent Main Street, not the Washington or Wall Street establishment. Every time I speak or intervene in our policy discussion at the FOMC—which is quite often (I am, after all, a Texan)—I do so very much with that in mind.\n\nIn keeping with that spirit, there are times when I (and other Bank presidents) take a different view of the cost/benefit analysis of proposed initiatives acceptable to a majority of the committee, judge the costs to outweigh the benefits and respectfully cast a dissenting vote. This is in keeping with the culture of the FOMC. When I was offered the job of running the Dallas Fed by its board, I was asked to come see then Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan. He said, “Richard, one thing is required of you if you accept this job.” I thought: Aha, now I’m going to learn the secrets of the temple. Then he said, “You must always speak to the truth.” And that’s what each member of the FOMC does: We call ’em as we see ’em, whether or not our positions are popular or politically acceptable. At times, we just have an honest difference of opinion, and as Eisenhower once said, “Never confuse honest dissent with disloyal subversion.” Each and every member of the FOMC, hawk or dove, dissenter or validator of the majority, is totally loyal to the mission of the Federal Reserve.\n\nEconomic Overview\n\nSo what is my honest view of the current economic situation?\n\nOverall, the data show that Texas continues to grow at a modest pace. Our data show Texas gained 13,700 jobs in August after adding 29,300 in July, bringing the total number of jobs created here to 171,200.[1] Year to date through August, our fellow Texans have accounted for 20 percent of the nation’s overall net private-sector job creation. (If you calculate Texas’ contribution to job creation by lopping off those states that have continued losing jobs and consider only those that have positive growth in employment, Texas has accounted for 15 percent).\n\nIn order to more effectively gauge the health of our regional economy, I keep a close eye on both the manufacturing and service sectors in our district. Texas accounts for 10 percent of our nation’s manufacturing output. The Dallas Fed conducts the Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey to track this industry, and according to the most recent survey, Texas factory activity increased in September. The production index, a key measure of state manufacturing conditions, rose, suggesting growth picked up last month after stalling in August. Expectations regarding future business conditions, however, were generally less optimistic in September. The index of future general business activity edged down to its first negative reading since April 2009. The index for future company outlook fell as well, staying positive but registering its lowest reading in more than a year. This tells me that considerable uncertainty is hampering the confidence of our manufacturers.\n\nWhile we have good reason to be proud of our manufacturing prowess, the main driver of the Texas economy is the service sector. The service sector accounts for almost 60 percent of private-sector output and employs close to 7 million hardworking Texans. To understand trends in the service sector, we conduct the Texas Service Sector Outlook Survey, covering 230 service-providing firms. According to the most recent survey, Texas service-sector activity increased in September. The revenue index, a key measure of state service-sector conditions, climbed, with one-third of respondents noting that revenue increased from August. Indexes of future service-sector activity remained in positive territory in September. However, expectations regarding future business conditions were mixed. The index of future general business activity remained negative, albeit less so than in our August survey, and the index for future company outlook bounced back into positive territory after posting a negative reading in August.\n\nOf particular interest to this audience, our service-sector survey has a breakout for the retail sector. Retail sales increased in September, according to business executives surveyed, marking two consecutive months of sales growth. Thus, I was not surprised to read this morning that retail sales tracked by Thomson Reuters rose 5.1 percent in September.\n\nIndexes of Texas retail-sector activity remained in positive territory in September, with the exception of part-time employment and hours worked. Expectations regarding broader economic activity improved slightly, although the index of general business activity remained negative.\n\nI should add that we are always looking for ways to improve the accuracy of these surveys. As such, if any of you would be interested in participating in these surveys, please contact me or my staff.\n\nThe bottom line is that the Texas economy continues moving forward, albeit at a slower pace. Nationally, the data are less sanguine. This morning’s payroll report of a gain of 103,000 jobs in September serves only to partially offset the slight gains in the June and August nonfarm payroll reports. The problem remains that we have far too many people out of work and for too long.\n\nPrice Stability\n\nShifting to prices, we continue to see inflationary pressures both at home and abroad, although less so than in the spring. An astute reader of Tuesday’s Wall Street Journal would have noted the article by Ann Zimmerman—who I understand is in the audience today—on page B1.[2] Zimmerman reported that “apparel stores face a double whammy. Many had hoped to raise prices this fall to recoup the cost of cotton, which soared last year and hit historic highs in March before a recent pullback. Now they worry that strapped consumers will resist price increases. If purchases stall, retailers will have to resort to cutting prices instead.”\n\nZimmerman correctly identifies the major issue facing many of the retail contacts nationwide whom I consult before every FOMC meeting. Higher energy and commodity prices have reduced the purchasing power of many American households, many of which continue to suffer from the scourge of unemployment and/or are working to de-lever from over-indebtedness. According to the latest readings, headline inflation increased at an annualized rate of 3 percent in August as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index and 3.75 percent as measured by the Consumer Price Index.\n\nNumbers like these will make any central banker’s heart skip a beat—especially mine. Yet a close look at these numbers will reveal that energy and food prices—notoriously volatile items—make up a significant portion of this increase. This is not to say that these increases are unimportant; clearly they are worrisome, and we are following them closely. But our job as policymakers is to focus on underlying inflationary pressures so as to avoid overemphasizing temporary volatility that might lead to faulty conclusions about the course of the economy.\n\nThe question one should ask is: What is the best method to measure future inflationary trends? Headline inflation, important as it is in measuring the rise in someone’s cost of living, accurately characterizes past inflation but is not as informative as one might think for predicting future inflation. For that—counterintuitive as it might seem—it helps to exclude some of the more volatile components. That is why central bankers around the world pay such close attention to underlying measures rather than the headline number. Underlying price movements are more useful in predicting future inflationary trends.\n\nTo that end, the Dallas Fed has come up with a separate and distinct way of calculating core inflation, called the Trimmed Mean PCE analysis. This measure looks at the price movements of 178 items in the consumer basket through a constantly updated series dating back to 1977. We then strip away both the highest and lowest monthly price increases for categories of goods and services to get at the underlying trend. This trimmed-mean inflation rate has become a key component in my economic toolkit, allowing me to better gauge the direction and speed of approaching inflationary winds.\n\nOver the past six months, trimmed-mean inflation has run at a rate of 2 percent. This suggests that headline inflation will likely gravitate down toward 2 percent, a level that the majority of the FOMC believes is a tolerable target.\n\nThe point is that, as of now, higher input prices have not translated into more sustainable general price inflation numbers. We know from anecdotal soundings like Ann’s that American businesses, including retailers, are doing their utmost to offset with higher prices what have been the surging costs of inputs. The issue, which remains unresolved, is whether or not consumers have the wherewithal to take on these price increases. The dubious outlook for employment raises doubts about businesses' pricing power.\n\nOur job as central bankers is to keep broader inflation at bay. I remain on constant watch for signs of inflationary impulses. But, presently, I believe the most urgent issue is creating jobs and reducing unemployment.\n\nIn his testimony before Congress on Tuesday, Chairman (Ben) Bernanke noted that, “Monetary policy can be a powerful tool, but it is not a panacea for the problems currently faced by the U.S. economy. Fostering healthy growth and job creation is a shared responsibility of all economic policymakers, in close cooperation with the private sector. Fiscal policy is of critical importance … a wide range of other policies—pertaining to labor markets, housing, trade, taxation, and regulation, for example—also have important roles to play.”[3]\n\nI have argued this for a couple of years, so I obviously concur with Chairman Bernanke.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has done a great deal to reverse the financial and economic crisis we confronted in 2008 and 2009. We have filled the gas tanks of the economy with affordable liquidity. What is needed now is for employers to confidently step on the pedal and engage the transmission that will use that fuel to move the great job-creating machine of America forward. If I believed further accommodation or fiddling with the yield curve would do the trick and ignite sustainable aggregate demand, I would support it. But the bar for such action remains very high for me until the fiscal authorities do their job by reducing the fiscal and regulatory uncertainty that is holding our mighty economy back.\n\nCheryl, I think I have said enough. So I will end on that, and now do my best to avoid answering any questions you might have.\n\nThank you so much.",

            "content": "October 6, 201 Dallas, Texas\n\nThank you, Mike [Rosa] for that kind introduction. It is an honor to speak at the Texas Economic Development Council’s 2011 annual conference.\n\nLet me first congratulate you on your historic 50th anniversary. From advocating pro-business policies that attract investment and jobs to Texas, to educating our state’s public officials on tax and regulatory matters, this organization has done much to promote and support the economic growth of Texas. So thank you for making my job much easier.\n\nThere are few subjects I enjoy speaking about more than the Texas economy. For reasons well known to all of you, Texas’ record of economic growth and job creation provides an oasis in a national economic desert devoid of life-giving job creation. This record has become a subject of intense interest to the national media. Indeed, my staff and I at the Dallas Fed have been deluged with requests for data on all aspects of the Texas economy.\n\nToday I will attempt to separate fact from fiction, with a heavy focus on the data. In particular, I will take both a short- and long-term view of the Texas economy and wrap-up with some of the challenges facing our state as we go forward.\n\nFederal Reserve Functions\n\n\n\nBefore I dive into these weighty matters, I think it best to provide some background on the Fed so you’ll understand where I am coming from. If you look closely at the face of any $1 note, you will see a letter in the middle of the left side. Every $1 bill bears the imprint of one of the Federal Reserve Banks, starting with the “A” of the Boston Fed and ending with the “L” of the San Francisco Fed. On the screen behind me you will see that this bill has the letter “K” printed on its face and four “11s” printed near each corner. The Dallas Fed is the 11th Federal Reserve District out of 12 operating across the country. K is the 11th letter in the alphabet. There are two concentric circles around this letter K. The outermost says “Federal Reserve” and “Texas.” The innermost circle says “Bank of” and “Dallas.” I like to chide my colleagues that not all dollar bills are equal. I tell them those with the letter K on them—what I call “Texas dollars”—are worth more than all the rest because they represent the nation’s most dynamic economic machine.\n\nThe 12 Federal Reserve Banks were set up by federal law in 1913. I am president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, which, together with our branches in Houston, San Antonio and El Paso, handles the business of the Fed in this part of the country. We are responsible for ordering and distributing paper money according to the needs of our district, supervising and regulating banks, lending money against good collateral to all banks in our district for their operating needs—whether we supervise them or not, handling payments (for a fee) for the U.S. Treasury, doing economic studies, educating the public on basic financial matters and helping determine the nation’s monetary policy at meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nAt the FOMC table, I represent the perspectives of some 27 million people who reside in the approximately 360,000 square miles of land that stretches from northern Louisiana to southern New Mexico and produces an economic output that is greater than that of Mexico or Australia and, until recently, exceeded that of India.\n\nThe Dallas Fed makes a profit through its lending and other fee-generating activities: We receive no tax appropriations. After paying a small preferred dividend to the member banks of our district, we turn over our annual profit to the U.S. Treasury. Indeed, the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, collectively, transferred over $125 billion to the Treasury in 2009 and 2010. You are looking at an odd duck: A member of a team within a government agency that doesn’t swallow taxpayer money but, instead, operates with private-sector efficiency and uses its profits to directly pay down the nation’s debt.\n\nAnother thing that makes me an odd duck: I am not accountable to any political authority. Unlike the five members of the Federal Reserve Board (two shy of normal, thanks to a hold-up in the nomination and confirmation process), neither I nor my counterparts who operate the Fed’s business through the 12 Reserve Banks are appointed by the president of the United States or confirmed by the U.S. Senate. I was selected for this job by—and serve at the pleasure of—the nine directors who compose the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank board, all of whom are citizens of the Fed’s Eleventh District. That board, which was chaired by Ray Hunt when I was hired, has been chaired by Jim Hackett, CEO of Anadarko Petroleum, and currently is led by Herb Kelleher, founder of Southwest Airlines. The board consists of eight others who hail from Dallas, Houston, Plano, Brady, Huntsville, Fort Worth and Alamogordo, N.M. The Dallas Fed is a Main Street operation.\n\nWhen I was sworn into office, I checked all politics and partisanship at the door. I am neither an “R” nor a “D”; I am politically indifferent. When I took this job, Alan Greenspan told me I had only one obligation, which in his words was “to speak to the truth.” I do my best to speak the straight skinny, informed by the work of the staff of the Dallas Fed, the input I receive from the bankers and businesses and citizens of my district, and my own career as a banker, an investor, a trade negotiator and a man smart enough to come to Texas 37 years ago.\n\nThe Texas Economy\n\nSo what is the straight skinny about the Texas economy?\n\nThe Texas economy has a long tradition of outperforming the nation—a tradition matched only by our long-standing reputation for modesty. From December 1967 through December 2007—the most recent employment peak according to the National Bureau of Economic Research—long-run nonfarm job growth in Texas exceeded that of the nation by 1.1 percentage points.\n\nOver the past 20 years, employment has grown at a compound annual growth rate of about 1.9 percent and our economic output has expanded at a 3.6 percent annual rate. On the screen is what we call a “spaghetti chart”—it charts employment growth in the Eleventh District economy (the bulk of which is Texas) relative to other Fed districts for the past 20 years. This graph says it all: We have consistently outperformed the rest of the nation in growing economic prosperity.\n\n\n\nWe continued that performance over the past three especially difficult years. Texas was last into the recent frightful recession and one of the strongest coming out. In 2008, the nadir of the downturn, we were still creating jobs here. In fact, while the U.S. lost 3.1 million jobs, Texas added 45,000 private-sector jobs in 2008. But stout as we are, we caught the recessionary flu at the onset of the fall of 2008, with the result that we lost 362,000 jobs in 2009. We recovered quickly and at a faster pace than the rest of the nation. We added jobs in 2010, and we have continued to add jobs in 2011. So far this year, we have added 171,200 jobs (including 13,700 jobs in August) and grown at an annual pace of 2.5 percent—more than twice the national average of 1 percent.[1]\n\nIn fact, the only other states that are back to or have punched through their previous peak employment levels are Alaska and North Dakota, which, combined, have a population of 1.4 million good citizens. As of August, the Texas unemployment rate stood at 8.5 percent. To be sure, this is lower than the national average of 9.1 percent. But while our recovery has outpaced that of the nation thus far, unemployment remains stubbornly high and too many Texans are out of work. A big part of your job as economic development professionals is to help craft the incentives for business to invest and create jobs here and drive down that rate of unemployment.[2]\n\nA quick plug: As fellow Texans who are interested in the economic development of our great state, I encourage you to visit our website (www.dallasfed.org) for factual, nonpoliticized briefs on the Texas economy. There you will find a plethora of economic briefings and economic data, including the job-creation figures that get bandied about in debates among presidential aspirants. At a minimum, I am hopeful our web postings will help you separate spin from reality and fact from fiction, as well as dispel some of the stereotypes of Texas.\n\nEconomic Prognostications\n\nI expect that during the Q&A, you might ask me for a forecast for Texas’ economic growth going forward. Let me head that off at the pass. I am wary of precise economic forecasts. Economics is more an art form than a science, despite claims to the contrary. As such, economic prognostications need to be taken with a grain of salt, even when delivered by Federal Reserve officials, for they are seldom accurate and are subject to constant revisions. One of my professors in college used to say that “the only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable.”\n\nSo let me just say—as a Piscean—that our Texas economy continues to face significant headwinds, including uncertainty that derives from the indecision or sometimes counterproductive decisions of the national government. And we will continue to be handicapped by low levels of construction activity, reduced state and local government spending and still moderate gains in consumer spending and demand. Despite these conditions, I expect Texas job growth to continue increasing at a moderate pace, but only if we can preserve the image and reality of Texas’ uniqueness as a place to do business and grow profits. Profit-making enterprises create jobs. We have too many unemployed workers. We need to attract businesses to come here and grow here. To do so, we have to press our comparative advantage relative to other states.\n\nComparative Advantage\n\nSo what is our comparative advantage?\n\nAs I see it, the key to Texas’ success lies in our ability to change to a rapidly globalized and competitive economic landscape. Texas’ transition from a resource-based economy built on cattle, cotton and oil to a knowledge-based economy built on human capital and innovation is our greatest success. We have made a fine transition “from cow chips to computer chips” and “from boots to suits.” Texas has mastered the art of what the iconic economist, Joseph Schumpeter, called “creative destruction.” We don’t linger long on the old, and we are quick to usher in the new.\n\nIn the 1930 census, for example, agriculture represented 39 percent of all jobs in the state; today, it is less than 2 percent. Despite this decrease, we continue to be one of the top agriculture-producing states in the nation. We are currently No. 1 in ranching and No. 2 in terms of crop production.\n\nIn 1981, oil and gas extraction made up 18 percent of the state’s output. After the oil bust, we diversified our economy and that share dropped significantly. That said, we are certainly blessed with abundant natural resources here, and we most definitely benefit on net from high commodity prices. Currently, oil and gas extraction contributes about 9.5 percent to state output and employs about 2 percent of our workforce.\n\nIn 1970, 15 percent of Texas jobs were in manufacturing. Presently, manufacturing accounts for only 7 percent of our employment, though output in manufacturing has fallen much less, from 18 percent to 15 percent. These sectors saw a decline in job share not due to the demise of industry, but rather because productivity growth has allowed technology to do more of the work. This has allowed labor to shift to other areas of the economy that are in high demand as our population has become wealthier. These include health care, education, finance, professional business services and leisure services.\n\nA key source of Texas’ growth in manufacturing and services has been technology. A recent Milken Institute study on high-tech centers across the U.S. concludes that Texas has three of the top 25 high-tech centers in the country—Dallas, Houston and Austin.[3] Another study by the Milken Institute ranked Texas ninth in its Technology Concentration and Dynamism Composite Index, which measures “the stock of capable entrepreneurs and risk capital available to support the conversion of research into commercially viable technology products and services.”[4]\n\nThe key factors that have contributed to our ability to grow and adapt to the changing landscape are low tax and regulatory burdens, flexible labor markets, open land availability, the success of tort reform, great seaports, airports and transportation and communication infrastructure, and, simply put, the fact that people come here to work and better themselves. All these factors have contributed to a low cost of living and have made doing business in Texas much easier.\n\nBusinesses sell to national and international markets and must compete with producers throughout the world. As a result, they seek areas of production where nominal wages are low for a given level of worker productivity. What matters to workers, however, is their real wages—what they can buy for an honest day’s work. A worker can move from the Silicon Valley or Boston to Dallas or Austin (or Fort Worth or Houston or San Antonio or El Paso), and both the company and the worker are better off. The company can pay him, say, 15 percent less, and yet the worker, who spends a significantly smaller amount for the same home he had in Silicon Valley or Boston, is taxed at lower rates, finds the cost of living cheaper and sees his real income increase by a significant amount. This is what I call the “pull factor,” and it has been a key component of the net immigration of workers and job-creating businesses to the state of Texas.\n\nData from the 2010 census show that net domestic immigration to Texas has been positive every year for the past 19 years. In just the past five years, net migration from other U.S. states (not including international migration) has totaled about 690,000 individuals—equivalent to about 40 percent of the population of the Austin–Round Rock metropolitan statistical area. Positive net migration from other states is a key indicator that we are, in fact, exceptional. People do vote with their feet. They are moving to Texas from other states and from abroad because we offer them something better than they had before.[5]\n\nThis has not gone unnoticed. A recent report published by the Brookings Institution in Washington ranked Austin as the No. 1 city in the U.S. and No. 26 in the world in terms of jobs and income growth during the current economic recovery.[6] The Brookings explanation for Austin’s (and Texas’) success: “continued attraction and retention of high-skilled human capital, its diverse set of export-based industries, and its avoidance of the worst U.S. housing market excesses.” This same study ranked Dallas fourth in the U.S. and 39th in the world in terms of the strength of the recovery. San Antonio ranked 11th and 51st, respectively, while Houston ranked 15th and 61st. As to how others held up during the recession itself, Brookings cited San Antonio as the most “recession-proof” city in the United States.\n\nIn case you are looking for further evidence, the Lone Star State also dominated the Milken Institute’s 2010 Best-Performing Cities index.[7] According to this report, Texas “metros occupied 11 of the top 25 positions among the 200 largest metros in the country and five of the top 10.” It goes on to note that, “Another way to highlight Texas’ dominance is that just two of the state’s 13 metros didn’t make the top 25.” The institute’s reason for Texas’ outperformance—“Texas metros have benefited from a low reliance on durable goods manufacturing, a low cost of doing business, a favorable business climate, the benefits of BRAC [Defense Base Realignment and Consolidation] activities, greater reliance on trade with Mexico and South America … and ongoing energy exploration activities and alternative fuels research.”\n\nVulnerabilities\n\nThere is a lot of room for Texas brag when we talk about our economy and our potential. But we also have vulnerabilities that keep Texas from reaching its full potential. In the latest rankings on the competitiveness of states, the Beacon Hill Institute gave mixed results to Texas. The “good news,” according to the institute, is that Texas scores high on overall tax burden, employment in high-tech industries, venture capital, initial public offerings, low unionization, unrestrictive minimum wages, exports, foreign direct investment and percent of population born abroad who come to work. The bad news: Texas ranks near the bottom in most human capital measures. Texas is dead last in the percent of the adult population that graduated from high school, 37th in percent of population enrolled in degree-granting institutions, 35th in academic R&D and 41st in science and engineering degrees awarded.[8]\n\nWhen you get a chance, take a look at the membership list for the Association of American Universities (AAU), which is regarded by most scholars as the definition of the cream of the crop of research universities. The AAU consists of 59 U.S. (and two Canadian) universities. These 59 U.S. schools garner over 50 percent of all federal R&D dollars to colleges and universities; they are home to 87 percent of all elected members of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine—the highest recognition in each of those fields. Since 1901, 35 percent of all Nobel Prizes have gone to individuals affiliated with AAU universities.[9]\n\nCalifornia has nine AAU members. The New York area also has nine. And Texas? We have three: Rice, UT–Austin and Texas A&M.\n\nAnother source that underscores the Achilles’ heel of Texas’ economy is U.S. News & World Report. According to its assessment, Massachusetts has 10 schools ranked in the top 100 universities. The New York area has 11 and California has 13. We have only six: Rice, ranked 17th, UT–Austin (45th), Texas A&M (58th), SMU (62nd), Baylor (75th) and TCU (97th).[10] I admire the Rice Owls, but I am embarrassed by having them as the sole university in the nation’s top 20. You should be, too. We ought to have several.\n\nYou can’t be happy with the fact that we are falling behind in all aspects of education, from kindergarten right up to the university level. Think about it. We know that incomes and net worth are directly correlated to educational attainment. We know that in the Knowledge Age in which we live, the mind is the capital plant of the modern economy. We all admire those who work with their muscles and by the sweat of their brow in pulling prosperity from the soil on our farms and ranches, or from deep beneath the earth in our mighty oil and gas sector. We rightly applaud those who help Texas produce almost 10 percent of the nation’s manufactured goods. But the world of today and tomorrow is driven by digits, not widgets. We will continue to move up the value-added ladder and stay ahead of the competition—not just from other states, but from China and the new emerging powers—only if we are able to nurture and harness Texas brains.\n\nWe must not lose track of this simple, unalterable, indisputable, critical fact: We have done well so far; our economy is mighty. But to stay ahead of the curve and compete in tomorrow’s global marketplace, Texas must better educate its population.\n\nMy plea is that each of you makes it one of your principal goals to make Texas an educational powerhouse. High-value-added, job-creating businesses that are world beaters will not move their top executives to Texas unless they can send their children and grandchildren to top schools and universities.\n\nWhatever our ethnicity or origin, Texans are a race of risk takers. We have from the very start defied conventional wisdom. We must now take risks, defy conventional wisdom and turn around our education system. Our economic future depends upon it.\n\nLone Star\n\nIf you’re looking for motivation to do what most others consider unthinkable, dust off T.R. Fehrenbach’s history of Texas, titled Lone Star.[11] It’s a long book—some 719 pages. But it is most readable and is, to my mind, perhaps the finest history of Texas ever written, though it has now been over 40 years since it was first printed.\n\nFor example, Fehrenbach walks his readers through how Mirabeau B. Lamar moved the capital to Austin in 1840. Then, only 900 people lived there on the border of Comanche country, facing a wild, frightful, untamed western frontier. Yet, here we are today, as I mentioned, with one of the most elite think tanks in the country concluding that Austin is the highest ranked of all American cities in this recovery and ranked internationally, incidentally, just below Säo Paulo and above Montreal. Little old Austin, ranked right up there with two of the best-known cities in the world. Who would have thought that possible?\n\nWho would have dared think that in the blink of history’s eye, Texas would be outproducing Mexico or Australia and giving the more than 1 billion people of India a run for their money? Fehrenbach recites how great men and establishment figures of the time like John Quincy Adams scoffed at Houston and Lamar and at Texas. Too bad they aren’t around now to see what those early Texans and their successors set in train.\n\nWhat has been accomplished here could only have been made possible by a people who understand that it pays to respect the “animal spirits” that drive the entrepreneurialism and risk taking that push the economic frontier both literally and figuratively. As Fehrenbach puts it: “The Texan ethic and Texas society rewarded enterprise … work was the real virtue.”  “We chose this land; we took it; we made it bear fruit.” We are a people for whom “the cult of courage was obvious.”\n\nFehrenbach distills the Texas spirit into one simple sentence: “Men who exist get overrun by men who act.”\n\nNow, if you were from a part of the United States where the past is more glorious than the future and you were listening to what I have said today, you would at this point of the speech likely be thinking this all sounds like something that rhymes with “bull wit.” But we who live here know this place and its spirit.\n\nConsider yourselves the trustees of the future of our children’s generation and all that come after it. You hold the future of this unique franchise we call Texas in your hands. Your job is to keep Texas exceptional—to create the conditions that safeguard and nourish our prosperity and that of our children and our children’s children. If you do, I have no doubt we will continue to outshine the rest of the nation for another 50 years.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "September 27, 2011 Dallas, Texas\n\nThank you, Anne [Motsenbocker]. I was privileged to have been a member of the Dallas Assembly before I aged into being “mature.” Being here today with you young folks brings back very fond memories and is wonderfully energizing. Thank you for inviting me to lunch today.\n\nJan Mayen Island\n\nI am going to start by taking you far away from Dallas, near the Arctic Circle, where, were you to visit Jan Mayen Island, you would see this sign:\n\n\n\nJan Mayen is a desolate volcanic island located about 600 miles west of Norway’s North Cape. It is the home of a meteorological and communications station manned in the harshest of winters by 17 hearty members of the Norwegian Armed Forces. If you read Tom Clancy’s Hunt for Red October, you would know it as “Loran-C,” a NATO tracking and transmissions station. In the video game Tomb Raider: Underworld, Lara Croft visits Jan Mayen in search of Thor’s Hammer, considered the most awesome of weapons in Norse mythology, capable of leveling mountains and performing the most heroic feats.\n\nMy brother Mike recently visited this station on Jan Mayen. This is the sign that greeted him.\n\nIn norsk, it reads as follows:\n\n“Theory is when you understand everything, but nothing works.”\n\n“Practice is when everything works, but nobody understands why.”\n\n“At this station, theory and practice are united, so nothing works and nobody understands why.”\n\nMy wry brother implied that this about summed it up for monetary policy. Drawing on theory and practice, the 17 members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) have been working in the harshest economic environment to harness monetary theory and lessons learned from practice to revive the economy and job creation without forsaking our commitment to maintaining price stability. But the committee’s policy has yet to show evidence of working and nobody seems to quite understand why.\n\nToday, I am going to quickly summarize the action taken by the FOMC at our meeting last week. I am going to explain at greater length why I dissented from the consensus of the committee, incorporating why I believe the monetary accommodation we have thus far implemented has failed to deliver.\n\nI remind you that conducting monetary policy in today’s economy is not for the faint of heart. All 17 of us who have the privilege of serving on the FOMC are working toward the same end. We devote ourselves to crafting the right monetary policy for the nation. When we meet, each of us lays out our arguments calmly, with great respect for each other and without acrimony—an approach that is sadly rare elsewhere in government. As I represent the Dallas Fed at the FOMC table, I want you and others to know what my views are so that you might have a better understanding of the difficult trade-offs involved in our decisionmaking.\n\nLast Week’s FOMC Meeting\n\nAfter meeting for two days last week, the committee announced that its outlook for the economy was less sanguine than it had previously anticipated. It foresaw “significant downside risks to the economic outlook, including strains in global financial markets.” Realizing that resolution of the European situation depends on European authorities, we focused on policy alternatives that might bolster the U.S. economy. The committee decided that it would “purchase, by the end of June 2012, $400 billion of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 years to 30 years and ... sell an equal amount of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 3 years or less. This program,” the committee stated, “should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and help make broader financial conditions more accommodative.” In addition, the FOMC also reaffirmed the expectation it expressed at the August meeting, “that economic conditions … are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate”—the interest rate we set for overnight interbank lending—“at least through mid-2013.”\n\nConcurrently, the committee decided it would depart from its previous decision to invest the proceeds from the roll-offs from its substantial portfolio of mortgage-backed and agency—Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac—securities into Treasuries and would instead “reinvest principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities.”[1]\n\nIn the interest of time, I will not dwell on the decision to reinvest proceeds in the agency and mortgage-backed markets. Since the beginning of this year, the spreads between mortgage-backs and Treasuries have been widening and have accelerated, especially lately, to levels last seen in early 2009. This decision, while not expected by the markets, was acceptable for me as a tactical way to provide limited assistance to the mortgage market at little cost. The decision to embark on an “Operation Twist,” however, was a strategic decision where I did not feel the benefits outweighed what I perceived to be the costs. So, I will dwell on that difficult decision.\n\nThe Rationale Behind Operation Twist\n\nAs the minutes of last week’s meeting will not be released until Oct. 12, it would be inappropriate for me to provide you a fulsome recital of the discussion that took place at the table. When you do read the minutes, however, it might help to recall a little history.\n\nThe original Operation Twist was announced by President Kennedy on Feb. 2, 1961. It was actually the idea of my mentor, Robert Roosa, who later hired me out of Stanford Business School in 1975 to be his assistant, following in the footsteps of other “Roosa Boys”—the first of whom was a fellow named Paul Volcker. In the original Operation Twist, the Federal Reserve sold a portion of the short-term Treasuries held in its System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio and invested the proceeds in longer-dated Treasuries. The goal was to decrease long-term rates and increase investment, while increasing short-term rates so as to prop up the dollar.\n\nThe purpose of Operation Twist II is similar: The FOMC seeks to drive down the cost of capital for businesses in order to induce them to invest more in expansion and create more jobs. Implicitly, the program may also lift short-term rates, albeit mildly given the expectation that rates at the short end will remain at “exceptionally low levels” through mid-2013, perhaps providing some relief to money market funds that, in searching for yields sufficient to cover their costs, have been invested in foreign bank paper now considered by many analysts to be somewhat toxic.\n\nAs background to my take on this newer version of Operation Twist, I want to make it crystal clear that I am as eager as anyone on the committee to see greater job creation. It is true that I am an inflation hawk: I believe the foremost duty of any central banker is to ensure price stability. Indeed, I believe that the Fed cannot deliver on its congressionally mandated task of seeking full employment unless it delivers first on its mandated duty of warding off both inflation and deflation.\n\nThe Dallas Fed tracks 178 items in the consumer basket through a constantly updated series dating back to 1977. Using this data, we calculate what we call a “trimmed mean” analysis of personal consumption expenditures (PCE) in order to ascertain the level of inflation affecting real consumers.[2] This is my preferred compass for charting the direction of inflation. It presently suggests that headline inflation will decline from its current level—just shy of 3 percent as measured by the PCE and 3.75 percent as measured by the Consumer Price Index—to 2 percent, a level that the majority of the committee believes a tolerable target. Thus, while I remain on constant watch for signs of inflationary impulses, I believe the most urgent issue is job creation and the reduction of the scourge of unemployment.\n\nI believe, however, that there is significant risk that the policies recently undertaken by the FOMC are likely to prove ineffective and might well be working against job creation.\n\nPrevious Dissents\n\nIn the interest of time, I will neither repeat the reason for my opposition to the round of accommodation known as QE2 nor discuss my dissenting vote in August, when the committee indicated its expectation that rates would remain exceptionally low through mid-2013. I have explained my logic in previous speeches, which are located on our website.[3]\n\nI’ll focus here on Operation Twist and the decisions announced last Wednesday. There is a common theme running through my dissenting views on Operation Twist, QE2 and what has come to be viewed as a commitment by the market that we will hold the fed funds rate “extremely low” for the next two years. My fundamental concern is about the efficacy of these initiatives.\n\nEfficacy Questions\n\nThe efficacy of the original Operation Twist has been vigorously debated through time. Bob Roosa once confided in me that he considered it “too clever by half” and “not (his) brightest brainchild.” Bob’s self-deprecation was recently quantified in a study by Eric Swanson of the San Francisco Fed. Swanson estimated that the impact of the 1961 program resulted in a 15-basis-point reduction—remember, 15 basis points is 15 one-hundredths of 1 percent—in long-term Treasury yields and a 2- to 4-basis-point—2 to 4 one-hundredths of 1 percent—reduction in corporate bond yields.[4] Swanson’s paper follows upon an insightful study by two top economists at Northwestern University who estimated that QE2—the previous round of accommodation—lowered Treasury yields by roughly 20 basis points and investment grade corporate bond yields by about 7 to 12 basis points.[5]\n\nTo nonfinancial market types, this may seem a tad bit esoteric. The point is that the direct benefit of QE2 seemed small relative to the cost, including the complications arising from the expansion of our balance sheet and the stirring of suspicions among our critics that the FOMC is influenced too heavily by the financial interests that make more money from trading than from lending to job-creating businesses.\n\nFor me, Swanson’s study begged questions about the cost/benefit trade-offs of a modern Operation Twist from a theoretical perspective. From a practical perspective, I had other concerns.\n\nBefore every FOMC meeting, I survey a select group of 30 or so private business and banking operators, imparting no information about monetary policy but listening carefully to their perspectives on developments in the economy as seen at the ground level. For weeks leading up to the meeting, there was speculation in the financial markets and in the press that an Operation Twist was being contemplated. I received an earful of opinions on these rumors. What I gleaned from those conversations was as follows:\n\nOne other factor gave me pause and that was, and remains, the moral hazard of being too accommodative. For years, I have been arguing that monetary policy cannot solve the problem of substandard economic performance unless it is complemented by fiscal policy and regulatory reform that encourages the private sector to put to work the affordable and abundant liquidity we are able to create as the nation’s monetary authority. These actions are not within the Fed’s purview; they are the business of Congress and the president. Chairman (Ben) Bernanke said it well in his recent speech at Jackson Hole (Wyo.): “Most of the economic policies that support robust economic growth in the long run are outside the province of the central bank.”[6] Both within the FOMC and in public speeches, I have argued that until our fiscal authorities get their act together, further monetary accommodation—be it in the form of quantitative easing or performing “jujitsu” on the yield curve through efforts such as Operation Twist—will represent nothing more than pushing on a string.\n\nOf course, I am only a single voice at the FOMC table. I presented my views, as did other participants. All views were given a fair hearing. In the end, the decision taken by the FOMC is that of the majority, and the majority supported the initiatives that were announced. We must now hope that they will work.\n\nThe Siren Call of Inflation\n\nI might conclude by sharing my concerns about the prospect of temporarily allowing more inflation as a means of unlocking expansion in final demand.\n\nI understand the theoretical basis for entertaining that thesis: If businesses and consumers believe prices will rise, they will rush out to invest and consume now. But the practical aspects of this approach appear to counter the theoretical.\n\nPaul Volcker, who has the scars on his back from his Herculean effort to rein in inflation in the 1980s, wrote of this in the New York Times on Sept. 18.[7] He reminded us that once unleashed, inflation combines with stagnation to make stagflation, the most painful of all combinations for the poor, for workers, for job seekers, for bond and stock holders and for businesses trying to navigate the economy.\n\nHis words from that article should be engraved on the foreheads of every central banker: “The siren song [of inflation] is both alluring and predictable. … After all, if 1 or 2 percent inflation is O.K. and has not raised inflationary expectations—as the Fed and most central banks believe—why not 3 or 4 or even more? Let’s try to get business to jump the gun and invest now in the expectation of higher prices later … and maybe wages will follow. … Well, good luck. Some mathematical models spawned in academic seminars might support this scenario. But all of our economic history says it won’t work that way. I thought we learned that lesson in the 1970s. … What we know, or should know, from the past is that once inflation becomes anticipated and ingrained—as it eventually would—then the stimulating effects are lost. Once an independent central bank does not simply tolerate a low level of inflation as consistent with ‘stability,’ but invokes inflation as a policy, it becomes difficult to eliminate.”\n\nTo that I say, “Amen.”\n\nThor’s Hammer\n\nI return to where I began—Jan Mayen Island. Paul Volcker understands better than most the limitations of theory and the harsh lessons of practice. I have nowhere near the wisdom or the experience of Volcker. But as the son of a Norwegian mother, I do know a little about Norse mythology. The legend holds that with his hammer in hand, Thor “would be able to strike as firmly as he wanted … and the hammer would never fail … and never fly so far from his hand that it could not find its way back.”[8] Monetary policy is not Thor’s hammer. It is an awesome weapon. But it has limitations. We must carefully harbor its power. If we deploy it incorrectly, we might level more than interest rates and destroy that which we seek to create. And if we let it fly too far from our grasp, we may never get it back. In conducting policy going forward, we must constantly bear this in mind.",

            "content": "September 12, 2011 Dallas, Texas\n\nThank you, Pat [Faubion]. Thank you all for inviting me to speak at this National Association for Business Economics (NABE) annual meeting.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas has long been involved with NABE. Our director of research and my trusted senior policy advisor, Harvey Rosenblum, is a former NABE president (2001–02). Another of my policy advisors, Tom Siems, is a two-time winner of NABE’s Edmund A. Mennis Contributed Paper Award. And Ken Rogoff, winner of this year’s Adam Smith Award, is a member of the Dallas Fed’s Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute advisory board.\n\nI benefit greatly from the insights of these talented people, as well as those of Mine Yücel and Roberto Coronado, who are also speaking to you at this conference, and one of my mentors, our Dallas Fed board chairman, Herb Kelleher, who entertained you at lunch. Herb may be the only person on the planet who discovered the formula for making a retail business with high fixed costs and intense regulatory oversight not only fly but soar; his insights into how the economy works in practice, as opposed to theory, are invaluable.\n\nI am pleased that Dick Berner, a former NABE president now at Treasury, running the Office of Financial Research, is here. I believe it was Dick who, during a round of golf at Jackson Hole [Wyo.] long ago, told me the bad joke about the fellow who suggested that a moose crossing sign be moved because “there is too much auto traffic where the sign is currently located.”\n\nI also see Bill Dunkelberg, another former NABE president, who has been most generous in sharing with me and my staff his understanding of the whys and wherefores of small business, an important input into the way we look at things at the Dallas Fed.\n\nThere are many others here today whom I would acknowledge if time permitted, but I ask their forbearance so that we can get down to business.\n\nAs learned economists, you are fully aware of the nation’s predicament. Chairman [Ben] Bernanke reviewed it concisely in his speech at Jackson Hole and again, just last week, in Minneapolis. Knowing that most of you read those speeches, my guess is that you are looking to me for two things today. The first, given that you are in Dallas and the nation is in the throes of a presidential election season with two Texas contenders for their party’s nomination, would be the Dallas Fed’s perspective on the much-discussed Texas economy. Second, I’m guessing you are looking for some insight into what the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is going to do next, insight Chairman Bernanke, as leader of our pack, wisely avoided imparting in his recent comments.\n\nThe Texas Economy\n\nOn the Texas front, my colleagues and I at the Dallas Fed have lately been deluged with requests for data on all aspects of the Texas economy—which accounts for 95 percent of the Eleventh District’s output and the economic activity of some 25 million of the 27 million people living in our district. If you are interested, you can go to our website (www.dallasfed.org) to receive a factual, nonpoliticized brief on the Texas economy, including the job creation figures that get bandied about in debates among presidential aspirants. We update these numbers monthly—the data for the August employment figures will be tabulated on our website on Sept. 19—and we will keep updating them so that analysts can parse the data.\n\nAt a minimum, I am hopeful our web postings will help you separate spin from reality and fact from fiction, as well as dispel some of the stereotypes of Texas.\n\nFor example, we are blessed with abundant natural resources here, and we most definitely do benefit on net from high commodity prices; oil and gas extraction contributes about 9.5 percent to state output. Yet, when jobs are tallied, the contribution of oil and gas accounts for only 2 percent of the Texas workforce. Indeed, if you peruse our website, you will see that since the National Bureau of Economic Research proclaimed the recovery’s start in June 2009, education and health services, which employs 13.5 percent of Texas’ workers, and professional and business services, which employs another 12.5 percent, have gained 173,000 jobs during the recovery—nearly 60 percent of all the jobs added in Texas. The Texas workforce consists of more than just roustabouts and cowboys, though we are certainly proud of that heritage. Those of you who are here for the first time have no doubt already noticed this as you have wandered around Dallas and have seen nary an oil rig nor a cow.\n\nWhile you are looking at the research material on our site, you might also look over the Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey, which we refer to by the acronym TMOS. Since 2004, TMOS has had the highest correlation of all Fed bank surveys with the Institute for Supply Management’s national manufacturing index. And you might find of interest our monthly service sector and retail outlook surveys. Mine might brief you on the most recent results of these during your session with her this afternoon.\n\nPolicy Background\n\nEnough about Texas per se. I am, however, going to put up on the screen behind me a slide that bridges developments in the Texas economy and the nation’s economic predicament. I’ll use this to lead into a discussion of the issues facing policymakers as we go forward.\n\n\n\nThis slide was put together for a briefing recently by Harvey Rosenblum. It charts employment by Federal Reserve district from the time job creation peaked in each district until today. A quick explanation to make this easier on the eye: The bottom, or horizontal axis, is the time in months since employment peaked in each district. For example, it has been roughly 54 months since employment peaked in the Atlanta district, which is depicted by the tan bottom line; it has been 36 months since employment peaked in the Dallas district, as shown in the shorter red line at the top. Observing the vertical axis, you can see that the only Fed district that is recovering to employment levels enjoyed at the peak is Dallas. In point of fact, the only other states that are back to or have punched through their previous peak employment levels are Alaska and North Dakota, which, combined, have a population of 1.4 million good citizens. The other 11 Fed districts are hovering at levels approximately 3 to 8 percent below peak employment, while the nation as a whole—the black line—is still 5 percent below the levels that prevailed in 2008.\n\nOf course, in Texas we have a long tradition of outperforming the nation—a tradition matched only by our long-standing reputation for modesty. The 1.1 percentage-point gap we’ve seen between Texas and national job growth over the current recovery corresponds almost exactly to the long-run (40-year) historical gap between our growth rate and the nation’s.\n\nThe shortfall in jobs at the national level is but one indicator of the pervasive anguish of American households since the Panic of 2008. Another sign of that anguish is that average real per capita net worth in the United States has not regained the losses incurred in the latter part of the last decade. At the end of the first quarter of 2011, average per capita net worth was nearly 14 percent below the peak seen four years earlier. Real income has not fared as badly, but per capita salary income is, nevertheless, almost 2 percent below its peak in the first quarter of 2008. A likely widening of income dispersion over the period, however, suggests that median income has probably fared worse. We will get a better read on this when the Federal Reserve Board completes it triennial Survey of Consumer Finances early next year. I do not expect that survey to paint a pretty picture.\n\nI am most aware, as are many of you, that if history is any guide, getting back to where we were will be no small task. The 2008–09 recession was precipitated by a banking crisis. A number of you, including Ken Rogoff, have shown that downturns associated with banking crises tend to be the most severe, and that clawing back lost employment and output in the aftermath of a financial crisis is most vexing. My colleague Mark Wynne, who directs our Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute, has written an excellent brief on this for our Economic Letter publication, which should be posted on our website today.\n\n\n\nThis chart of output relative to precrisis trend summarizes Mark’s conclusion: Since the onset of the financial crisis in 2008, “performance of real GDP in the U.S. is almost exactly in line with what we might have expected based on the average experience of other countries that have gone through banking crises.”[1] This chart is most definitely not a pretty sight.\n\nSmall wonder that American consumers—and the businesses that hire and serve them—remain in a defensive crouch. The question is: How do we change the picture? How do we get the pistons of job creation, income growth and wealth restoration pumping again?\n\nThis is the gist of the discussion at the FOMC table. The press and others delineate the viewpoints around the table on an ornithological scale, dividing us up into doves and hawks. I am classified according to that delineation as a hawk. I am not offended by this, but, not unlike the stereotyping of Texas, I consider it simplistic. We are actually birds of a feather in that we are simply trying to figure out the proper way to conduct monetary policy in order to live up to our dual mandate. Each of us does our utmost to craft monetary policy so as to engender restoration of full employment in the context of price stability.\n\nA word about price stability. At the Dallas Fed, we look at prices through a different lens than others. We are of the strong opinion that Jim Dolmas’ trimmed mean analysis of personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—an analytical survey of 178 items in the consumer basket that we have tracked in a constantly updated series dating to 1977—provides the best insight into prices impacting consumers and the likely path of prices going forward.\n\nThe Dallas Trimmed Mean PCE recorded an annualized rate of 2.4 percent in July, up from a more moderate 1.4 percent in June. Looking over the six-month horizon—which averages out some of the month-to-month wiggles—the trimmed mean is up precisely 2 percent on an annualized basis. Over the same six months, the headline PCE index is up 3.1 percent, owing to sharp increases in the prices of gasoline and, to a lesser but not unimportant extent, food. Barring further surges in those components, we would expect the headline rate to gravitate toward the trimmed mean rate of 2 percent over the coming months. We shall see.\n\nThe point is that while I feel the most important role for a central banker is to maintain price stability—and I am always on watch, hawk-like, on the inflationary front—I share with equal intensity the concern of my FOMC colleagues about the employment picture and the overall fragility of our economy. I am keen on finding ways to close the income and output gaps depicted in these two slides and restore economic momentum. I find the last employment report and the recent Federal Reserve Bank surveys of activity, including the Dallas Fed’s, to be discouraging in this regard.\n\nWhen people are frightened, they understandably look for a “fix.” Yet, my colleagues and I are professionally beholden to beware of short-term fixes that might contradict, or place in jeopardy, the long-term duty and credibility of the central bank. I am wary of adopting any policy that might have the unintended consequence of becoming a veterinary fix rather than a more salutary repairing of the ability to propagate jobs.\n\nIt is no secret that I thought the second round of quantitative easing (QE2) ran that risk. I could not support it when it was proposed because I saw no analytically sound justification that its purported benefits would outweigh its likely costs. Similarly, at our last meeting, I felt that the benefit of stating that the FOMC anticipates economic conditions were likely to warrant holding the base rate at “exceptionally low levels … at least through mid-2013” was outweighed by the risk that such an action would be viewed as a commitment. The majority of the FOMC felt that anchoring the fed funds rate where it is for two years would assure markets and incent business activity. I felt doing so would, instead, give job-creating companies, particularly small- and medium-sized businesses, an incentive to further delay borrowing for expansion, given that they feel stymied both by anemic demand and discomfort with how they are taxed and regulated. It seemed to me that signaling that money would likely remain cheap for two years or more would hardly induce those with access to credit to borrow to expand and add to payrolls now.\n\nThis discomfort was compounded for me by the confusion and disorienting uncertainty arising from the debacle of the debt ceiling negotiations that took place shortly before the FOMC meeting—an uncertainty that has yet to be resolved. Moreover, it struck me that such a stance risked creating a perception that the FOMC might be a little bit trigger-happy in reacting to short-term developments in the securities markets; that we were collectively signaling there was a readily available “Bernanke Put.”\n\nThe press and the Street are currently brimming over with assumptions about new fixes. Market operators are, to varying degrees, pricing in probabilities of one or more of the following: further expansion of our balance sheet; an “Operation Twist,” wherein we lengthen the duration of our portfolio so as to drive down already historically low nominal intermediate and longer-term rates (rates that are below 2 percent all the way through the 10-year range and have negative yields in real terms); reducing from 25 basis points to zero what we pay on excess reserves (though the banks that deposit these reserves with us reportedly aren’t able to identify a sufficient number of willing borrowers or believe they need a cushion to deal with regulatory concerns).\n\nThe Federal Reserve has done a great deal to reverse the situation that we confronted in 2008 and 2009. As I have said repeatedly, we have filled the gas tanks of the economy with affordable liquidity. What is needed now is for employers to confidently step on the pedal and engage the transmission that will use that gas to move the great job-creating machine of America forward.\n\nSources of Uncertainty\n\nThat confidence is not lacking because of U.S. monetary policy. It is, however, my firm opinion that confidence is being significantly undermined by at least two sources of uncertainty.\n\nOne is domestic. It arises from the fiscal and regulatory authorities. Congress and the president must put together a program that will encourage growth in final demand as soon as possible by incentivizing private businesses to do what they do best to make growth in final demand possible: Expand investment, hire workers and go about the business of lifting the income and net worth of the American people. Yet, they must do so without running afoul of the need to reverse the downward spiral of the nation’s finances. To this end, I am encouraged that the president and the Congress are going at it hammer and tong, searching to find the right balance between goosing up the economy short term and reining in the long-term fiscal imbalances that are imperiling our nation’s future.\n\nThe second source of uncertainty has largely emanated from the European debt crisis, which intensified in the spring of 2010. At that time, risk spreads jumped, and both securities prices and confidence retreated. This helped derail the momentum that the economy had built up in late 2009 and early 2010. The sovereign debt crisis has reintensified, as you are all aware, and risk premiums in bond and stock markets are rising once again. Another global factor that undermined the pace of recovery this year, of course, was the disruptive earthquake in Japan and the economic aftershock from this tragedy.\n\nIt is hard for domestic monetary policy to offset such effects, both because they are external in nature and because it is unclear how long they will dampen the U.S. recovery. One thing is for certain: Given the effects of banking crises on economic recoveries and the interconnectedness of financial markets, it is imperative that our European partners resolve their banking issues if we are to sustain a prolonged economic upturn.\n\nThis is not to say that the Federal Reserve has no role to play. Our franchise includes assuring an efficient financial transmission mechanism. For example, everyone acknowledges that small business is the originator of jobs and the incubator of our nation’s prosperity. In addition to wanting to see the whites of the eyes of growing final demand, needing clarity on fiscal policy and wanting regulatory relief, many of the small businesses that Dunk [Bill Dunkelberg] represents—and others that we survey—will need better access to the abundant and cheap liquidity the FOMC has made possible. Small businesses turn to community and regional banks for credit; their credit activity does not move the needle on the dashboards of the megabanks. It is incumbent on the Fed and other bank regulators to reduce the regulatory burdens that are inhibiting—indeed, overwhelming—community bankers whose business it is to lend to creditworthy small businesses. This is a supervisory and regulatory matter, not a matter of general monetary policy. My point is that the Fed needs to examine and perfect the transmission mechanism under its purview just as intensely as it looks at monetary policy per se.\n\nAnd we must be ever-mindful that the central bank cannot carry the load alone, as Chairman Bernanke and others of us have often said. Indeed, there is great danger in any temptation to do so. A recent Economist article aptly summarized my perspective on this as follows: “Above all, there is a moral hazard in central-bank activism. It risks encouraging governments to sit back and let others do the work that they find too difficult themselves.”[2]\n\nIf I believe further accommodation or some jujitsu with the yield curve will do the trick and ignite sustainable aggregate demand, I will support it. But the bar for such action remains very high for me until the fiscal authorities do their job, just as we have done ours. And if they do, further monetary accommodation may not even be necessary.\n\nWith that, I’ll stop. And in the best tradition of central banking, I’d be happy to avoid answering any questions you might have.",

            "content": "August 17, 2011 Midland, Texas\n\nThank you, Kirk [Edwards]. It is great to be here in the cool climes of Midland, Texas.\n\nI appreciate your having walked our friends today through the operations of the Dallas Fed. You know as chairman of our El Paso Branch board that we operate a well-run business as we provide services to the American people that only a central bank can provide, from making sure you have folding money, to lending to our community and regional banks, to supervising and regulating bank and thrift holding companies so as to protect depositors. As president and CEO of the Dallas Fed, I am responsible for a $100 billion bank, accountable to a board of local directors. That board is chaired by Herb Kelleher (you Midlanders will appreciate that Herb’s immediate past predecessors were Jim Hackett, president and CEO of Anadarko Petroleum, and Ray Hunt) and consists of eight other citizens of our district; I am also advised by the private-sector directors of the El Paso, San Antonio and Houston branches of our bank.\n\nI am not appointed by a president of the United States or subject to confirmation by the U.S. Senate. I, along with the 11 other Federal Reserve Bank presidents, operate the business of the Federal Reserve as efficiently as any bank in the private sector. And as Kirk mentioned, we make money for the U.S. taxpayer: We returned over $125 billion to the U.S. Treasury in 2009 and 2010. You are looking at one of the few public servants that make money from its operations, rather than just spending taxpayer money. This wouldn’t be possible without a first-rate staff, led by my chief operating officer, Helen Holcomb, and the other senior officers that Kirk introduced. I love and admire these folks and too rarely get to single them out for public praise. So, please join me in applauding them.\n\nTwo Matters\nAs Kirk has already said much of what I planned to say today about how the Fed works, I would like to address two non-operational matters.\n\nFirst is the record of job creation in Texas. For obvious reasons, this has become a subject of intense interest to the national media; my staff and I are being hounded by the national press corps for data and commentary. Today I will try to separate fact from fiction, with a heavy focus on the data.\n\nThe second matter I wish to address is why I dissented from the consensus at the last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe two would appear to be unrelated, but might well be—though not in a manner that would be readily apparent. I will conclude by trying to connect the two dots.\n\nTexas’ Record of Job Creation\nHere is a chart that displays nonagricultural employment growth by Federal Reserve Districts over the past 21½ years, using the employment levels of 1990 as a base of 100 and tracing job creation through June.\n\n\n\nTo illustrate a point, I am going to separate out three districts: the Second, headquartered at the New York Fed and consisting of New York, southwestern Connecticut, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and a dozen counties in New Jersey; the Eleventh, represented by the Dallas Fed, made up of Texas, the wooded areas of northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico; and the Twelfth, or the San Francisco Fed’s district, which consists of California, eight other states, the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa and Guam. The state of New York produces 72 percent of the economic output of the Second District; Texas accounts for 95 percent of the Eleventh District’s output; and California accounts for 62 percent of the Twelfth District’s output. One might consider this second chart to be an imperfect but reasonable proxy for the employment growth over the past two decades of the three largest states in the country.\n\n\n\nLike the chart for employment in all 12 of the Fed’s districts, the three districts’ employment levels are indexed to 100 in 1990. You will see that, at the end of June, the index stands at 150 for the Eleventh District, 125 for the Twelfth and 103 for the Second. Nonagricultural employment growth in Texas has compounded at an annual rate of 1.95 percent over 21½ years; that of California at 0.57 percent; and New York’s at 0.19 percent. If you are interested in the output of their workers over this same period, the compound annual growth rate of Texas GDP is 3.6 percent; California’s is 2.59 percent; and New York’s 2.06 percent.\n\nNow, let’s look at job creation in Texas since June 2009, the date that the National Bureau of Economic Research (or NBER, the body that “officially” dates when a recession starts and ends) declared the recent economic recession to have ended.\n\nThere are several ways to calculate Texas’ contribution to national job creation from June 2009 through the end of June 2011. One is to look at the number of jobs created by all 50 states, including those that have lost jobs since the nation’s anemic recovery began. Using this metric, through June of this year Texas has accounted for 49.9 percent of net new jobs created in the United States.\n\nAnother way to calculate Texas’ contribution to job creation is to lop off those states that have continued losing jobs and consider only those that have positive growth in employment these past two years. Using this metric, Texas has accounted for 29.2 percent of job creation since the recession ended.\n\nThese are the facts. You may select whichever metric you wish. Regardless, it is reasonable to assume Texas has accounted for a significant amount of the nation’s employment growth both over the past 20 years and since the recession officially ended.\n\nThis raises the obvious question—what kind of jobs are being created in Texas? Here are two charts that might help you form an opinion.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first provides a breakdown of employment growth by sector since the recession ended, listing each employment sector by its weight in the employment mix of Texas. The most jobs have been created in the educational and health services sector, which accounts for 13.5 percent of Texas’ employment. The second-most jobs have been created in the professional and business services sector, which accounts for 12.5 percent of the Texas workforce. The mining sector, which includes support activities for both mining and oil and gas, employs 2.1 percent (yes, two-point-one percent) of Texas’ workers. In the second chart, you will see that these jobs are not low-paying jobs. The average weekly wage in the education and health services sector is $790; in the professional and business services sector it is $1,117; and in the mining sector, the average weekly wage is $2,271. Together these three sectors account for 68 percent of the jobs that have been created in Texas in the past two years.\n\nI should point out that in 2010, 9.5 percent of hourly workers in Texas earned at or below the federal minimum wage, a share that exceeds the national average of 6 percent. California’s share was 2 percent and New York’s was 6.5 percent. Texas and New York do not have a state minimum wage that is higher than the federal minimum wage.[1] At least 17 states do have minimum wages that are above the federal level of $7.25; California’s minimum wage, for example, is $8.\n\nThe agricultural sector has a relatively high share of minimum wage workers. Approximately 2 percent of Texas’ workers are in the ag sector, whereas 1.1 percent of California’s workforce and a mere 0.5 percent of New York’s workforce are employed in agriculture. This is true especially in the border area, which also has many migrant workers and where the level of education is relatively low. Finally, Texas has a younger workforce than the nation, further boosting the share of minimum wage earners in the state. For example, the leisure and hospitality sector employs a disproportionate number of young people, and the average weekly wage in that sector is a very low $347.\n\nSo those are the facts. The Dallas Fed will henceforth be providing monthly updates on employment in Texas through our website at www.dallasfed.org. We hope it will be a useful tool for everyone ranging from columnists who write for the New York Times to the pundits who provide commentary for Fox News, as well as serious economists.\n\nFOMC Decision\nNow to the second matter I wish to discuss with you today: my decision to dissent from the commitment of the majority of my colleagues on the FOMC in their decision to hold the base interest rate for interbank lending—the fed funds rate, the anchor of the yield curve—at its current level well into 2013.\n\nI have posited both within the FOMC and publicly for some time that there is abundant liquidity available to finance economic expansion and job creation in America. The banking system is awash with liquidity. It is a rare day when the discount windows—the lending facilities of the 12 Federal Reserve banks—experience significant activity. Domestic banks are flush; they have on deposit at the 12 Federal Reserve banks some $1.6 trillion in excess reserves, earning a mere 25 basis points—a quarter of 1 percent per annum—rather than earning significantly higher interest rates from making loans to operating businesses. These excess bank reserves are waiting on the sidelines to be lent to businesses. Nondepository financial firms—private equity funds and the like—have substantial amounts of investable cash at their disposal. U.S. corporations are sitting on an abundance of cash—some estimate excess working capital on publicly traded corporations’ books exceeds $1 trillion—well above their working capital needs. Nonpublicly held businesses that are creditworthy have increasing access to bank credit at historically low nominal rates.\n\nI have said many times that through the initiatives we took to counter the crisis of 2008–09, and the dramatic extension of the balance sheet that ensued, the Fed has refilled the tanks needed to fuel economic expansion and domestic job creation. Though I questioned the efficacy of the expansion of our balance sheet through the purchase of Treasury securities known as “QE2,” I have come to expect that the Federal Open Market Committee would continue to anchor the base lending rate at current levels and also maintain our abnormally large balance sheet, now with footings of almost $2.9 trillion, for “an extended period.”\n\nI do not believe it wise to commit to more than that, or to signal further accommodation, when the cheap and abundant liquidity we have made available is presently lying fallow, and when the velocity of money remains so subdued as to be practically comatose. At the FOMC meeting, the committee announced that it “currently anticipates that economic conditions … are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013.” In monetary parlance, that is language designed to signal that we are on hold until then.\n\nI voted against that commitment-cum-signal. In the press’ reporting of my dissenting vote and those of the other two members of the FOMC who voted against that commitment—Mr. Kocherlakota, my counterpart from the Minneapolis Fed, and Mr. Plosser, my counterpart from Philadelphia—there was substantial speculation as to the reasons for our dissent. I will let my other two colleagues speak for themselves; I can only speak for myself. Let me make clear why I was opposed to freezing the fed funds rate for two years.\n\nFirst, in reporting my views to the committee, I noted my concern for the fragility of the U.S. economy and weak job creation. It might be noted by the press here today that although I am constantly preoccupied with price stability—in the aviary of central bankers, I am known as a “hawk” on inflation—I did not voice concern for the prospect of inflationary pressures in the foreseeable future. Indeed, the Dallas Fed’s trimmed mean analysis of the inflationary developments in June indicated that the trimmed mean PCE turned in its softest reading of the year. The trimmed mean analysis we do at the Dallas Fed focuses on the price movements of personal consumption expenditures. It is an analysis that tracks the price movements of 178 items that people actually buy, such as beer, haircuts, shoe repair, food and energy prices. In June, the trimmed mean came in at an annualized rate of 1.3 percent, versus 2.1 percent for the first five months of the year. The 12-month rate was 1.5 percent.\n\nMy concern is not with immediate inflationary pressures. Core producer prices are still increasing at a higher than desirable rate. But I have suggested to my colleagues that while many companies have begun and will likely continue to raise prices to counter rising costs that derive from a range of factors—including the run-up of commodity prices in 2010 and increases in the costs of production in China—weak demand is beginning to temper the ability of providers of goods and services to significantly raise prices to consumers.\n\nMy concern is with the transmission mechanism for activating the use of the liquidity we have created, which remains on the sidelines of the economy. I posit that nonmonetary factors, not monetary policy, are retarding the willingness and ability of job creators to put to work the liquidity that we have provided.\n\nI have spoken to this many times in public. Those with the capacity to hire American workers—small businesses as well as large, publicly traded or private—are immobilized. Not because they lack entrepreneurial zeal or do not wish to grow; not because they can’t access cheap and available credit. Rather, they simply cannot budget or manage for the uncertainty of fiscal and regulatory policy. In an environment where they are already uncertain of potential growth in demand for their goods and services and have yet to see a significant pickup in top-line revenue, there is palpable angst surrounding the cost of doing business. According to my business contacts, the opera buffa of the debt ceiling negotiations compounded this uncertainty, leaving business decisionmakers frozen in their tracks.\n\nI would suggest that unless you were on another planet, no consumer with access to a television, radio or the Internet could have escaped hearing their president, senators and their congressperson telling them the sky was falling. With the leadership of the nation—Republicans and Democrats alike—and every talking head in the media making clear hour after hour, day after day in the run-up to Aug. 2 that a financial disaster was lurking around the corner, it does not take much imagination to envision consumers deciding to forego or delay some discretionary expenditure they had planned. Instead, they might well be inclined to hunker down to weather the perfect storm they were being warned was rapidly approaching. Watching the drama as it unfolded, I could imagine consumers turning to each other in millions of households, saying: “Honey, we need to cancel that trip we were planning and that gizmo or service we wanted to buy. We better save more and spend less.” Small wonder that, following the somewhat encouraging retail activity reported in July, the Michigan survey measure of consumer sentiment released just recently had a distinctly sour tone.\n\nImportantly, from a business operator’s perspective, nothing was clarified, except that there will be undefined change in taxes, spending and subsidies and other fiscal incentives or disincentives. The message was simply that some combination of revenue enhancement and spending growth cutbacks will take place. The particulars are left to one’s imagination and the outcome of deliberations among 12 members of the Legislature.\n\nNow, put yourself in the shoes of a business operator. On the revenue side, you have yet to see a robust recovery in demand; growing your top-line revenue is vexing. You have been driving profits or just maintaining your margins through cost reduction and achieving maximum operating efficiency. You have money in your pocket or a banker increasingly willing to give you credit if and when you decide to expand. But you have no idea where the government will be cutting back on spending, what measures will be taken on the taxation front and how all this will affect your cost structure or customer base. Your most likely reaction is to cross your arms, plant your feet and say: “Show me. I am not going to hire new workers or build a new plant until I have been shown what will come out of this agreement.” Moreover, you might now say to yourself, “I understand from the Federal Reserve that I don’t have to worry about the cost of borrowing for another two years. Given that I don’t know how I am going to be hit by whatever new initiatives the Congress will come up with, but I do know that credit will remain cheap through the next election, what incentive do I have to invest and expand now? Why shouldn’t I wait until the sky is clear?”\n\nBased on past behavior of fiscal policy makers, businesses understandably regard the debt ceiling agreement and the political outcome of negotiations between Congress and the president with the suspicion akin to how the British humorist P.G. Wodehouse regarded his aunts: “It is no use telling me there are bad aunts and good aunts,” he wrote. “At the core they are all alike. Sooner or later, out pops the cloven hoof.”[2]\n\nIt will be devilishly difficult for businesses to commit to adding significantly to their head count or to meaningful capital expansion in the United States until clarity is achieved on the particulars of how Congress will bend the curve of deficit and debt expansion and the “cloven hooves” are revealed. No amount of monetary accommodation can substitute for that needed clarity. In fact, it can only make it worse if business comes to suspect that the central bank is laying the groundwork for eventually inflating our way out of our fiscal predicament rather than staying above the political fray—thus creating another tranche of uncertainty.\n\nIn the interest of full disclosure, I should add that I was also concerned that just by tweaking the language the way the committee did, our action might be interpreted as encouraging the view that there is an FOMC so-called “Bernanke put” that would be too easily activated in response to a reversal in the financial markets. For those of you unfamiliar with the expression “Bernanke put,” or more generally, a “central bank put,” this term refers to the concept that a central bank will allow the stock market to rise significantly without tightening monetary policy, but will ease monetary policy whenever there is a stock market “correction.” Given the extent of the drop in the stock market leading up to and following Standard & Poor’s downgrade of U.S. debt, combined with the FOMC’s commitment to hold short-term rates near zero until mid-year 2013, some cynical observers might interpret such a policy action as a “Bernanke put.” My long-standing belief is that the Federal Reserve should never enact such asymmetric policies to protect stock market traders and investors. I believe my FOMC colleagues share this view.\n\nConnecting the Dots\nNow, how do you connect the dots between Texas’ record of economic growth and my dissenting vote?\n\nDespite the fact that Texas has severely limited social services and an education system that faces great challenges, people and businesses have been picking up stakes and moving to Texas in significant numbers over a prolonged period.[3] It should be noted that in the last census, Texas gained population and congressional seats, while California’s population growth and congressional representation was static and New York’s was diminished. Jobs have been created for American workers in Texas in several different sectors, not just in the oil and gas and mining sectors. People have taken those jobs of their own free will, even though the jobs may not measure up to the compensation levels everyone would like. And yet Texas, like all states, is subject to the same monetary policy as all the rest: We have the same interest rates and access to capital as the residents of any of the other 49 states, for the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy and regulates financial institutions under its purview for the nation at large. From this, I draw the conclusion that private sector capital and jobs will go to where taxes and spending and regulatory policy are most conducive to growth.\n\nTherein lies a lesson for our fiscal policy makers as they grapple with their monumental task of reconfiguring fiscal policy and eliminating the prevailing uncertainty about their remedy.\n\nWe live in a world that, through steadfast sacrifice of the American treasure and with blood and capable diplomacy, won the Cold War, induced the Chinese to pull back the Bamboo Curtain and opened up the majority of the world to once unimaginable economic opportunity. China, the rest of Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, India, most of Latin America and significant swathes of Africa are eager to improve the lot of their people through full participation in the global economy. In doing so, they have become serious competitors for capital, including that plentiful and affordable capital we at the Federal Reserve have created.\n\nIn a cyberized, globalized world, those with the means to create jobs will gravitate to those places that provide the best prospect for a return on the investment of the abundant capital on business’ balance sheets or available to them in the marketplace or from eager bankers. Just as many people and firms within the United States have relocated to Texas from other states, investment will flow to countries anywhere in the world where it is most welcome.\n\nOur fiscal authorities must not only figure out the way to contain the nation’s runaway deficits and public debt accumulation, but they must do so in a manner that is competitive with others who seek access to our money, and do so in a manner that does not pull the rug out from under the meager recovery we are experiencing. The Committee of 12 and the president have an awesome task. Essentially, they must reboot our entire system of economic incentives and come forward with an updated tax and spending and regulatory regime that incentivizes businesses to invest in the United States and create jobs for American workers rather than gravitate to foreign shores. And they must do so in a manner that avoids engaging in a race to the bottom, but rather, puts us back on the path to ever higher achievement of prosperity.\n\nThe sooner they get on it, the better. Uncertainty is corrosive; it is hurting job creation and capital expansion when we need it most. As Margaret Thatcher would say: “Don’t dawdle. And don’t go wobbly on us, Congress.” Monetary policy cannot substitute for what you must get on with doing. Get on with your job.\n\nThe Ugly Truth\nI think I have made it pretty clear today that I believe what is restraining our economy is not monetary policy but fiscal misfeasance in Washington. We elect our national leaders to safeguard our country. An integral part of that consists of safeguarding the nation’s fiscal probity. Pointing fingers at the Fed only diminishes credibility—the ugly truth is that the problem lies not with monetary policy but in the need to construct a modern, appropriate set of fiscal and regulatory levers and pulleys to better incentivize the private sector to channel money into productive use in expanding our economy and enriching our people. Only Congress, working together with the president, has the power to write the rules and provide the incentives to correct the course of the great ship we know and love as America. I hope you, as the voters who put them in office, will demand no less of them.\n\nThank you. I will be happy to do my level best to avoid answering any questions you might have.",

            "content": "July 13, 2011 Dallas, Texas\n\nThank you, Jim [Struble], for that kind introduction.\n\nIt is always a pleasure to speak to Rotarians. Until I went to Washington in 1997 to serve as the deputy U.S. trade representative, I was a member of this wonderful downtown club. I especially loved the patriotism and the esprit de corps that characterize every meeting. I have always considered Rotarians the Marine Corps of the civic community. Remember what Ronald Reagan said about the Marines? &ldquo;Some people spend an entire lifetime wondering if they have made a difference. The Marines don&rsquo;t have that problem.&rdquo; Neither do Rotarians.\n\nNor do they have a problem injecting a little humor to lighten the load of the day. When I was a member of this great club, Carol Reed used to read the &ldquo;news&rdquo; at the beginning of every meeting, picking subjects not ordinarily reported in the traditional media. One of her most memorable reports was about a man who had fallen into a river in Egypt and had allegedly managed to fight off an attack by a 14-foot crocodile. The punch line, of course, was that if you didn&rsquo;t believe a man could fend off a croc with his bare hands, then you yourself were in &ldquo;de-Nile.&rdquo;\n\nWe are no longer in denial about our national economic plight. Our great country now finds itself in a very difficult predicament. It is true that the situation here in Texas is relatively better than that of the nation; Texas is an oasis in a national economic desert devoid of life-giving job creation. We went into the Great Recession last and were one of the first to come out. As we have for the past 20 years, we continue to outpace the rest of the United States in employment growth by a significant margin. Since the Great Recession officially ended in June 2009, only North Dakota (a plucky state whose hearty population totals less than that of Collin or Denton counties) has seen faster job growth than Texas.[1] As I speak, Texas has almost as many people employed as we did before the recession began. Our banks are in better shape than those in the rest of the country; we are benefiting from the blessings of nature, with copious amounts of oil and gas and abundant agricultural production; our fellow citizens have seen to it that our Legislature continues to hew to a tax, regulatory and legal environment that attracts job-creating investment and encourages business formation and growth. And yet, even in this blessed state, there are too many unemployed and underemployed, just as there are in the rest of America. We can do better. America must do better.\n\nThe question is: How?\n\nTo create employment, we must have economic growth.\n\nThe simplest of econometric equations posits that the key components of economic growth are domestic consumption, plus foreign demand for U.S.-produced exports, plus investment by businesses, plus spending by government.\n\nI think it is pretty clear to everyone who lives on the planet that in order to grow our economy and put our people back to work, we must rely on our ability to curry to domestic and foreign consumption and invest here at home to produce the goods and services to sell in the marketplace. You&rsquo;d have to be from Mars to believe that the federal and state governments will be the source of much direct spending stimulus to the economy.\n\nPresently, all eyes are focused on the budget negotiations in Washington as the debt-ceiling clock ticks on. Aesop&rsquo;s classic fable comes to mind. Rather than work like ants to build and store for difficult times, our fiscal authorities&mdash;Congress after Congress, under Republican and Democrat leadership alike, and with presidents of both parties occupying the White House&#8213;have been proverbial grasshoppers. Except for a few interludes, they have partied along for decades using the people&rsquo;s money as though life were an endless summer, storing nothing to draw upon for the blustery fall and the bleak winter that inevitably follow. Now a fiscal reckoning is upon us. The gig is up. Congress can no longer carry on as before, oblivious to the deleterious effect of spending our, and the successor generations&rsquo;, money with unfunded abandon.\n\nTongue firmly in cheek, Carol Reed might have reminded us that there are alternative versions of this fable. In 1924, Somerset Maugham wrote a version about two brothers: one an ant-like hard worker and the other a grasshopper wastrel. In the end, the grasshopper marries a rich widow who dies and leaves him a fortune.[2] Case closed! In Things Change, a film released by Columbia Pictures in 1988, the character played by Don Ameche recites a version in which the grasshopper, fed up with all this moralizing about the virtues of hard work and saving for a rainy day, just up and eats the ant.\n\nI think we can safely assume that neither of these scenarios will occur. No one is going to bail out the government at the last minute. The ants that are the hard-working taxpayers are, if anything, poised to chew up and spit out improvident politicians should they fail to put an end to fiscal profligacy. The fiscal authorities have no choice but to come to terms with the need to bring about a better balance between taxes and spending and to not only bend the curve, but reverse the inexorable growth in federal debt accumulation. This is the stuff of the great negotiations taking place among the executive branch and the two houses of Congress.\n\nThis is no small chore. The parties involved must stop the hemorrhaging without inducing cardiac arrest; they must solve the long-run debt and deficit problem without, in the short run, pushing the economy back into recession, creating still more unemployment. And they must not only confront their addiction to debt and spending beyond their means, but they must reorganize the tax system, redirect the money they collect and rewrite the regulations they create so as to be competitive in a world that wants to beat us at our own game.\n\nThis is an essential point. It will not be enough to reach a deal on the debt ceiling or on partially reining in deficits. In the post-Cold War, post-Bamboo Curtain world, there are many governments and great swathes of people outside the United States that want to attract investment and improve their lot. We are being challenged as the place to invest job-creating capital. Our fiscal and regulatory authorities do not operate in a vacuum; we live in a globalized, interconnected world where money is free to go to wherever it earns the best return. In their solution to the debt crisis, our political leaders must develop an entirely new structure of incentives for private businesses and investors to put their money to work creating jobs here at home.\n\nOnly fiscal authorities have the power to affect this outcome. Monetary authorities, like me and my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve (FOMC), have limited influence. We can fill the gas tank with attractively priced fuel&#8213;abundant and cheap money&#8213;needed to propel the economy forward. But we cannot trigger the impulse to step on the pedal and engage the transmission mechanism of job-creating investment by the private sector. This is the province of those who write our laws and regulations&#8213;the Congress of the United States.\n\nI firmly believe that the Federal Reserve has already pressed the limits of monetary policy. So-called QE2, to my way of thinking, was of doubtful efficacy, which is why I did not support it to begin with. But even if you believe the costs of QE2 were worth its purported benefits, you would be hard pressed to now say that still more liquidity, or more fuel, is called for given the more than $1.5 trillion in excess bank reserves and the substantial liquid holdings above the normal working capital needs of corporate businesses. Even surveys of small businesses&mdash;most recently, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce&rsquo;s survey of companies with less than $25 million in sales and fewer than 500 employees&mdash;indicate that fewer than 10 percent of small enterprises (which employ half of the private sector&rsquo;s workers) are having problems accessing credit.[3] The National Federation of Independent Business specifically noted just yesterday that &ldquo;91 percent [of those surveyed in June] reported that all their credit needs were met or that they were not interested in borrowing.&rdquo;[4]\n\nU.S. banks and businesses are awash in liquidity. Adding more is not the answer to our problems.\n\nWith monetary policy having reached the limits of accommodation, and the federal government at sixes and sevens, what then is the foreseeable economic outlook? Are we going to grow through the rest of the year and on into the next, or are we going to dip back into recession?\n\nForecasting economic growth is not a precise business. Economics is an art form, not a science; it is very judgmental and subjective. The FOMC is composed of 17 thoughtful, introspective and deliberate men and women. Five of the members serve full time in Washington as Governors of the Federal Reserve Board, appointed by presidents of the United States with the approval of Congress. The remaining 12, like me, are chosen by nine-member, nonpolitical boards of directors of citizens in their districts and charged with conducting the business of the Fed in the field based on our business acumen and with developing policy insights based upon what we see, hear and measure on Main Street. Together, the 17 of us formulate policy with the best judgment we can collectively muster, free from political pressures or the passions of the moment, on what is in the best long-term interest of the country&rsquo;s economy.\n\nWe each gin up forecasts for the economy. All 17 FOMC participants&rsquo; expectations for the economy through 2013 and beyond were released to the public yesterday and widely reported in the press today.[5] To develop those forecasts, we employ sophisticated econometric models, study the entrails of numerous comprehensive surveys conducted all across the nation&#8213;like the Dallas Fed&rsquo;s Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey and the Texas Retail Outlook Survey and their counterparts in other Federal Reserve districts&#8213;and draw upon input from our boards of directors, numerous advisory boards and contacts with businesses and stakeholders nationwide and worldwide. These forecasts are helpful guideposts, but they must be kept in context.\n\nKenneth Arrow, one of the most notable Nobel Laureates in economics, has his own perspective on forecasting. During World War II, he served as a weather officer in the U.S. Army Air Corps and worked with a team charged with the particularly difficult task of producing month-ahead weather forecasts. As Arrow and his team reviewed these predictions, they confirmed statistically what you and I might just as easily have guessed: The Corps&rsquo; weather forecasts were no more useful than random rolls of a die. Understandably, the forecasters asked to be relieved of this seemingly futile duty. Arrow&rsquo;s recollection of his superiors&rsquo; response was priceless: &ldquo;The commanding general is well aware that the forecasts are no good. However, he needs them for planning purposes.&rdquo;[6]\n\nKeep Ken Arrow in mind when you hear economists tout precise forecasts carried out several places to the right of the decimal point. You may need economists&rsquo; forecasts for planning purposes, but you should always take them with a grain of salt, even when the time horizon is a short one. I will direct you to an article in the Feb. 14 Wall Street Journal as evidence. The Journal had polled 51 leading economists, and they forecast that gross domestic product (GDP) would expand 3.6 percent in that very same first quarter.[7] Growth came in at 1.9 percent.\n\nWhen economists forecast we will have growth of, say 3.6 percent, remember they are saying .036. It is an elaborate conceit to think anybody can be that precise in an economy as large as that of the United States, operating as it does within the context of an even larger, very dynamic, global economy. This is true for Fed economists as well as academics and those who sell their forecasts for a living.\n\nThis is not to say that we will cease and desist from making &ldquo;point&rdquo; forecasts. But what matters most to me is the direction in which the numbers are headed and the general sense of momentum. At this juncture, I think it sufficient to say that, assuming the people we elect to tax us and spend our money and create the rules and regulations that govern our economic behavior can at long last get their act together, confront their own denial of most rudimentary budgetary discipline, learn to shoot straight and remove the Damocles Sword of uncertainty that they have for too long unwittingly wielded over our job-creating private sector, there is plenty of potential for the economy to move forward at an accelerating clip. This is especially the case now that the Fed has reliquified the economy.\n\nI expect that economic activity will accelerate in the second half of this year, with real GDP likely to rise at an average annual rate of between 3 and 4 percent. Lest you get carried away with excitement, I must note that some of the acceleration in activity will be a function of inventory adjustment, and much will stem from an unwinding of the disruption caused by the Japanese earthquake and tsunami as the Japanese make up for supply interruptions to the auto and other industries faster than many thought possible. Looking beyond 2011, I hope that growth above 3 percent can be sustained, again assuming the fiscal authorities get it right.\n\nAs Jim has referenced, I may have called the bottom of the recession in the summer of 2009 well before most anybody else did, but I made the point in that Dallas Morning News interview that going forward, we were going to have a slow slog.[8] I have said many times since then that, in light of the fact that we were recovering from &ldquo;post-traumatic shock syndrome&rdquo; stemming from the Panic of 2008 and 2009, economic recovery would proceed hesitantly, taking two steps forward and one step back until it finds its new legs. We took a step backward in the first half; I expect we will proceed forward, however haltingly, in the second half and into 2012.\n\nThe point is that I do not think we need be stuck in the low gear of the first half. Some of the temporary influences that I believe retarded growth in the first half&#8213;high gasoline and unprocessed-food prices, the supply disruptions in Japan, etc.&mdash;are passing through the system and are either being reversed or digested. To be sure, some businesses are being hit with higher input costs from imported goods and other nonlabor cost increases. Having become as lean as possible and having learned to preserve their margins by years of tight cost management and by maximizing productivity, they don&rsquo;t have much fat to absorb the cost of input increases. If input price increases continue or spread, these businesses will naturally attempt to pass them on to consumers, who are wary of anything else that will compress their living standards.\n\nI see a bit of a tug-of-war developing here. The issue will be whether businesses can exercise pricing power in the face of fallow consumer demand. As an inflation &ldquo;hawk&rdquo;&#8213;I prefer to think of myself and my 16 colleagues, hawks and doves alike, as wise owls&#8213;I am watching this very carefully. If I see inflation continuing to rise and, most importantly, inflationary expectations beginning to spread, I will be the first out of the box to advocate the removal of the substantial monetary accommodation now in place. I cannot think of anything more damaging to the welfare of hard-working Americans who have jobs, those who are unemployed and barely eking out a living, retirees who are earning minimum returns on their savings, or any consumer already stretched thin, than to have their purchasing power reduced by still higher inflation.\n\nYet even though I am a central banker and am professionally disposed to being a worrywart, I am more optimistic about the economic outlook than the consensus. American businesses and workers have made very important improvements in their efficiency and competitiveness that will aid growth. If we can add to that a sound long-run budget deal, the recovery could gain even more strength. We are a resilient people. I know it is fashionable to think we have somehow been infected with an economic stasis with no way out, but as a Texan and an American, I am culturally unable to accept that view.\n\nDuring the Q&amp;A that followed a recent speech of mine abroad&#8213;in New York&#8213;a questioner cited the sickly economic pace of the first quarter and then recited the consensus view that very weak growth will likely ensue for the rest of the year and beyond. In response, I cautioned that forecasting based on current trends can be very misleading. And the consensus view&#8213;usually conveyed with confidence all the way out to three places to the right of the decimal point&#8213;is almost always wrong, even within short time periods.\n\nI asked my interlocutor to recall the presidential election of 1948. The consensus view called for a landslide victory by Gov. Dewey. Indeed, an early edition of the Chicago Daily Tribune on the very night of the election announced in the boldest of headlines that Dewey had won. Before going to sleep, an overconfident Dewey is reported to have turned to his wife and said, &ldquo;Just think about it: Tomorrow night, you are going to be sleeping with the president of the United States!&rdquo;\n\nThe next morning at breakfast, Mrs. Dewey asked, &ldquo;Am I going up to Washington this evening or is Harry Truman coming to our house?&rdquo;\n\nCarol Reed would love to have reported that story!\n\nThank you, Rotarians. You are the embodiment of what makes this country great. Carry on with your good works.",

            "content": "June 16, 2011 Dallas, Texas\n\nI am here today not simply to say bienvenido and welcome you to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas with un fuerte abrazo, but to underscore the importance I attach to our achieving a better understanding of the Hispanic economic experience and, very importantly, the potential for greater Hispanic advancement within the U.S. economy.\n\nLet me cut to the quick: Hispanics are underachieving in our society, especially in Texas. Here are the data:\n\nThose are some basic facts. Here are some others for you to consider:\n\nFor the past 20 years, the Eleventh Federal Reserve District―in which 96 percent of the economic output is generated by Texas―has outgrown the rest of the Federal Reserve districts and the United States by significant margins. We have grown our real―or inflation-adjusted output (real state gross domestic product)―by 3.6 percent compounded over 20 years, whereas the rest of the U.S. (real gross domestic product) has grown at 2.5 percent compounded; annual job growth in Texas has outpaced the nation by 1 percentage point a year; population growth within Texas has compounded over the past two decades by 2 percent per annum, versus 1.1 percent for the rest of the nation.\n\nWe now have the second-largest Congressional delegation in the country behind California. But the growth dynamic here is vibrant, whereas that of California is stagnant. This is why we are picking up population and Congressional seats, while the recent U.S. census apportioned no additional seats to California.\n\nIn sum, we are a vibrant and strong economy. The economic tenor in California and the rest of America is weary, if not downright weak: Somos fuerte; los otros son flojos. Since the recent economic recession ended, Texas has been responsible for 48 percent of all the jobs created in America.\n\nAnd yet, the Hispanic population is not participating in our economic prosperity in proportion to its weight in the Texas census.\n\nThe unemployment rate among Latinos here is substantially higher than it is for non-Hispanic Texans. Hispanics earn 36 percent less in hourly wages than non-Hispanic whites; median household income of Latino-headed households in Texas is about 60 percent of median household income of non-Hispanic households. For the U.S. as a whole, Latino-headed households earn about 73 percent of non- Hispanic white household income.\n\nPia Orrenius and our other economists are hard at work in deciphering what accounts for the differences between the economic status of Texas Hispanics and Latinos elsewhere in the U.S. Already, one factor is clear: Hispanic educational achievement in Texas is abysmal.\n\nIn Texas, as anywhere else in the United States and in all capitalist societies, “you earn what you learn.” Every study known to man, and plain common sense, tell you that income is directly correlated to educational attainment. High school graduates earn significantly more than high school dropouts; a college degree results in greater lifetime earnings than a high school degree; the highest income groups are those with graduate degrees.\n\nNearly 50 percent of Texas public schoolchildren are Hispanic, but only 38 percent of high school graduates are Hispanic.\n\nSome 54 percent of non-Hispanic whites and 48 percent of non-Hispanic blacks age 18 to 24 with a high school degree were in college in 2008. The percentage of Hispanics was only 43 percent.\n\nWithin the age cohort between 25 and 64, only 14 percent of native-born Texas Latinos have college degrees; 23 percent of native-born Hispanics in Texas age 25 to 64 are high school dropouts.\n\nNo matter how you slice it or dice it, it is glaringly clear that Hispanics in Texas are failing at school. This must be corrected. If not, they will continue to trail in economic achievement. And all of us―white, black, Asian-American, Hispanic or non-Hispanic―will suffer the consequences of economic underperformance.\n\nTexas is a remarkable place. We embody the “can do” spirit. My favorite Texas historian is T.R. Fehrenbach. I recommend his book, Lone Star: A History of Texas and the Texans, to anybody who wishes to understand what makes this place unique.\n\nAs Fehrenbach puts it, the key to overcoming the odds in the Lone Star State has been that “the Texas ethic and Texas society rewarded enterprise,” ... “work was the real virtue.” … “We chose this land; we took it; we made it bear fruit.” We are a people, in Fehrenbach’s words, for whom “the cult of courage was obvious.”[1] And he distills the Texas spirit that prevails to this day in one sentence: Here, “men who exist get overrun by men who act.”[2]\n\nIt is time for our great Latino population to have the courage to face the facts: They must do a better job as families and within their communities to dedicate themselves to educational achievement. And it is time for all Texans, Hispanics and non-Hispanics, to act to create the conditions that will safeguard and nourish the prosperity of all our children and that of our children’s children.\n\n¡Ándale pues! Delve into the Hispanic experience. Help us understand through this conference and your various studies how to advance Hispanic prosperity. For in doing so, you are helping us advance Texas and the nation.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "June 6, 2011 New York, N.Y.\n\nThank you for that kind introduction. This discerning audience no doubt noted that despite being overeducated, I am not a formally trained economist. I do not have a Ph.D. in economics; those who do will correctly deduce that I am somewhat “dismal” in comprehending the arcana of “the Dismal Science.” After my undergraduate education in economics and my studies at Oxford, I took a different path. I earned an MBA and then went to Wall Street and into funds management before cashing out and taking to public service. My perspective on monetary policy and regulation is shaped less by theory and more by my experience as a market operator.\n\nI confess that in matters of monetary policy and regulation, I am often in the minority. This does not make me the least bit uncomfortable. The majority opinion is not always right; indeed, my experience as an investor has biased me to conclude that more often than not, the consensus view is the wrong view, even among the most erudite. Exhibit A of the fallibility of consensus thinking is the herd mentality among supposedly sophisticated financiers as well as theoretical economists who believe in efficient-markets theory and other nonsense themes that led us into the recent financial crisis. I happen to believe that Margaret Thatcher, the former British prime minister, was right when she said, “You cannot lead from the crowd.”[1] There is a role for contrarians, not just in the investment arena, but also at the highest level of policymaking; at a minimum, it is important to question and challenge consensus views, even when they are formed by the most credentialed individuals.\n\nFor example, some of you may recall the public letter written by 364 eminent economists predicting disastrous consequences that would result from Thatcher’s policy initiatives. That letter was published in the Times of London on March 30, 1981.[2] The British economy began a recovery almost immediately afterward, in 1982; by 1983, inflation and mortgage rates were at their lowest levels in over a decade, while economic growth accelerated. The failure of the consensus view led Chancellor of the Exchequer Geoffrey Howe to define an economist as “a man who knows 364 ways of making love, but doesn't know any women.”[3]\n\nTo be sure, economic theories and econometric models are of great utility for providing a framework for policymaking; we cannot make policy without them. But they are imperfect substitutes for common sense. The late New York intellectual Irving Kristol is reported to have said: “Don’t fall for fantastical notions that have nothing to do with the way people really are.”[4] My experience of having worked in real time in the financial markets leads me to a different perspective on financial operators and markets than that of most of my colleagues at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). This not only affects my views on the implementation of monetary policy, but also shapes my perspective on regulation.\n\nMonetary policy and regulation are intricately linked. When conducting its monetary policy, the Fed is governed by a dual mandate: creating the monetary conditions to foster maximum employment growth while constraining inflation and its alter ego, deflation. These goals cannot be realized without financial stability that results from effective regulation. As the FOMC now sets its sights on concluding the accommodative monetary policy it fashioned to stave off financial collapse and deflation, our supervision and regulation team is wrestling with developing the appropriate policy for dealing with the lingering effects of the financial crisis, and, most importantly, erecting a new regulatory framework to substantially reduce the chances of financial crises. Or at least make them more manageable, should one occur again. (In all candor, it would be more historically accurate to say “when one occurs again,” because crises and panics have occurred repeatedly throughout history, including three times just in my own career: the mid-1970s, the late 1980s and just recently).\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s efforts to revamp the regulatory framework are being led by Governor Tarullo, who is providing focused, important leadership on this critical matter.[5] The revamping.is largely shaped by the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd–Frank”), which became law last summer. The act establishes a new regulatory infrastructure for promoting financial stability. Among its most prominent macroprudential features is the Financial Stability Oversight Council, an interagency body charged with detecting and deterring threats to the financial system. The act also establishes an Office of Financial Research, a mechanism for the orderly winding down of failing financial firms, and new responsibilities for the Federal Reserve in overseeing certain nonbank financial companies and certain payment, clearing and settlement utilities. The Federal Reserve Board is also directed to develop enhanced prudential standards for large banking organizations and systemically important nonbank financial firms.\n\nDodd–Frank itself mostly provides only high-level direction, leaving an extraordinary number of details and critical decisionmaking to regulatory discretion. As a result, the ultimate nature and future of reform rest in the hands of regulators. As many of you are aware, the various regulatory agencies are presently seeking public comments on a range of issues involving implementation of Dodd–Frank.\n\nMost regulatory reform initiatives applied since the Banking Act of 1864 have missed the mark. They looked good on paper and appeared to solve the problems of the day but later proved not up to the task. This is especially true with efforts to solve the “too big to fail” problem, in which an unwillingness to follow through on prior policy commitments to actually close down large failures and impose losses on their uninsured creditors has led to what economists call “time inconsistency” in policy. Let’s hope this time will be different, that regulators will make their commitments credible and consistent with future rather than past needs.[6]\n\nHaving come from the financial industry, I take a keen interest in these issues, and I hold some strong opinions as to how we should proceed. I believe there are leverage points for effective reform. There are areas where, if regulators act decisively, they might have profound positive effects and avoid time inconsistency. Conversely, there are other areas where regulatory action would at best generate small benefits and, in the worst case, might actually be counterproductive.\n\nThe key to successful reform will be to identify the leverage points that exist and do our best to ensure regulators are up to the task in those areas while not burdening other aspects of the financial system with heavy intervention that might trigger the law of unintended consequences.\n\nEye on Target\n\nLet us be clear about the goals of reform. With so much energy being expended on the what, the when and the how of implementing Dodd–Frank, the first risk we run is forgetting the why—the reasons for the act, its primary goals.\n\nFor this, we need only turn to the law itself, the preamble, which spells out the key objectives as follows: “To promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system, to end ‘too big to fail,’ to protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts, to protect consumers from abusive financial services practices and for other purposes.”[7] On the subject of too big to fail, the legislation is quite blunt. The Conference Report summary of the legislation’s key provisions, provided in plain English by the Senate Banking Committee, states that it seeks to end “the possibility that taxpayers will be asked to write a check to bail out financial firms that threaten the economy by: creating a safe way to liquidate failed financial firms; imposing tough new capital and leverage requirements that make it undesirable to get too big; updating the Fed’s authority to allow system-wide support but no longer prop up individual firms; and establishing rigorous standards and supervision to protect the economy and American consumers, investors and businesses.”[8]\n\nWhile there is much to criticize about Dodd–Frank, I cotton to those blunt statements on ending too big to fail. For, if after the myriad rules and regulations are written and implemented we have not eradicated too big to fail from our financial infrastructure, reform will have failed yet again.\n\nI have spoken to this topic on several occasions.[9] If you pull up a copy of the Sept. 28, 2009, Wall Street Journal, you will find an article I wrote with my colleague Harvey Rosenblum about the interference too big to fail poses for the effective conduct of monetary policy. In looking at regulatory reform and implementing Dodd–Frank, I think a key point worth repeating is that the distinction between “commercial banks” and “the shadow banking system” is a false one. The two became intertwined beginning with the bypassing of Glass–Steagall strictures by Sandy Weill and Citicorp and the deregulatory initiative of Gramm–Leach–Bliley. The fact is that the largest commercial banks played a major role in many of the more problematic phenomena of the recent credit boom and ensuing crisis, including the spread of what I have previously referred to as financial STDs, or securitization transmitted diseases.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Panic, these viruses linger. Last week, the New York Times printed an interesting article by Joe Nocera, who drew upon the observations of a highly regarded regional banker from Buffalo, Robert Wilmers of M&T Bank.[10] Wilmers claimed that of the $75 billion made by the six largest bank-holding companies last year, $56 billion derived from trading revenues. Nocera noted that “in 2007, the chief executives of the Too Big to Fail Banks made, on average, $26 million … more than double the compensation of the top nonbank Fortune 500 executives.” A recent survey conducted for the Wall Street Journal of CEO compensation at 350 public companies shows that financial services compensation has been tempered; the rate of increase in compensation for 2010 was just 1 percent.[11] The Journal attributed this to higher levels of scrutiny of financial firms as well as pressure from shareholders and regulators. Even so, some financial-sector CEOs enjoyed robust increases in their total compensation, including a 74 percent increase and a 51 percent increase at two of the five largest U.S. banking organizations. Interestingly, the trading revenue of these two firms accounted for almost half of the $56 billion in total trading revenue mentioned by Mr. Wilmers. These recent numbers buttress Nocera’s reasonable conclusion that bank CEOs “were being compensated in no small part on their trading profits—which gave them every incentive to keep taking those excessive risks.”\n\nI am sympathetic to these concerns. I have no problem with risk takers being rewarded with large compensation packages. I put my own and my partners’ capital at risk for the 20 years I operated in the markets and profited handsomely. But I never was provided with capital that was safeguarded by government guarantees. There is no logic to having the public underwrite through deposit insurance or subsidize through protective regulation the risk-taking ventures of large financial institutions and their executives. There is a substantial case to be made for separating the “public utility”—or traditional core function of banking—from the risk-taking function.\n\nTo be sure, financial problems are not limited to large institutions and their complex, opaque and conflicted operations. Regional and community institutions that have, for the most part, stuck to the public utility function have faced their own difficulties, especially in the context of construction lending. But while over 300 banks failed during the crisis, another 7,000 did not. Community and regional banks that are not too big to fail appear to have succumbed less to the herdlike mentality and promiscuous financial behavior that affected their megabank peers.\n\nMoreover, when smaller banks got into deep trouble, regulators generally took them over and resolved them. In the treatment of big banks, regulators, for the most part, tiptoed around them. Failing big banks were allowed to lumber on, with government support, despite the extensive damage they wrought. Big banks that gambled and generated unsustainable losses received a huge public benefit: too-big-to-fail support.\n\nPostcrisis, the large institutions are even larger: The top 10 now account for 64 percent of assets, up from 58 percent before the crisis and substantially higher than the 25 percent they accounted for in 1990. In effect, more prudent and better-managed banks have been denied the market share that would have been theirs if mismanaged big banks had been allowed to go out of business. This strikes me as counter to the very essence of competition that is the hallmark of American capitalism: Prudently managed banks are being victimized by publicly subsidized competition from less-prudent institutions.\n\nA student of existentialism is tempted to recall Nietzsche’s lament that, “He who is punished is never he who performed the deed.”[12] An acerbic devotee of H.L. Mencken might be given to recite his dictum that while “injustice is relatively easy to bear; what stings is justice.”[13] I do not doubt for a New York minute that the savvy big players who “performed the deed” did so with confidence they would be protected by the authorities who might find “justice” difficult to impose. In solving the crisis at hand during the Panic, it appears that the most imprudent of lenders and investors were protected from the consequences of their decisions; the sinners were rescued and the virtuous penalized. In crafting regulations in response to Dodd–Frank, we need to restore market discipline in banking and let the market mete out its own brand of justice for excessive risk-taking rather than prolong the injustice of too big to fail.\n\nIt is not difficult to see where this dynamic, if uncorrected, will lead—to more pronounced financial cycles and recurring crises. I would argue that the failure to reform the banking system in Japan was one of the principal reasons for that country’s “Lost Decade(s).” We must not let that pathology take hold here.\n\nMaking Matters Worse\n\nIf we do not keep this ultimate goal of reform firmly in mind, our rule making not only might fail to promote the original objectives of reform, but could actually work against them. Ironically, with Dodd–Frank, such a perverse outcome is a distinct possibility.\n\nThe Dodd–Frank law entails the writing of more than 200 proposals and rules covering a host of issues—risk-based capital requirements, ability-to-pay requirements for home mortgages, protections for consumers sending remittances to foreign countries and so on. The Congress decided the need for these rules to be written, drawing on the input of many, including some very thoughtful economists. Here, I think it wise to draw upon the insight of the classical liberal Frédéric Bastiat in his take on unintended consequences. Bastiat opined, “There is only one difference between a bad economist and a good one: the bad economist confines himself to the visible effect; the good economist takes into account both the effect that can be seen and those effects that must be foreseen.”[14] The same might be said of regulators. As regulators grapple with implementation of the voluminous Dodd–Frank reform act, the unforeseen must be taken into account. The law of unintended consequences is always lurking in the shadows. To get regulatory reform right, we have a lot of “foreseeing” to do.\n\nOne can envision, for example, that the potential cumulative impact of the many regulations demanded by Dodd–Frank will be to artificially raise the cost structure of the non-too-big-to-fail depository institutions. Imposition of the new requirements and restrictions risks creating new economies of scale in banking generated by the costs of regulatory compliance, many of which could be fixed costs not fully proportional to bank size.\n\nTo the extent that a large scale becomes necessary to absorb the regulatory cost associated with reform, Dodd–Frank could intensify the tendency toward bank consolidation, resulting in a more concentrated industry, with the largest institutions predominating even more than in the past. Such an outcome would appear to me contrary to the stated spirit and goal of the act. A more consolidated industry would only magnify the challenge of dealing with systemically important institutions and offsetting their historically elevated too-big-to-fail status.\n\nMy concerns over regulation-induced economies of scale and the implications for industry consolidation apply to all the size classes of banks, given the extensive list of new or enhanced requirements created by Dodd–Frank and their associated compliance costs. As it affects community banking, my concerns are tempered somewhat, though not completely alleviated, by the small-bank exceptions that have been granted to several of the new law’s more costly requirements.\n\nUnfortunately, the same cannot yet be said for the case of regional banks. The act indicates that all banking organizations with more than $50 billion in assets should be subject to enhanced supervision. Some of the related regulatory proposals have already been distributed for comment. Still other proposals for new, stricter “enhanced supervision” rules for these banks will be unveiled soon.\n\nYet, few really believe a $50 billion bank poses a systemic threat to our $17 trillion banking system. Nor is a $50 billion bank qualitatively similar along risk dimensions to the very largest ones that exceed $2 trillion in size. The top 10 banking organizations have a cutoff point of $300 billion. I posit that this group should constitute the primary target for enhanced supervision. Interestingly, despite its large share of industry assets, this group holds only about 20 percent of the small-business loans on bank books. Clearly, these institutions are engaged in substantial activities outside the traditional banking role. It is within these very largest banks, and perhaps a few slightly smaller yet highly complex or interconnected ones, that systemic risk is concentrated.\n\nIf the enhanced-supervision requirements are not highly graduated and imposed primarily on the very largest banks, it is not difficult to imagine how the costs associated with such supervision could lead mid-tier banks that exceed the $50 billion threshold—yet fall well short of megabank status—to seek merger partners in order to achieve sufficient scale by which to help cover the cost of regulation. This would compound the problem rather than alleviate it.\n\nWith regard to enhanced standards for such important factors as capital and liquidity requirements, leverage limits and risk management, Dodd–Frank instructs regulators to differentiate among these banks. Enhanced supervision can be implemented on a graduated scale, based on the extent of assets beyond $50 billion and possibly other factors. Let us do that fully, then, applying these measures along a highly graduated scale, with only minimal added mandates directed at mid-tier banking organizations.\n\nHowever, when it comes to the top 10 or so, I would apply Dodd–Frank extensively and vigorously. I would apply all the elements of heightened supervision—from enhanced standards for capital and liquidity requirements, leverage limits and risk management to the additional measures of living wills and credit-exposure reports, concentration limits, extra public disclosures and short-term debt limits—with full force.\n\nTo this we would add robust annual stress tests conducted by the Federal Reserve, along with the additional tools and procedures of macroprudential supervision, including in-depth horizontal reviews across large companies.\n\nConclusion\n\nI trust regulators will rise to the challenges posed by the financial crisis and too big to fail, leaving a legacy of success and providing a practicable infrastructure for next-generation supervision and regulation.\n\nI quoted Bastiat’s criterion for a good economist as one who accounts for “effects that must be foreseen.” Economists did not do a good job of foreseeing the financial crisis. Neither did regulators. Moreover, previous measures directed at containing too big to fail proved ineffective, with no one too surprised that when crisis came, many large-bank counterparties were protected under implicit guarantees. Let’s hope that going forward, regulators can do better, avoiding both unintended consequences and time inconsistencies. For if they don’t, and they are unable to solve the too-big-to-fail issue in a timely manner, we will ultimately have to take more draconian measures and simply break up the largest banking organizations to eliminate the threat they pose to financial stability and economic growth.\n\nThat is my contrarian view, and I’m sticking with it.\n\nThank you.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "May 4, 2011 Las Cruces, New Mexico\n\nThank you, President [Barbara] Couture, for that kind introduction. It is an honor to speak at New Mexico State University.\n\nI will keep my comments as brief as possible this afternoon so as to leave ample time for Q&A. I want to first provide the précis of the analysis of the nation’s economy that I presented to the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) last week on behalf of the 27 million citizens of the 11th District of the Federal Reserve System, including the citizens of Las Cruces and southern New Mexico. Second, I will discuss inflation as we see it at the Dallas Fed. But before getting into these weighty matters, let me demystify the Federal Reserve System and the Dallas Fed’s role within that System.\n\nIf you look closely at the face of any $1 note, you will see a letter in the middle of the left side. Every $1 bill bears the imprint of one of the Federal Reserve Banks, starting with the “A” of the Boston Fed and ending with the “L” of the San Francisco. Dallas Fed dollars are identified by the letter “K,” surrounded by two concentric circles. The outer circle says “Federal Reserve” and “Texas,” and the inner circle says “Bank of” and “Dallas.” “K” is the 11th letter in the alphabet—in all four corners of the bill are printed the number “11.” The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas is responsible for the administration of the Federal Reserve’s affairs in the 11th of 12 Federal Reserve Districts that were set up by Congress under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. Presently, there are nearly $1 trillion worth ($903 billion to be exact) of Federal Reserve notes in circulation. (Of course, you know that Dallas Fed dollars are of greater nominal value than the others!)\n\nThe economic activity conducted within the Eleventh District—which includes roughly 27 million people and covers some 360,000 square miles in southern New Mexico, Texas and the wooded north of Louisiana—is serviced by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and its three branches.\n\nI am the president and CEO of a $98 billion bank. That bank operates at a profit—a profit that we send to the Treasury. Indeed, the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, collectively, transferred approximately $79 billion to the Treasury in 2010. You are looking at an individual affiliated with one of the few public agencies that actually pay down the federal deficit.\n\nWhat do we do for those 27 million people in the Eleventh District? For starters, we make sure they have the cash they need. In the first quarter of this year, the Dallas Fed distributed and received almost 1.5 billion circulating banknotes, worth nearly $27 billion at face value. Our mammoth machines scan the cash at an average rate of around 100,000 bills per hour and process them so they can be shipped from our vaults in El Paso, Houston and Dallas to banks throughout our district, providing you and the other citizens in our district with folding money. Of course, in addition to making sure there is a sufficient amount in circulation, we have to make sure your folding money is valid and looks respectable: Each month, we cull hundreds of counterfeit bills, and we pluck out about 36 million worn bills that have lived a full life and are ready to be shredded, sent off to money heaven and replaced by new, crisp notes.\n\nBeginning this year, the Dallas Fed no longer processes checks. (In 2009, we processed 120 million paper checks.) Since the use of paper checks has been, and will continue to be, on a substantial decline as consumers and businesses take up electronic counterparts, the Federal Reserve Board decided to consolidate all paper–check processing with the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. (After the loss of LeBron James, losing paper–check processing would have been too much for the city to handle.) The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta will serve as the sole electronic–check processing site for the entire System.\n\nAnother important function of the Dallas Fed is to provide liquidity to district depository institutions through our discount window operations—in other words, to be the ultimate banker’s bank. Those of you in this room who are at all affiliated with depository institutions are certainly aware of this vital function. The lending programs that make up our discount window help relieve liquidity strains by providing a source of short–term funding, which is fully secured and collateralized, to depository institutions to help them conduct uninterrupted business on behalf of you and their other customers. In 2009, we made 594 loans approximating $30 billion, and in 2010, we made 156 loans for about $3 billion. I chair our credit committee and personally review the loans we make every evening. Their size and structure depend on the needs of the borrowing bank.\n\nAmong our other responsibilities is supervising the banking industry within our district. We conduct on–site audits of our state–chartered member banks and bank holding companies and monitor bank performance and stability using electronic surveillance technologies. Currently, we supervise 37 “state member” banks and 522 bank holding companies, ranging from more than $50 billion to less than $20 million in total assets. In June of this year?thanks to the Doddâ??Frank bill?we will take on the responsibility of supervising savings and loan holding companies. We currently have 92 of them in our district.\n\nThis supervisory role is important. I began my private–sector career at the bank of Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., where my superiors instilled in me one overarching principle—one I’m sure the bankers in this room know quite well: Know your customer. Well, we at the Fed rely upon our regulatory relationship to better know our customers, actively monitoring our constituents’ needs and services on the front line of the commercial banking industry and using this insight to be better lenders to all our customers. Without that supervisory and regulatory responsibility, we could not operate effectively as the nation’s lender of last resort. Moreover, the knowledge gained through banking supervision aids the formation of monetary policy.\n\nThe Dallas Fed also organizes public education programs designed to raise financial and economic literacy in our community. We frequently host public events and conferences on significant activities within our economy. Not unimportantly, we work with universities and high schools throughout our district. Our team at our El Paso Branch, for example, works with students in New Mexico State University’s Doctor of Economic Development Program, which allows students to participate in internships at the branch. We have partnered with New Mexico State University to sponsor the Collegiate Advisory Board?an independent study program?and we have developed a Student Board of Directors program for the top high school students for the Las Cruces school district.\n\nCurrency processing, banking supervision, lending as a banker’s bank and public education efforts are integral parts of the Federal Reserve’s job. But you wouldn’t know it if you read the papers: They are not the parts of central banking that usually garner the most public attention. The sexier bits of what I do—to the extent anything in central banking is considered sexy—deal with monetary policy.\n\nThe presidents of the 12 Fed Banks, in addition to the five governors of the Federal Reserve Board (two shy of normal, thanks to a holdup in the nomination and confirmation process), normally meet every six weeks to discuss the current trajectory of the economy and craft the appropriate policy response. We do so in a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, commonly known as the FOMC. It is in these meetings that we set the base interest rate for interbank lending known as the federal funds, or “fed funds,” rate and where we develop other monetary policy initiatives, like the various programs we put in place to restore liquidity in the commercial paper and mortgage and other markets during the recent financial crisis.\n\nI come to each FOMC meeting armed with input from a research team that provides the intellectual heft for informed monetary policy making, as well as insights provided by board members, including Laura [Conniff] and Cindy [Ramos–Davidson], and the many businesses—large and small—that populate my district and with whom I constantly consult. The Dallas Fed employs a crack team of economists and analysts who study the local, national and international economies. Their work is top–notch. Few of you might know, for example, that Finn Kydland, an advisor to our research team in Dallas for the past 15 years, won the Nobel Prize in economics in 2004.\n\nThe FOMC is one of the few public service decisionmaking bodies in the world where members can come together and, in the span of only a few hours, present their positions without fear of political retribution and without posturing for the cameras, then hammer out agreement on a course of action based solely on what they solemnly consider judicious for the long–term health of the economy rather than for political convenience. On the afternoon in which we conclude our discussion, we craft a statement for public release explaining the actions taken. We release a lengthy set of minutes of our deliberations three weeks after our meeting.\n\nThe FOMC is where Texas and the parts of Louisiana and New Mexico that we cover have a voice at the policymaking table for the most powerful and essential central bank in the world. The president of the United States appoints and the Senate confirms the governors of the Federal Reserve System. The 12 Federal Reserve bankers like me who sit side by side with those governors are not subject to that process. We are hired and fired by nine–member boards of directors that represent the financial institutions and stakeholders and economic diversity of our respective districts. I want to make this clear: I am not accountable to any Washington politicos, be they Democrat or Republican. I am politically neutered, devoutly nonpartisan and guided solely by what I believe is the best way to craft policy so as to encourage sustainable economic growth with price stability, regardless of who is in the White House or the Congress. I work hard to represent the views and ideals of my part of the country. My fellow Bank presidents and I represent Main Street, not the Washington or Wall Street establishment. I want you to know that every time I speak or intervene in our policy discussion at the FOMC—which is quite often (I am, after all, a Texan)—I do so very much with that in mind.\n\nEconomic Overview\n\nWhich brings me to our current economic situation.\n\nDespite being hit with a variety of shocks last year and early this year, the economy continues to recover. Last year, concerns over the euro debt crisis and uncertainty over health and financial reform slowed the economy’s momentum during the summer. But the economy shook off those drags and reaccelerated late last year, reflecting a combination of policy stimulus and the ability of the U.S. economy to reinvigorate itself. More recently, bad winter weather and an increase in energy prices have sapped some steam from the recovery. Nevertheless, a host of more timely indicators suggest that economic growth will likely pick up in coming months.\n\nThe recovery in manufacturing and a bounceback in capital goods orders are particularly heartening. Not only do they contribute toward an economic recovery, but they are also harbingers of a needed rebalancing of our economy. During the credit boom of the prior decade, we became too dependent on consumption and housing for our economic growth. We borrowed too much, had unsustainable trade deficits and did not invest enough in business capital. The good news today is that we are making headway in shifting the mix of growth in our economy.\n\nOur manufacturing sector is recovering as we export more and as our entire economy invests more in equipment and software. In the long run, that will raise our productivity and our living standards. And that’s the kind of recovery that not only will restore jobs, but also will be more sustainable and will help bolster our standard of living.\n\nPrice Stability\n\nShifting to prices, we have seen inflationary impulses gaining ground both at home and abroad. An astute reader of today’s Wall Street Journal would have noted the article on page A12.[1] It reported the data released yesterday by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development?the OECD?showing that consumer prices in its 34 member countries rose 2.7 percent in the last 12 months, driven largely by food and energy prices. Of note, industrial producer prices in the European Union rose 6.7 percent year–over–year?the steepest annual increase since September 2008, just as the financial panic broke the back of the inflationary thrust that had been gaining steam throughout the summer of that year. At the core of the euro zone, Germany, where unemployment is actually lower than before the financial crisis, wage inflation is pressing up against 3 percent. Retail price inflation in the United Kingdom now exceeds 5 percent, despite very high unemployment. Reported inflation now exceeds 5 percent in China, 6 percent in Brazil and 10 percent in India.\n\nIn this country, as many of you have experienced firsthand, higher energy and commodity prices have reduced the purchasing power of many households. According to the latest readings, headline inflation increased at an annualized rate of 4.9 percent in March after clocking in at 5.1 percent in February.\n\nNumbers like these will make any central banker’s heart skip a beat, especially mine. Yet, here and abroad, a closer look at these numbers will reveal that energy and food prices?notoriously volatile items?make up a significant portion of this increase. This is not to say that these increases are unimportant; they are clearly worrisome, and we are following them closely. But our job as policymakers is to focus on underlying inflationary pressures, so as to avoid overemphasizing temporary volatility that might lead to faulty conclusions about the economy.\n\nThe question one should ask is: What is the best method to measure future inflationary trends? Headline inflation, important as it is in measuring the rise in someone’s cost of living, accurately characterizes past inflation but is not as informative as one might think for predicting future inflation. For that?counterintuitive as it might seem?it helps to exclude some of the more volatile components. This is why central bankers around the world pay such close attention to underlying measures rather than the headline number. Underlying price movements are more useful in predicting future inflationary trends.\n\nWe at the Dallas Fed came up with a separate and distinct way of calculating core inflation, called the trimmed mean analysis. Developed by senior economist Jim Dolmas, this measure looks at the price movements of 178 personal consumption expenditure items that matter to average consumers in a series that goes back to 1977. We then strip away both the highest and lowest monthly price increases for categories of goods and services to get at the underlying trend. This “trimmed–mean inflation rate” has become a key component in my economic toolkit, allowing me to better gauge the direction and speed of approaching inflationary winds.\n\nOver the past six months, the trimmed–mean inflation rate, while rising, has run at a somewhat sedate rate of 1.3 percent, though it has risen from a low of 0.7 percent in mid–2010. The 12–month inflation rate rose from a low of 0.8 percent in the second half of 2010 to 1.1 percent most recently. These numbers excluded items with extreme price increases, such as gasoline and many food items. We also trimmed out items with extreme price declines, such as toys, natural gas and wine. Among the items that were included to ascertain the underlying trend of prices were physician services, rent, tobacco, dining out, the costs of life and health insurance, sporting goods, guns and ammunition and child care costs. As the son of an Australian, I noted that the median item?the one smack in the middle?was beer! I also noted that the number of falling items in the basket has been declining to what has been a historically normal level of about 30 percent of items people consume. This trend in the number of items actually declining in price has been in place for a while, which is what convinced me early on that the risk of deflation was not as high as some of my other colleagues at the FOMC surmised.\n\nThe point is that, as of now, the higher gas and commodities prices have not translated into more general price inflation numbers. My gut, however, tells me that we must not become complacent on this front. We know from anecdotal soundings that American businesses, like businesses in other countries, are doing their utmost to offset with higher prices the surging costs of inputs such as fuel, other commodities and materials, and components, parts and processes sourced from abroad. As Chairman Ben Bernanke mentioned in his inaugural press conference last week, our job is to keep these from passing into prices and wages throughout the economy and creating a broader inflation. Such a result would be much more difficult, and painful, to extinguish.\n\nWe are committed to keeping inflation low and maintaining the credibility gained so painstakingly by former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker. I will remain steadfast in my resolve to keeping inflation low and stable. In monetary parlance, I am known as an inflation hawk?a description with which I am comfortable. As I have pointed out many times, ornithologists classify doves as being from the pigeon family, and I do not wish to be anybody’s pigeon. Nor am I alone in my firm commitment to keeping inflation under control. As Chairman Bernanke commented last week, if we are going to have success in creating a long–run sustainable recovery with lots of job growth, we must keep inflation under control. I am confident in our ability to do so.\n\nSo, bottom line: With regard to the economy, like the music of Wagner, the pace of economic growth may not be as bad as it sounds. With regard to inflation, like gangsta rap, it may not be as good as it sounds.\n\nTo counter the recession and ward off the risk of deflation, the Federal Reserve has provided a great deal of stimulus to the economy in the past few years. In my view, we have done as much as we can to supply the liquidity needed to restore economic growth. Now, as Ben Bernanke made clear in his press conference last week, we must remain sharply attuned to movements of underlying inflationary forces. Should it prove necessary to counter inflationary pressures, I will be among the first to advocate the unwinding of some of the stimulus we have provided and returning monetary policy to a more normal stance.\n\nThank you.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "April 8, 2011 Dallas, Texas\n\nIn the fall of 2006, I was asked to draw upon some 30 years of experience in Germany and speak at the American Academy in Berlin, addressing the question: “Is Germany’s Decline Exaggerated or Inevitable?”[1] This was against the backdrop of reforms that had been initiated by the former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, and carried on by his successor, Angela Merkel. I argued that Germany’s economic fate and position as primus inter pares in Europe was at a tipping point. The answer to the question of whether Germany was fated for decline or ascent depended upon how Germans would adapt their education system, labor laws, health care system, financial infrastructure, corporate governance, tax regime and myriad other changes needed to advance their economic competitiveness in a world being transformed by the forces of globalization and cyber-ization. I ended that speech by saying I was encouraged that changes had been initiated, but drew on St. Peter and Calvin Coolidge, neither of whom would have considered themselves economists, to underline the essential ingredient for success in these critical initiatives. For it was St. Peter who urged, “Be serious and discipline yourselves.”[2] And it was Silent Cal who said, “Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. …The slogan ‘press on’ has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.”\n\nTwo weeks ago, I was back in Germany. My interlocutors there, having been serious, determined and persistent in implementing change and who are now sitting rather pretty, turned the question back on me, asking: “Is America’s Decline Exaggerated or Inevitable?” I thought I would speak to that question today.\n\nFor those of you who are impatient, the answer is: “It depends.” It depends not upon the outcome of the conflicts in North Africa and the Middle East, nor upon the effect of the tsunami and the disruption of nuclear facilities in Japan, nor upon any of the other pressing issues of the moment that are the subject of day-to-day angst assiduously reported by your colleagues in the press.\n\nIt depends upon monetary and fiscal policy.\n\nIt depends upon whether the United States can get its economic house in order.\n\nIt depends, in the end, upon whether the Federal Reserve, as the nation’s central bank, and the Congress, working with the executive branch in discharging its duty as the nation’s fiscal authority, will adhere to the maxims of St. Peter and President Coolidge—whether each of these institutions has the will to be serious and discipline itself, and be persistent in pressing on with their respective duties.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nI’ll start with the Federal Reserve.\n\nIn contemplating future policy of the Federal Reserve, it is important to remember the frightful predicament we faced in the fall of 2008. The financial gears of our economy—the most powerful and important economy in the world—had ground to a halt. The entire panoply of markets for financial instruments essential to the daily lives of businesses and individual citizens—interbank lending, commercial paper, asset-backed lending, money-market mutual funds and the mortgage markets—seized up. In the blink of an eye, liquidity and trust in financial counterparties disappeared. In those darkest of days, a colleague of mine wittily summed up what had transpired by noting that on the balance sheets of the most important financial institutions, “nothing on the right is right and nothing on the left is left.”\n\nWe could have an endless discussion of who was responsible for this so-called black swan scenario. We would likely agree that it resulted from a combination of factors, including the speculative excesses that occur when interest rates remain too low for too long; the consequences of systemically important bank and financial intermediaries embracing risk-management tools that are formulaic and dependent upon “quant jocks” rather than upon common sense and good judgment; the abuses that ensue when regulatory authorities let down their guard; the comeuppance that inevitably occurs when policymakers and their advisers are lulled into complacency with theoretically comforting, but nonsensical, shibboleths like “efficient markets”; or just the financial tomfoolery that disturbingly repeats itself at periodic intervals throughout history when, in the memorable words written in 1856 by the English essayist Walter Bagehot, “[A]t particular times … people have a great deal of … money…. At intervals … the money of these people … is particularly large and craving: it seeks for some one to devour it, and there is [a] ‘plethora’; it finds some one, and there is ‘speculation’; it is devoured, and there is ‘panic.’”[3]\n\nRegardless of how it came to be, when the Panic of 2008 occurred, the Fed did what central banks are called to do when pandemonium strikes: As the lender of last resort, we stepped into the breach, used the powers given to us by our government to create money and credit, and deployed the considerable array of tools at our disposal to calm and restore the financial markets.[4]\n\nThe Bernanke-led Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had confidence in the programs we undertook, for they were well-vetted, disciplined and carefully considered. We persisted with them even though our actions gave rise to great consternation and warnings of bleak consequences from an understandably anxious Congress, skeptical financial pundits and frightened citizens. Teddy Roosevelt once said, “When people lose money, they strike out unthinkingly, like a wounded snake, at whoever is most prominent in the line of vision.”[5] The Fed—as the nation’s central bank and first responder to a financial crisis—was front and center in dealing with the panic, and we felt the sting of a rattled public and its elected representatives. Still, we “pressed on.”\n\nWe now know that the exigent measures we undertook worked. The end result of the Fed’s efforts was that the credit markets and the lifeblood of liquidity needed to conduct commerce and sustain the economy were restored. The economy responded and began a recovery in the middle of 2009 that is slowly gaining steam and now appears to be self-sustaining.\n\nImagine that! A government agency that (a) devised programs that actually worked, (b) shut most of them down when they had done their job and (c) made money for the taxpayer in the process.\n\nThis is not to say there was no cost to what we accomplished. There were trade-offs and unintended consequences, some of which were distinctly unpleasant.\n\nIn saving the system, for example, it can be argued that we protected imprudent lenders and investors from the consequences of their decisions; we rescued sinners and penalized the virtuous.\n\nPostcrisis, the “too big to fail” financial behemoths that had placed our economy in jeopardy have ended up with even greater financial power. (And, adding insult to injury, by the grace of their shareholders, most of their leaders retain their posts and few, if any, have suffered financial setbacks). This concentration of power comes at the expense of community and regional banks, an imbalance that the Federal Reserve and other authorities must now address through tough-minded, clear-eyed regulation.\n\nAt the individual citizen’s level, we eased the pain of overextended homeowners with mortgages by buying up $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities and driving mortgage rates to historic lows. The Fed’s interventions to drive interest rates to historically low levels resulted in significant capital gains for bondholders and equity investors in the most plain-vanilla securities and mutual funds. Yet, by taking interest rates to zero and making money cheap and abundant so as to reliquefy the economy, those who invested the most conservatively—tucking their savings away in the safest of vehicles, like CDs, money market funds, and Treasury bills and notes—saw the income earned on their hard-earned savings dramatically reduced.\n\nI personally fret over these and other costs, but on net, I believe the Federal Reserve did what is expected of a responsible central bank: We stemmed a panic and averted a depression.\n\nWhile we have wound down most all of our exigent programs, we remain with a bloated balance sheet, with footings in excess of $2.4 trillion, roughly triple the size of our precrisis balance sheet. And the composition of our balance sheet has changed: We hold about $937 billion in mortgage-backed securities and over $1.3 trillion in Treasury securities, including those of longer duration than is typical.\n\nWhen we buy an interest-bearing security from the market, we pay the seller of that security. This expands liquidity in the system. Whereas in the Panic there was no liquidity, today our large-scale asset purchases have made for abundant liquidity. Banks have $1.4 trillion in excess reserves parked in the 12 Federal Reserve Banks; other financial intermediaries are flush with cash; there is a surfeit of cash on the books of corporations and nonfinancial businesses, and more is available at little cost through a robust bond market and a fully recovered stock market.\n\nPersonally, I felt the liquidity needed to propel our economy forward was sufficient even before the FOMC opted last November to buy $600 billion in additional Treasuries on top of the committee’s pledge to replace the runoff of our $1.25 trillion mortgage-backed securities portfolio. I argued as much at the FOMC table. I considered the risk of deflation and of a double-dip recession to have receded into the rearview mirror. In fact, I gave an interview to my introducer here, Mr. [Brendan] Case, that was published under his byline in the Dallas Morning News on Aug. 26, 2009, in which I said the recession was over and the long slog of recovery from the Great Recession had begun.[6] Last November, I felt the problem was not the lack of liquidity in the economy, but that regulatory and fiscal uncertainty—the handiwork of fiscal authorities and lawmakers, not the Fed—was inhibiting the deployment of that liquidity into job creation. I also worried that these simultaneous programs would have the effect of buying up—of “monetizing”—the equivalent of most all of the U.S. government’s issuance of new debt through June of this year, a dangerous course for any central bank to embark upon.\n\nThe majority of my colleagues on the FOMC felt differently, and the committee voted to initiate the program now known as QE2. Whether you feel that we are providing a prudent amount of liquidity, as they do, or too much, as I do, I think you would be hard-pressed to dispute that there is now plenty of fuel in the tanks of American businesses to finance expansion and put unemployed and underemployed Americans back to work.\n\nHaving done our job, I see many risks to the Fed overstaying its welcome.\n\nThere are perceptional risks, for example. Our duty is most distinctly not to monetize—or even be perceived as monetizing—the debt of fiscally imprudent government. Throughout the history of nations, monetizing the budgetary excesses of governments has proven to be a direct path to economic perdition. Having already peeked inside that door, I feel strongly that we must now shut it, lock it and throw away the key.\n\nThere is the risk that we might breach our duty to hold inflation at bay. Inflationary impulses are gaining ground in the rest of the world. At the core of the euro zone, Germany, where unemployment is actually lower than before the crisis, wage inflation is pressing up against 3 percent. Retail price inflation in the United Kingdom now exceeds 5 percent, despite very high unemployment. Reported inflation now exceeds 4.5 percent in China, 6 percent in Brazil and 8 percent in India.\n\nWe know from anecdotal soundings that American businesses, like businesses in other countries, are doing their utmost to offset with higher prices the surging costs of inputs such as fuel, other commodities and materials, and components, parts and processes sourced from abroad. My gut tells me that this will result in some unpleasant general price inflation numbers in the next few reporting periods, even though the trimmed-mean inflation rate we calculate at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas—based on the price movements of 178 personal consumption expenditure items—while rising, has over the past six months run at a sedate rate of 1.2 percent.\n\nGiven that we still have significant excess capacity of unemployed workers, extremely subdued wage growth, strong productivity growth and weak domestic demand, one might reasonably posit that the general inflationary pressures we are experiencing presently are transitory. Nonetheless, adding still more liquidity, or not withdrawing in a timely manner what we already provided in abundance, would do nothing to quell emerging inflationary pressures and might well compound them, proving doubly injurious to savers and the earnings of those who do have jobs.\n\nAnd there is always the risk that, having provided so much liquidity, we might unwittingly abet a resurrection of the tomfoolery so well-described by Bagehot. Some disturbing practices are beginning to rear their ugly heads again: We have seen a resurgence of “covenant-lite” loans, with some $24 billion issued in the first quarter versus $100 billion for all of 2007; private-equity firms are back in size and turning to leverage to pay dividends; credit-boom acronyms most thought would never return after the Panic, such as “payment-in-kind,” or PIK, and “toggle” notes, are prominent once again; traditionally unleveraged asset managers, such as insurance companies and pension funds, are turning to leverage and exotic asset classes to juice returns. These are all signs of the intoxicating effects of the ambrosia of inexpensive and plentiful money. Further spiking the punch bowl with accommodative monetary policy would do nothing to rein them in.\n\nIn summarizing the monetary side of the equation, I would argue that the Federal Open Market Committee did its job. In the face of great skepticism and cynicism, we persisted and pressed on with doing what central banks are supposed to do to pull an economy back from the brink. We reliquefied the financial markets: Liquidity is no longer scarce. Money is no longer dear; it is cheap. Job-creating businesses have the financial means to get on with putting Americans back to work. Continued accommodation presents significant risks. In my view, no amount of further accommodation by the Fed would be wise—either by prolonging or “tapering off” the volume of purchases of Treasuries past June, or adding another tranche of large-scale asset purchases. Indeed, it may well be that we should consider curtailing what remains of QE2.\n\nNow, we at the Fed are nearing a tipping point. Just as we pressed on in doing our duty through extraordinary, exigent measures, we must now discipline ourselves to just as persistently normalize our operations in a timely way.\n\nFiscal Policy\n\nAs for the fiscal side of the equation, you know the story. I have been harping on this for years. I spoke of the dangers of what in polite parlance might be called the fiscal incontinence of Congress when I addressed the Commonwealth Club of California in May of 2008.[7] Under both Republican and Democratic leadership, past Congresses have created a fiscal sinkhole that is so deep and so wide, it threatens to swallow up our prosperity and render our economy an abattoir. They have forsaken the most sacred responsibility they have to successor generations of Americans: Instead of passing the torch to our children, they have passed them the bill.\n\nPast Congresses have made promises they cannot keep. Now, the new Congress is embarking on a corrective course. This is just the beginning of what I expect to be a long, arduous exercise. Here I evoke St. Peter: Congress, “be serious and discipline yourselves.” You have no choice but to go through a painful and gut-wrenching rehabilitation and begin leading a sober life of living within your means. You must press on with getting your accounts in order, however politically unpleasant it may be to do so.\n\nThis will be a titanic struggle. Our Congress must find a way to align spending with income through taxation that (a) does not cut off the incipient economic recovery, (b) provides a credible path toward bringing their accounts—including the unfunded liabilities of Medicare and Social Security—to solvency and (c) respects the fact that in a globalized, cyber-ized world, those with the ability to create jobs may create them in places that offer more compelling fiscal and regulatory environments.\n\nThis last point is not unimportant. Permanent jobs are created by the private sector. Businesses, large and small, publicly or privately held, have a duty to earn a return on investment for their shareholders. In a globalized, cyber-ized world, they need not invest or expand their payrolls in the United States; they are free to go practically anywhere on the planet. This is the result of one of our greatest accomplishments as a nation: We won the Cold War. Before the demise of the Soviet Union and the death of Mao, we lived in a world of mutually assured destruction; today, we live in a world of mutually assured competition. This is what we spent an entire generation of blood and national treasure to achieve. Now, those with the power to levy taxes and direct spending must get with it and adjust to the new world as they seek to incentivize job creation through businesses that, thanks to monetary policy, now have the financial means to put Americans back to work right here at home.\n\nThere cannot be robust direct investment in the United States without confidence in the nation’s ability to reverse its budgetary death spiral, especially the inexorable accumulation of national debt and unfunded liabilities of Medicare and Social Security. The need to break the back of that spiral is as dire now as was the need for Paul Volcker to break the back of inflation in the 1980s. Those who are leading the charge to restore fiscal sanity, be they Republican or Democrat, will no doubt recall the personal vitriol hurled at the then-Fed chairman; they should steel themselves against it. They should remember that, as a result of his steadfast determination to press on with exorcising inflation, Mr. Volcker is today among the most respected living Americans and widely considered an exemplar for public servants worldwide.\n\nGetting our fiscal house in order will not be an easy task. But there are worse alternatives. Resorting to protectionism or capital controls or sustained negative real interest rates or inflation, in lieu of real fiscal reform, would be pyrrhic solutions.[8] Corrupting the independence of the Fed would surely lead the nation to the same fate that befell Weimar Germany and Peron’s Argentina when their central banks took to monetizing debt. The nation cannot, must not, and, in my view, will not go down those sordid paths. Indeed, I sense we have turned the corner and are on the road to fiscal redemption, however bumpy it might be.\n\nMy German interlocutors asked why I am encouraged that we would now finally get on with the business of cleaning up our fiscal house. Central bankers are, after all, genetically programmed to be sourpusses; we are inherently wary of the capacity of politicians to be serious and discipline themselves.\n\nMy answer is admittedly emotional. I am the son of immigrants; my parents came to this country because it is the land of promise. Moreover, I am a naturalized Texan, and Texans are a persistent people who have always pressed on against the odds. The great historian of Texas, T.R. Fehrenbach, wrote that Texans understand that “men who exist get overrun by men who act.”[9] I believe deep in my heart that this is not unique to Texans—it is a quintessential American trait. I believe that the people of this great country will reward those members of Congress who act and will overrun those who exist only to encumber us with unsustainable debt and an imbalance of taxes and spending that threatens our prosperity rather than advances it. So, yes, I am hopeful that our elected leaders will get on the stick.\n\nBesides, I believe Winston Churchill had it right: “Americans can always be counted on to do the right thing … after they have exhausted all other possibilities.”\n\nThank you. In the best tradition of central bankers, I would be happy to avoid answering your questions.\n\n",

            "content": "March 7, 2011 Washington, D.C.\n\nWinston Churchill was in New York on Oct. 29, 1929, Black Thursday. Bernard Baruch took him to dinner that night with some 40 or so luminaries of finance—“friends and former millionaires,” Baruch called them. Churchill listened and, over the course of the evening and the next few days, took measure of the situation. He recorded his impression as follows: No one “could doubt that this financial disaster, huge as it is, cruel as it is to thousands, is only a passing episode in the march of a valiant…people who…are showing all nations much that they should attempt and much that they should avoid.” [1]\n\nThe historian Martin Gilbert later wrote that in the face of a fearful crisis, Churchill had seen the United States “at its most magnificent and its most tormented.” [2]\n\nMove the clock forward 82 years. We have no one on the world stage as eloquent as Churchill. But even the most prosaic observer might now be given to repeating the Last Lion’s observation: The financial disaster of 2008 and 2009 was huge. It was cruel not to thousands but to millions of Americans who lost their jobs and saw their savings and standard of living decimated. And yet, painful as it was—and remains for so many—it is proving to be a passing episode in the onward march of a valiant people.\n\nIn coping with the crisis and its aftermath, we have seen America at its most magnificent and its most tormented. We have shown others much that they should attempt and much that they should avoid.\n\nYou all know what transpired over the past few years, so let me give you an abridged version to set the stage of lessons learned and what I believe we now confront.\n\nDuring the recent Panic, the most important ingredient in the functioning of financial markets—trust in counterparties—imploded. The liquidity required to finance the business of America disappeared. Interbank lending evaporated. Risk premiums soared. The commercial paper market faltered. A hallmark money market fund “broke the buck.” Asset-backed security lending stopped cold. The entire spectrum of financing for businesses collapsed; the gears of the American economy went into reverse. Seemingly overnight, we were transformed from a grand vessel that had been sailing along on the tranquil sea of the Great Moderation into a battered wreck tossed about in a perfect storm threatening to dash us on the rocks of deflation, depression and ruin.\n\nEager to avoid the mistakes made by our predecessors during the 1930s, and led by an unassuming but determined chairman, the Federal Reserve created a panoply of programs to revive the key financial markets. In the face of widespread fear among businesses and the broader public, consternation among financial operators, and a great deal of breast beating by politicians threatening to compromise the independence that is so vital to operate a successful central bank, the Fed stepped into the breach. It did so in keeping with the ultimate duty of any central bank as lender of last resort: Drawing on emergency powers previously given us by the Congress, we addressed the exigent circumstances we faced by opening the floodgates to restore the credit markets and pull the economy back from the brink.\n\nThe long and short of it all was that the medicine applied by the Federal Reserve worked. Whereas, then there was no liquidity to finance our economy, now there is plenty: Money is cheap; banks and credit markets are flush; the stock market has soared. Financial wherewithal is widely available to businesses, public and private, that have the capacity to put the American people back to work.\n\nTo be sure, there are some, including me, who worry that the Fed ultimately may have taken out too much insurance against a double-dip recession and slippage into a deflationary spiral. There are some, including me, who argued against the last tranche of insurance we took out in committing to buy $600 billion in U.S. Treasuries between last November and the end of this coming June as we were simultaneously purchasing additional Treasuries to make up for the roll off in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio. There was a strong feeling among those of my policy persuasion that we had already sufficiently refilled the tanks holding the financial fuel businesses needed to drive their job-creating machines. They felt that by being too accommodative, we might run the risk of planting the seeds that could germinate into renewed volatility, speculation and inflation, or give comfort to a government that for far too many congressional cycles has fallen down on the job by spending and borrowing and committing to unfunded programs with reckless abandon.\n\nBut whether you feel that the Federal Reserve has gotten it just right or gone a bit beyond the call of duty, it is hard for anyone to argue that the Fed did not succeed in pulling the financial markets back from the brink and has successfully reliquefied the economy, restoring the flow of the vital lifeblood of commerce.\n\nIn an interview published in the Dallas Morning News on Aug. 26, 2009, I said the Great Recession was over but that the healing process would take time before gathering momentum and resulting in meaningful job creation.[3] (It took the National Bureau of Economic Research, or NBER, 15 months to reach the same conclusion,[4] leading one of my most prominent colleagues on the FOMC to quip: “And the NBER is expected to soon tell us that Christmas last year occurred on Dec. 25!”) We now know the economy bottomed in the second quarter of 2009 and has slowly been gaining momentum since then. As is evident in the latest round of data, a recovery is well under way.\n\nBy acting with purpose, I believe the Federal Reserve, in the words of Winston Churchill, did its part to show the world “much that should be attempted and much that they should avoid.” We demonstrated that a lender of last resort must avoid being timid in the face of a crisis. We showed our nation, and others who look to us for leadership, that central banks must act deliberately and conduct their duties doggedly, however intense the criticism or political heat. But we also revealed the price of acts of omission—that an institution ultimately responsible for maintaining financial stability can ill afford to be lax in its duties as a regulator and supervisor of systemically critical financial institutions under its jurisdiction—a failure we have taken significant organizational steps to correct and are working hard to avoid letting happen again.\n\nI happen to believe one of the best outcomes of the crisis is that the Fed demonstrated the importance of a central bank keeping its word. We said we would close the numerous emergency programs we engineered once they had done their job. And we have thus far done so. Imagine that: A government agency that (a) does what it says it will do; (b) actually closes down programs once they have served their purpose; and (c) not only does not lose taxpayer money in the process but makes a profit for the Treasury from it.\n\nYet, though the recovery is gaining strength, we still have a long and arduous path ahead of us. I managed a grin when I read the giddy headline on the release last Thursday of the latest survey of the National Federation of Independent Business: In bold capital letters it proclaimed, “Whoo Hooo. Best Job Creation Number in 3 Years!!” [5] But I suppressed a more fulsome smile. The news is better; job creation is gathering momentum; the economy is moving in the right direction. But it is worrisomely clear that the task of putting millions of unemployed and underemployed Americans back to work will take an anguishing amount of time.\n\nI do not, however, feel that further monetary accommodation will speed the process. It might well retard job creation, should it give rise to inflationary expectations or, worse, imply that, having suffered the slings and arrows of popular and political contempt as we went about doing what we did to save the financial system, we have now been compromised and become a pliant accomplice to Congress’ and the executive branch’s fiscal misfeasance. I am wary of those risks. Indeed, as a voting member of the FOMC this year, I have made clear within the meeting room and in public speeches that, barring some frightful development, I will vote against any program that might seek to extend or enlarge the substantial monetary accommodation we already have provided, just as I argued against the $600 billion extension the voters on the Committee approved last November. And I remain doubtful enough as to its efficacy that if at any time between now and June, it should prove demonstrably counterproductive, I will vote to curtail or perhaps discontinue it. As I said, the liquidity tanks are full, if not brimming over. The Fed has done its job. What is needed now is for business to be incentivized to commit that liquidity to creating American jobs. This is the task of the fiscal authorities, not the Federal Reserve.\n\nHere, I see the America that Churchill described as being “at its most magnificent and its most tormented.”\n\nThe backbone of our economy, private business, is magnificently lean and fit. American business operators began to trim down and shape up their operating efficiency during the inflationary scare that threatened their profits running up to the summer of 2008. When the wheels came off the bus that fall and demand collapsed, they drove themselves to still greater efficiency to preserve their bottom lines or just to survive. The most expensive cost for most all businesses is labor. Over the past cycle, American businesses have learned to use the least amount of workers to drive the most amount of productivity. Today, our economy produces as much output as it did in 2007 before the onset of the crisis. But it uses over 7 million fewer workers to do so. From an economic standpoint, this efficiency is, indeed, a magnificent thing. And yet widespread unemployment is tormenting our society. The vexing question is: How will millions of Americans be put back to work in timely fashion?\n\nAll business operators, public or private, large or small, have a duty to their shareholders or their creditors to earn the highest return on investment possible. In a globalized economy, they can go anywhere on earth to do so. They can invest in China. Or India. Or Vietnam or Singapore or Brazil or Mexico or Africa. Or anywhere in an expanded, post-Cold War Europe. Nothing short of the poison of capital controls or protectionism can prevent them from doing so. Which raises the question: What must now be done to get businesses to invest in job creation here at home with the cheap and abundant money the Fed has made possible?\n\nThe obvious answer is that they must have confidence in the future of America. Businesses, like any other economic actor, will respond to immediate tax and regulatory incentives. But to make long-term investment decisions that create permanent, remunerative jobs they must have confidence in the long-term prospects of where they invest. In my judgment, it will be hard to secure that needed comfort until Congress makes clear it will refrain from the errant fiscal ways of the past, changes the way it taxes and spends and regulates, and places the nation demonstrably, and unalterably, on a path of fiscal rectitude.\n\nI was quoted in the Washington Post on Feb. 21 as saying that we had suffered for too long from “Lindsay Lohan” Congresses.[6] Like Ms. Lohan, the American Congress is a beautiful creation, blessed with enormous talent. But it has been waylaid by addiction—in the case of the Congress to spending and debt—and by a proclivity for shoplifting—in the case of the Congress to pocketing for their immediate gratification the economic future of our children and grandchildren and our grandchildren’s children.\n\nReasonable arguments can be made that fiscal policy must loosen during cyclical downturns to provide an economic environment conducive to growth. Some economic research even points to deficit spending as an essential ingredient for recovery when interest rates are near the so-called zero bound or the Fed has reached the limit of prudent monetary accommodation through other means. We certainly have put that theory to the test during the past two fiscal years, running deficits of $1.3 trillion in 2010 and an expected $1.65 trillion in 2011.\n\nWhat’s troubling about the fiscal situation, however, is the likelihood of persistent large yearly deficits long after the current recession is behind us. The same economic theory that prescribes deficits during recession prescribes surpluses during recovery to help meet the next economic challenge that might develop. If current deficits were exclusively due to cyclical phenomena, one would expect to see surpluses as we distance ourselves from the Great Recession we have just experienced. Instead, as far as the eyes of the analysts at the Office of Management and Budget can see, deficits will remain slightly above the 3 percent GDP threshold at which it is feared significant crowding-out of private sector economic activity begins to appear.[7] And other observers, under less optimistic assumptions, foresee significantly higher deficits in the years ahead.\n\nThe U.S. economy is afflicted with the pathology of structural deficits. This leaves the nation poorly positioned to weather the next recession or shock to come our way. I devoutly hope our next downturn won’t come for quite some time, but it surely will come eventually. Will we follow the lead of the biblical Joseph, storing fiscal grain during boom times in preparation for the lean times that will, inevitably, someday follow? Or will we take the opposite course and run larger-than-normal deficits every year, hindering our ability to respond when the current expansion ends or an unforeseen crisis occurs, thereby undermining the confidence needed by businesses to commit sustainable job-creating capital here at home?\n\nIt is important to note that institutionalized deficits are cruelest to future generations. What has made the United States an exceptional economic haven for investment and growth has been the certain knowledge that the successor generation would enjoy a better standard of living than the current one—that ever-expanding prosperity was built into the system. Encumbering future generations with debt dashes that promise. Instead of passing the torch of prosperity to the successor generation, the fiscal authorities have been passing them the bills. If our Congress continues to provide more in services than they are willing to collect in taxes, it is a mathematical certainty that the well-being of our progeny will suffer. Correcting this pernicious dynamic is imperative for assuring our economic future.\n\nIt is not the job of the Federal Reserve to conduct fiscal policy. It is not for me or any other Federal Reserve official to advise Congress on particular tax or expenditure choices. Yet the overall stance of fiscal policy is very much relevant to monetary policymakers. A large and growing government debt inevitably places pressure on the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates too low for too long, making it more difficult for the Fed to fulfill its dual mandate of price stability and full employment.\n\nThroughout history, feckless governments have dodged their fiscal responsibility by turning to their monetary authority to devalue the currency, monetize debt and inflate their way out of structural deficits. If we are to live up to Churchill’s charge to show the world what must be avoided, the world’s foremost central bank—keeper of the premier reserve currency and bulwark against its debasement—cannot, and must not, ever succumb to such pressure. It is thus best for everyone—future generations and the current one alike—that our fiscal leaders not go there. For such an action would precipitate a showdown that would be anything but “magnificent” to behold. Congress and the executive branch thus have no choice but to now suck it up, make some painful choices and get on with the business of putting our valiant nation on a more sustainable fiscal course. I, for one, am pleased to see that a dialogue toward this end has begun. Let us hope it results in meaningful action.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "February 8, 2011 Dallas, Texas\n\nIt is a great pleasure to speak to the Stemmons Corridor Business Association. I had the good fortune of knowing John Stemmons. He was one of my father-in-law’s closest friends, and his son, Johnny, who was taken from us way too early in life, was a cherished friend of mine. Mr. Stemmons looked like John Wayne and had the business acumen of Trammell Crow, who, as many of you know, was an early business partner of John’s. Without John Stemmons, Trammell Crow could never have developed the Trade Mart and all of his other innovative concepts that helped the Stemmons Corridor and Dallas become vital economic hubs.\n\nOnly John Stemmons would have had the foresight to donate 100 acres of recovered flood plain to the people of Texas, saving the state the cost of acquisition of a vital transportation artery and allowing him to develop this corridor into the great property it became. He was a giant of a man and an exemplary proponent of the free-market capitalism that made our city and our state and our country great.\n\nIt is somehow fitting that you asked me to speak here today, just two days after the 100th celebration of Ronald Reagan’s birthday. Old John Stemmons loved President Reagan. In 1984, the Republican convention was held here in Dallas. My father-in-law, Congressman Jim Collins, was also a good friend of the president. During the convention, Mr. Collins invited me to join Mr. Stemmons and a handful of their friends to visit with Mr. Reagan. The president was in remarkable form and, great raconteur that he was, told this story:\n\nPaddy McCoy, an elderly Irish farmer, received a letter from the Department for Works and Pensions stating that he was suspected of not paying his employees the statutory minimum wages and that an inspector would be sent to the farm.\n\nOn the appointed day, the inspector turned up. “Tell me about your staff,” he asked of Paddy.\n\n“Well,” said Paddy, “there is the farmhand. I pay him 240 a week and he has use of a free cottage.”\n\n“That’s good,” said the inspector.\n\n“Then there’s the housekeeper. She gets 190 a week, along with free board and lodging.”\n\n“That sounds fine,” said the inspector.\n\nPaddy went on. “There’s also the half-wit. He works a 16-hour day, does 90 percent of the work, nets about 25 pounds a week when all is said and done, but takes down a bottle of whiskey and, as a special treat, occasionally gets to sleep with my wife.”\n\n“That’s disgraceful, Paddy,” said the inspector. “I need to interview the half-wit.”\n\n“Well,” said Paddy, “you’re looking at him.”\n\nJohn Stemmons laughed so hard he cried. As rich and as prominent as he was, he identified with the Paddy McCoys of the world. He took delight in doing things as independently as possible; he was a great example of individual initiative in a world that has become increasingly dependent on government intervention and what we have come to know as an “inside the Beltway” mentality—a mentality that too often fails to grasp the essence and magic of Stemmons-like entrepreneurship that is the hallmark of American success.\n\nI am going to take advantage of this platform to remind you that the Federal Reserve System is uniquely structured to balance “inside the Beltway” influences with “outside the Beltway” thinking. The governors of the Fed in Washington are appointed by the president of the United States and confirmed by the Senate. The 12 bank presidents, like me, who operate the System in the field and also sit on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) with the Fed governors, are not. Instead, we are selected by, and serve at the pleasure of, boards of directors drawn from the citizenry of our districts. Herb Kelleher, the founder of Southwest Airlines, is the current chairman of the Dallas Fed board, which includes eight others ranging from Renu Khator, the dynamic president of the University of Houston, to Joe Kim King, a goat rancher who is the CEO of Brady National Bank, a rural bank with $80 million in footings.\n\nAs a Federal Reserve Bank president, I play a dual role under the watchful eye of my board of directors. I am the CEO of a $100 billion Bank that lends and provides cash to and supervises and regulates local banks. We provide myriad services to the 27 million people who populate 360,000 square miles of Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico—27 million hardy citizens whose economic output exceeds the output of Australia and is only slightly less than that of India.\n\nOn the policy front, my job is to bring a Main Street perspective to the table. When I was asked by the Dallas Fed board six years ago to become president of the Bank, I met with Alan Greenspan. I asked the Chairman how I could best serve the System. His answer was crisp: “Just speak to the truth,” he said.\n\nJohn Stemmons would have given me the same advice.\n\nSo today, I will speak to the truth as I see it. As I always do, I speak only for myself and my colleagues at the Dallas Fed and not for anybody else on the FOMC or elsewhere in the System. I suspect this will immediately become clear.\n\nOnly a month ago, a new Congress was sworn in. New leadership took office in the Lower House, with the new speaker saying, “The American people have humbled us. … They have reminded us that everything is on loan from them.”[1] The Senate retained its leadership but underwent a sea change in its composition.\n\nAt the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, the White House revealed significant staff changes while also announcing a new attitude toward the business community. The administration pledged to clear the underbrush that hampers businesses’ job creation by rooting out laws and regulations that, in the words of the president, “are just plain dumb,” and by vowing to now bring federal spending under control.[2]\n\nThe new Congress and the new staff in the White House have their work cut out for them. You cannot overstate the gravity of their duty on the economic front. Over the years, their predecessors—Republicans and Democrats together—have dug a fiscal sinkhole so deep and so wide that, left unrepaired, it will swallow up the economic future of our children, our grandchildren and their children. They must now engineer a way out of that frightful predicament without thwarting the nascent economic recovery.\n\nI have been outspoken about the limits of monetary policy as a salve for the nation’s fiscal pathology.[3] The Fed has done much, as I see it, to provide the bridge financing until the new Congress gets to work restructuring the tax and regulatory incentives American businesses need to confidently expand their payrolls and capital expenditures here at home.[4]\n\nThe Federal Reserve has held short-term interest rates to nil. We have expanded our balance sheet to unprecedented levels, with the effect of holding down mortgage rates and the rate of interest paid on Treasuries and the myriad financial instruments that are priced off of Treasuries, including corporate debt. After much debate—which included strong concern expressed by one member with a formal vote and others, like me, who did not have voting rights in 2010—the FOMC collectively decided in November to temporarily undertake a program to purchase U.S. Treasuries that, when added to previous policy initiatives, roughly means we will be purchasing the equivalent of all newly issued Treasury debt through June.\n\nBy this action, we have run the risk of being viewed as an accomplice to Congress’ fiscal nonfeasance. To avoid that perception, we must vigilantly protect the integrity of our delicate franchise. There are limits to what we can do on the monetary front to provide the bridge financing to fiscal sanity. The head of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, said it best recently while speaking in Germany: “Monetary policy responsibility cannot substitute for government irresponsibility.”[5]\n\nThe entire FOMC knows the history and the ruinous fate that is meted out to countries whose central banks take to regularly monetizing government debt. Barring some unexpected shock to the economy or financial system, I think we are pushing the envelope with the current round of Treasury purchases. I would be very wary of expanding our balance sheet further; indeed, given current economic and financial conditions, it is hard for me to envision a scenario where I would not use my voting position this year to formally dissent should the FOMC recommend another tranche of monetary accommodation. And I expect I will be at the forefront of the effort to trim back our Treasury holdings and tighten policy at the earliest sign that inflationary pressures are moving beyond the commodity markets and into the general price stream. I am a veteran of the Carter administration and know how easily prices can spin out of control and how cruelly markets can exact their revenge. I would not want to relive that experience.\n\nBut here is the essential fact I want to emphasize and have you think about today: The Fed could not monetize the debt if the debt were not being created by Congress in the first place.\n\nThe Fed does not create government debt; Congress does. Deficits and the unfunded liabilities of Medicare and Social Security are not created by the Federal Reserve; they are the legacy of Congress. The Fed does not earmark taxpayer money for pet projects in local communities that taxpayers themselves would never countenance; only the Congress does that. The Congress and administration play the dominant role in creating the regulatory environment that incentivizes or discourages job creation.\n\nIt seems to me that those lawmakers who advocate “Ending the Fed” might better turn their considerable talents toward ending the fiscal debacle that has for too long run amuck within their own house.\n\nA look within the United States makes clear the overriding influence of fiscal and regulatory policy. Monetary policy is uniform across the 50 states; the base rate of interest paid on a business or consumer loan or a mortgage in Michigan, California, Ohio or New York is the same as that paid in Texas. Yet there is a reason that Michigan and California each lost more than 600,000 jobs over the past decade while Texas added more than 700,000 over the same period. There is a reason that the population of Ohio grew by only 183,000 residents over the past 10 years, while Texas grows by that number every five and a half months. There is a reason that with each passing census, the state of New York has been losing congressional seats and Texas has been adding them; a reason that, in the recent census, California failed to gain any while Texas gained four. There is a reason that, as documented in the Jan. 12 issue of the Wall Street Journal, college graduates—the best and brightest of the successor generation—are leaving New York and Cleveland and Detroit and moving to Austin, Texas.[6] There is a reason no state in the union houses more Fortune 500 headquarters than Texas. There is a reason for the disparate employment growth that has taken place in the 12 Federal Reserve districts over the past two decades, data that are documented in the graph at your place setting.\n\n\n\nThat reason has nothing to do with monetary policy. It has everything to do with the taxation and fiscal and regulatory policies of the states. The cost of capital does not explain the different economic performances of the states; the cost of doing business has everything to do with those differences. However well-meaning tax and regulatory initiatives in the laggard states may have been when they were conceived and levied, they have had unintended consequences that have led to economic underperformance and job destruction.\n\nSimilarly, the key to correcting the underperformance of the American economy and American job creation does not presently rest with the Federal Reserve. It is in the hands of those who make fiscal and regulatory policy.\n\nThe Fed has reduced the cost of business borrowing to the lowest levels in decades. It has seen to it that liquidity is widely available to banks and businesses. It has kept the economy from deflating and it has kept inflation under control. This has helped raise the economic tide. Recent data make clear that the risks of a double-dip recession and deflation have ebbed and that economic growth and job creation are beginning to flow. Yet the ships of job-creating investment remain, with some exceptions, tied to the docks—or worse, are choosing to sail for foreign ports where tax and regulatory conditions are more favorable, very much in the same way that Ohio, Michigan, New York and California businesses and workers have navigated to Texas.\n\nU.S. nonfarm payrolls fell by 8.75 million jobs from their peak in January 2008 to their trough in February 2010. Estimates are that the population of Americans of working age increased by 4.4 million during the same period, creating a shortfall of over 13 million jobs. Since February 2010, the shortfall has only gotten worse: Although employers have added approximately 1 million new jobs, the working-age population has increased by an additional 1.7 million. All in all, we have approximately 6 million more people of working age than we did when the recession began—and a net loss of 7.7 million jobs. Divining policies that will encourage the private sector to increase hiring by enough to make up some of this lost ground is both an urgent and a daunting task.\n \nI don’t believe the Fed is constraining job creation. None of my business contacts, large or small, publicly held or private, are complaining about the cost of borrowing, the lack of liquidity or the availability of capital. Just this morning at 7:30, for example, the National Federation of Independent Business released results from a survey of 2,144 randomly selected small businesses. It said, “Ninety-two percent [of those surveyed] reported that all their credit needs were met or that they were not interested in borrowing.”[7]\n\nA recent Wells Fargo/Gallup Small Business Index survey reports that about 80 percent of those who were reluctant to hire said they were afraid revenues wouldn’t increase enough to justify the expense.[8] The problem is not the availability of credit. The problem for businesses, small or large, is generating enough final sales at a profit; the need is for revenue that exceeds the expense of incurring that revenue.\n\nYou can’t have stronger sales if you don’t have stronger job creation. We will not have robust job creation until businesses are confident they can earn a good return on the investment they must make to add new workers. Employers live in a world in which they are free to invest their monies in expanding operations and hiring workers anywhere in the world, in any place they have the best opportunity to earn a superior return on investment. This is one of the legacies of the Reagan era—of having won the Cold War and having the majority of previously closed or dysfunctional governments choose prosperity as their goal rather than the economic suppression of their people. To achieve that prosperity, they need job-creating investment. To attract that investment, they provide incentives through tax and regulatory incentives and other means.\n\nWhereas before we lived in a world of mutually assured destruction, we now live in a world of mutually assured competition. We have no choice but to create the conditions that incent businesses that operate in the United States to compete using American workers. This requires rethinking by Congress—the sole body with the power to shape our nation’s taxes and spending and write regulatory laws to condition economic activity. Our lawmakers must do so in a manner that both stimulates the desire of businesses to put Americans back to work at the earliest opportunity and provides meaningful assurance that long-term fiscal imbalances they have wrought will be brought under control, assuring the long-term viability of the U.S. economy.\n\nBefore the recent mid-term election, most all of my business contacts claimed that taxes, regulatory burdens and the lack of understanding in Washington of what incentivizes private-sector job creation were inhibiting the expansion of their payrolls. They felt stymied by a Congress and an executive branch that have appeared to them to be unaware of, if not outright opposed to, what fires the entrepreneurial spirit. Many felt that opportunities for earning a better and more secure return on investment are larger elsewhere than here at home.\n\nPerhaps because I live so far outside the Beltway—among the Washington-skeptical, independent-minded people of the Eleventh Federal Reserve District—I was therefore not surprised by the outcome of the recent election. As I watched it unfold, I thought of one of the better books I had read in the summer of 1998, at the recommendation of a friend, the eminent historian David McCullough. It was titled Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World, written by Mark Kurlansky, and was considered by the New York Public Library to be “one of the 25 best books of the year.”[9]\n\nBuried in the middle of that remarkable little book is a wonderful description of the causes of the American Revolution. Kurlansky wrote that “Massachusetts radicals sought an economic, not a social, revolution. They were not thinking of the hungry masses. … They were thinking of the right of every man to be middle-class, to be an entrepreneur, to conduct commerce and make money.” Referring to John Adams, John Hancock and John Rowe—everyone seemed to be named John in New England in those days—he posited that the revolution “was about political freedom.” “But,” he went on, “in the minds of its most hard-line revolutionaries, the New England radicals, the central expression of that freedom was the ability to make their own decisions about their own economy.” He concluded that “all revolutions are to some degree about money,” reminding the reader that, reflecting upon France’s revolution, the Comte de Mirabeau said, “In the last analysis the people will judge the Revolution by this fact alone [sic] … Are they better off? Do they have more work? And is that work better paid?”[10]\n\nWe now have a new, younger and—in the sense depicted by Kurlansky—more radical Congress working alongside a president as they seek to craft policies more responsive to the message given by the electorate. The new Congress was elected to cast off the status quo of what many have come to feel is excessive encroachment upon the people’s freedom to make their own decisions about the economy. To do so successfully, this new, radical Congress and newly inspired president had better bear in mind Count Mirabeau’s analysis. The people of the United States will judge them not by their rhetoric, not by their declarations, proclamations and statements of intent, but by whether their policies result in a people who are better off, have more work and are better paid.\n\nThe leaders of our government cannot attempt to talk their way out of the problem like their predecessors did. Or string out needed remedies until after the next election. They must fix the problem now. If they fail to do so, then the election, for all its hoopla, will prove to have been nothing more than a case of putting old, rancid wine in new bottles.\n\nTheirs is not an easy task. We have all become used to the false comfort of having government coddle us, whether we are rich businesses receiving subsidies or poor citizens sustained by government largesse. The election tapped into a foreboding sense that the cost of that comfort now exceeds its benefits, as manifest in looming mega-deficits, deep if not unfathomable unfunded liabilities, egregious abuse of fiscal powers symbolized by earmarks, and other methods used by politicians to grease the skids of their reelection.\n\nTapping into that foreboding in the recent election was the easy part. Talk of reform is cheap. Enacting reform will be painful.\n\nA reader of Shakespeare will recall the dialogue between Glendower and Hotspur in Henry IV. Glendower claims, “I can call spirits from the vasty deep.” And Hotspur replies, “Why, so can I, or so can any man; But will they come when you do call for them?”[11]\n\nWe shall see if the new Congress will prove worthy of the power the American people have “loaned” them, and, together with the president, actually draw the spirits of fiscal reform and sanity from the “vasty deep” to at long last implement meaningful fiscal and regulatory policy that incentivizes private-sector job creation here at home while arresting the hemorrhaging of our Treasury. If they do, then more Americans will find work and be better off, better paid and freer to make their own decisions about the economy.\n\nIf they don’t, then woe to our children, their children and the American Dream.\n\nI am tempted to end this cheery talk by saying, “Have a nice day!” and walking off the stage. However, I would hate to leave this podium with your having concluded that I am just another central bank curmudgeon. I am professionally programmed to worry. Like John Stemmons, I am also a red-blooded American, as are all my colleagues at the Fed. I draw on the wisdom of Marcus Nadler, one of the great minds of the Federal Reserve from a period when our economy endured an even more dire test. To counter the intellectual paralysis and down-in-the-mouth pessimism that gripped the financial industry after the Great Depression, Nadler put forth four simple propositions:\n\nFirst, he said: “You’re right if you bet that the United States economy will continue to expand.”\nSecond: “You’re wrong if you bet that it is going to stand still or collapse.”\nThird: “You’re wrong if you bet that any one element in our society is going to ruin or wreck the country.”\nAnd fourth: “You’re right if you bet that [leaders] in business, labor and government are sane, reasonably well informed and decent people who can be counted on to find common ground among all their conflicting interests and work out a compromise solution to the big issues that confront them.”\n\nThis became known as Old Doc Nadler’s Remedy, and for my part, it is spot on. Every one of us preoccupied with what ails us should keep it in mind.\n\nIt may seem like the stuff of our wildest dreams to imagine getting ourselves out of the current nightmarish predicament. But I believe we can and we will. We are Americans. When put to the test, Americans rise to the occasion, no matter how great the challenge. We have done it time and again. We have no choice but to do it once more.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "January 12, 2011 New York City\n\nI am delighted to speak here in the hallowed halls of the Harvard Club of New York City. I have been a member of this club for over 35 years. I love its sturdy facilities, its history, the trophies from Teddy Roosevelt’s African expedition of 1909–10 and … its mustiness.\n\nThe thing I prize most about this facility is that the rooms here are cheap. As I did last night, I always stay in what used to be called a “dorm room,” one of the little rooms smack in the middle of this old building. These rooms are sparsely furnished, with only a sink and a bed and the smallest imaginable armoire jammed into approximately 130 square feet. I like them because there are no better-priced rooms in New York City. And because they are stone quiet. They are the only hotel rooms I know of in the city where the occupants cannot hear the grinding noise of trash trucks … when trash is actually being collected.\n\nI am especially honored that both the Manhattan Institute and e21 are sponsoring this speech today.[1] Thank you, David [Malpass] for taking time out of your busy schedule to introduce me.\n\nThe Manhattan Institute and e21 are powerful proponents of the free-market capitalism that made our country the richest and the most successful democracy in the history of humankind. I took note of the institute’s claim on its website that it sponsors thinking “literally and figuratively outside the Beltway.” That’s a good thing. The Federal Reserve is structured to balance “inside the Beltway” influences with “outside the Beltway” thinking.

I speak only for myself and my colleagues at the Dallas Fed and not for anybody else on the FOMC or elsewhere in the System. I suspect this will immediately become clear.\n\nFiscal Matters\n\nA week ago today, a new Congress was sworn in. New leadership took office in the Lower House, with the new speaker saying, “The American people have humbled us. … They have reminded us that everything is on loan from them.”[2] The Senate retained its leadership but underwent a sea change of composition.\n\nAt the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, the White House announced significant staff changes, among them bringing in a highly respected former administration colleague from my days as a trade negotiator to be the president’s chief of staff.[3]\n \nThe new Congress and the new staff in the White House have their work cut out for them.

After much debate—which included strong concern expressed by one member with a formal vote and others, like me, who did not have voting rights in 2010—the FOMC collectively decided in November to temporarily undertake a program to purchase U.S. Treasuries that, when added to previous policy initiatives, roughly means we are purchasing the equivalent of all newly issued Treasury debt through June.\n\nBy this action, we have run the risk of being viewed as an accomplice to Congress’ fiscal nonfeasance. To avoid that perception, we must vigilantly protect the integrity of our delicate franchise. There are limits to what we can do on the monetary front to provide the bridge financing to fiscal sanity. Last Friday, speaking in Germany, [European Central Bank President] Jean-Claude Trichet said it best: “Monetary policy responsibility cannot substitute for government irresponsibility.”[6]\n\nThe entire FOMC knows the history and the ruinous fate that is meted out to countries whose central banks take to regularly monetizing government debt. Barring some unexpected shock to the economy or financial system, I think we have reached our limit. I would be wary of further expanding our balance sheet. But here is the essential fact I want to emphasize today: The Fed could not monetize the debt if the debt were not being created by Congress in the first place.\n\nThose lawmakers who advocate “Ending the Fed” might better turn their considerable talents toward ending the fiscal debacle that has for too long run amuck within their own house. The Fed does not create government debt; fiscal authorities do. Deficits and the unfunded liabilities of Medicare and Social Security are not created by the Federal Reserve; they are the legacy of those who control the purse strings—the Congress, working with the president. The Fed does not earmark taxpayer money for pet projects in local communities that taxpayers themselves would never countenance; only the Congress does that. The Congress and administration play the dominant role in creating the regulatory environment that incentivizes or discourages job creation.\n\nA look within the United States makes clear the overriding influence of fiscal and regulatory policy. Monetary policy is uniform across the 50 states; the base rate of interest paid on a business or consumer loan or a mortgage in Michigan, California, Ohio or here in New York is the same as that paid in Texas. Yet there is a reason that Michigan and California each lost more than 600,000 jobs over the past decade while Texas added more than 700,000 over the same period. There is a reason that the population of Ohio grew by only 183,000 residents over the past 10 years, while Texas grows by that number every five and a half months. There is a reason that with each passing census, the state of New York has been losing congressional seats and Texas has been adding them; a reason that, in the recent census, California failed to gain any while Texas gained four. There is a reason that, as reported in this morning’s Wall Street Journal, college graduates—the best and brightest of the successor generation—are leaving New York and Cleveland and Detroit and moving to Austin, Texas.[7] There is a reason Texas now houses more Fortune 500 headquarters than any other state in the union. There is an underlying reason behind the graph placed before you that charts the disparate employment growth that has taken place in the 12 Federal Reserve districts over the past two decades.\n\n\n\nThat reason has nothing to do with monetary policy. It has everything to do with the taxation and fiscal and regulatory policies of the states. The cost of capital does not explain the different economic performances of the states; the cost of doing business has everything to do with those differences. However well-meaning tax and regulatory initiatives in the laggard states may have been when they were conceived and levied, they have had unintended consequences that have led to economic underperformance and job destruction.\n\nSimilarly, the key to correcting the underperformance of the American economy and American job creation does not rest with the Federal Reserve. It is in the hands of those who make fiscal and regulatory policy.\n\nThe Fed has reduced the cost of business borrowing to the lowest levels in decades. It has seen to it that liquidity is widely available to banks and businesses. It has kept the economy from deflating and it has kept inflation under control. This has helped raise the economic tide. Recent data make clear that the risks of a double-dip recession and deflation have ebbed and that economic growth and job creation are beginning to flow. Yet the ships of job-creating investment remain, for the most part, tied to the docks—or worse, choose to sail for foreign ports where tax and regulatory conditions are more favorable, very much in the same way that Ohio, Michigan, New York and California businesses and workers have navigated to Texas.\n\nI don’t believe this has much to do with the Fed. None of my business contacts, large or small, publicly held or private, are complaining about the cost of borrowing, the lack of liquidity or the availability of capital. All express concern about taxes, regulatory burdens and the lack of understanding in Washington of what incentivizes private-sector job creation. All are stymied by a Congress and an executive branch that have appeared to them to be unaware of, if not outright opposed to, what fires the entrepreneurial spirit. Many have begun to feel that opportunities for earning a better and more secure return on investment are larger elsewhere than here at home.\n\nThe Recent Election\n\nPerhaps because I live so far outside the Beltway—among the Washington-skeptical, independent-minded people of the Eleventh Federal Reserve District—I was not surprised by the outcome of the recent election. As I watched it unfold, I thought of one of the better books I had read in the summer of 1998, at the recommendation of a friend, the eminent historian David McCullough. It was titled Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World, written by Mark Kurlansky, and was considered by the New York Public Library to be “one of the 25 best books of the year.”[8]\n\nBuried in the middle of that remarkable little book is a wonderful description of the causes of the American Revolution. Kurlansky wrote that “Massachusetts radicals sought an economic, not a social, revolution. They were not thinking of the hungry masses. … They were thinking of the right of every man to be middle-class, to be an entrepreneur, to conduct commerce and make money.”[9] Referring to John Adams, John Hancock and John Rowe—everyone seemed to be named John in New England in those days—he posited that the revolution “was about political freedom.” “But,” he went on, “in the minds of its most hard-line revolutionaries, the New England radicals, the central expression of that freedom was the ability to make their own decisions about their own economy.”[10] He concluded that “all revolutions are to some degree about money,” reminding the reader that, reflecting upon France’s revolution, the Comte de Mirabeau said, “In the last analysis the people will judge the Revolution by this fact alone [sic] … Are they better off? Do they have more work? And is that work better paid?”[11]\n\nWe now have a new, younger and—in the sense depicted by Kurlansky—more radical Congress working alongside a president as they seek to craft policies more responsive to the message given by the electorate. The new Congress was elected to cast off the status quo of what many have come to feel is excessive encroachment upon the people’s freedom to make their own decisions about the economy. To do so successfully, this new, radical Congress and newly inspired president had better bear in mind Count Mirabeau’s analysis. The people of the United States will judge them not by their rhetoric, not by their declarations, proclamations and statements of intent, but by whether their policies result in a people who are better off, have more work and are better paid.\n\nThe leaders of our government cannot attempt to talk their way out of the problem like their predecessors did. They must fix the problem. Now. If they fail to do so, then the election, for all its hoopla, will prove to have been nothing more than a case of putting old, rancid wine in new bottles.\n\nTheirs is not an easy task. We have all become used to the false comfort of having government coddle us, whether we are rich businesses receiving subsidies or poor citizens sustained by government largesse. The election tapped into a foreboding sense that the cost of that comfort now exceeds its benefits, as manifest in looming megadeficits, deep if not unfathomable unfunded liabilities, egregious abuse of fiscal powers symbolized by earmarks and other methods used by politicians to grease the skids of their reelection.\n\nTapping into that foreboding in the recent election was the easy part. Talk of reform is cheap. Enacting reform will be painful.\n\nA reader of Shakespeare will recall the dialogue between Glendower and Hotspur in Henry IV. Glendower claims, “I can call spirits from the vasty deep.” And Hotspur replies, “Why, so can I, or so can any man; But will they come when you do call for them?”[12]\n\nWe shall see if the new Congress will prove worthy of the power the American people have “loaned” them, and, together with the president, actually draw the spirits of fiscal reform and sanity from the “vasty deep” to at long last implement meaningful fiscal and regulatory policy that incentivizes private-sector job creation here at home while arresting the hemorrhaging of our Treasury. If they do, then more Americans will find work and be better off, better paid and freer to make their own decisions about the economy.\n\nIf they don’t, then woe to our children, their children and the American Dream.\n\nI am tempted to end this cheery talk by saying, “Have a nice day!” and walking off the stage. However, I would hate to leave this podium with your having concluded that I am just another central bank curmudgeon. I am professionally programmed to worry. But I am also a red-blooded American, as are all my colleagues at the Fed. I draw on the wisdom of Marcus Nadler, one of the great minds of the Federal Reserve from a period when our economy endured an even more dire test. To counter the intellectual paralysis and down-in-the-mouth pessimism that gripped the financial industry after the Great Depression, Nadler put forth four simple propositions:\n\nFirst, he said: “You’re right if you bet that the United States economy will continue to expand.”\nSecond: “You’re wrong if you bet that it is going to stand still or collapse.”\nThird: “You’re wrong if you bet that any one element in our society is going to ruin or wreck the country.”\nAnd fourth: “You’re right if you bet that [leaders] in business, labor and government are sane, reasonably well informed and decent people who can be counted on to find common ground among all their conflicting interests and work out a compromise solution to the big issues that confront them.”\n\nThis became known as Old Doc Nadler’s Remedy, and for my part, it is spot on. Every one of us preoccupied with what ails us should keep it in mind.\n\nIt may seem like the stuff of our wildest dreams to imagine getting ourselves out of our current nightmarish predicament. But I believe we can and we will. We are Americans. I believe deep in my soul that, when put to the test, Americans rise to the occasion no matter how great the challenge. We have done it time and again. We have no choice but to do it once more.\n\nI think I have said enough, if not too much. In the musty, time-honored tradition of central bankers, I am now happy to avoid answering any questions you might have.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "December 2, 2010 Austin, Texas\n\nI am honored to speak to the new members of the Texas Legislature. I am especially grateful to the speaker for inviting me here today.\n\nI am a little surprised you would ask an official of the Federal Reserve to deliver your keynote address. We are not the most fun people to have around. You know the story: After a worrisome physical, the doctor at M.D. Anderson turns to his patient. “The results are not good,” he says. “I suggest you marry a Federal Reserve official and move to Maypearl over there in Ellis County.” “Geez,” the patient says. “Will I live longer if I do?” “No,” the doctor replies, “but it will sure feel that way.” (I thought Rep. Jim Pitts would like that one.)\n\nSpeaker [Joe] Straus, I’ll do my best to set aside my stodgy Federal Reserve mannerisms today and try to make it snappy.\n\nFirst, some background on the Fed, so you’ll understand where I am coming from. At each of your places is a crisp new Federal Reserve note, a dollar bill. (For the record, I paid for these out of my own pocket; I may be the first speaker to come before this august body and pay you to listen!) You will see that this bill has the letter K printed on its face and four 11’s printed near each corner. The Dallas Fed is the 11th Federal Reserve District out of 12 operating across the country. K is the 11th letter in the alphabet. There are two concentric circles around this letter K. The outermost says “Federal Reserve Texas.” The innermost concentric circle says “Bank of Dallas.” I like to chide my colleagues that not all dollar bills are equal. I tell them those with the letter K on them—what I call “Texas dollars”—are worth more than all the rest because they represent the nation’s most dynamic economic machine.\n\nThe 12 Federal Reserve Banks were set up by federal law in 1913. I am president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, which, together with our branches in Houston, San Antonio and El Paso, handles the business of the Fed in this part of the country, ordering and distributing paper money according to the needs of our district, supervising and regulating banks, lending money against good collateral to all banks in our district for their operating needs, whether we supervise them or not, handling payments (for a fee) for the U.S. Treasury, doing economic studies, educating the public on basic financial matters and helping determine the nation’s monetary policy at meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nAt the FOMC table, I represent the perspectives of some 27 million people who reside in the approximately 360,000 square miles of land that stretches from northern Louisiana to southern New Mexico and produces an economic output that is greater than that of Mexico or Australia and, until recently, exceeded that of India.\n\nThe Dallas Fed makes a profit through its lending and other fee-generating activities: We receive no tax appropriations. After paying a small preferred dividend to the member banks of our district, we turn over our annual profit to the U.S. Treasury. Last year, the 12 Federal Reserve banks collectively turned over $47 billion to U.S. taxpayers. You are looking at an odd duck: A member of a team within a government agency that doesn’t swallow taxpayer money but, instead, operates with private sector efficiency and uses its profits to directly pay down the nation’s debt.\n\nAnother thing that makes me an odd duck: I am not accountable to any political authority. Unlike the seven members of the Federal Reserve Board, neither I nor my counterparts who operate the Fed’s business through the 12 Reserve Banks are appointed by the president of the United States or confirmed by the U.S. Senate. I was selected for this job by—and serve at the pleasure of—the nine directors who compose the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank board, all of whom are citizens of the Fed’s Eleventh District. That board, which was chaired by Ray Hunt when I was hired, has been chaired for the past three years by Jim Hackett, the CEO of Anadarko Petroleum, and will, in turn, be chaired starting in January by Herb Kelleher, the founder of Southwest Airlines. The board consists of eight other individuals who presently hail from Dallas, Houston, Plano, Brady, Huntsville, Fort Worth and Alamogordo, N.M. The Dallas Fed is a Main Street operation.\n\nWhen I was sworn into office, I checked all politics and partisanship at the door. I am neither an “R” nor a “D”; I am politically indifferent. When I took this job, Alan Greenspan told me I had only one obligation, which in his words was “to speak to the truth.” I do my best to speak the straight skinny, informed by the work of the staff of the Dallas Fed, the input I receive from the bankers and businesses and citizens of my district, and my own career as a banker, an investor, a trade negotiator and a man smart enough to come to Texas 37 years ago.\n\nSo what is the straight skinny about the Texas economy?\n\nOver the past 20 years, our employment force has grown at an annual rate of about 2 percent and our economic output has expanded 3.4 percent. At your seat, attached to your Texas dollar, is what we call a “spaghetti graph”—it charts the employment growth over the years of the Eleventh District economy, the bulk of which is Texas, relative to other Fed districts. This graph says it all: With each passing year, we have consistently outperformed the rest of the nation in growing economic prosperity.\n\n\n\nOver the past three especially difficult years, the Texas economy has outperformed all other states, except for those tiny ones whose populations would not aggregate to the size of any of our major cities. Texas was last into the recent frightful recession and one of the strongest coming out. In 2008, we were still creating jobs here. In fact, while the U.S. lost 3.1 million jobs, Texas added 45,000 private sector jobs in 2008. But stout as we are, we caught the recessionary flu at the onset of the fall of 2008, with the result that we lost 362,000 jobs in 2009. We recovered quickly and at a faster pace than the rest of the nation. So far this year we have regained 158,000 jobs and grown at an annual pace of 1.9 percent—a little more than twice the national average of 0.8 percent.[1]\n\nAs of October, the Texas unemployment rate stood at 8.1 percent. To be sure, this is much lower than the national average of 9.6 percent. While our recovery has outpaced that of the nation thus far, unemployment remains stubbornly high and too many Texans are out of work. A big part of your job here in Austin as new legislators is to create the incentives for business to invest and create jobs here and drive that rate of unemployment down.[2]\n\nI expect that during the Q&A, you’ll ask me for a forecast for Texas’ economic growth going forward. Let me head that off at the pass. I am wary of precise economic forecasts. Economics is an art form more than a science, despite claims to the contrary. As such, economic prognostications need to be taken with a grain of salt, even when delivered by Federal Reserve officials, for they are seldom accurate and are subject to constant revisions. One of my professors in college used to say that “the only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable.” So let me just say—as a Piscean—that our Texas economy continues to face significant headwinds, including uncertainty that derives from the indecision or sometimes counterproductive decisions of the national government. And we will continue to be handicapped by low levels of construction activity—particularly commercial construction—largely due to reduced state and local government spending and still moderate gains in consumer spending and demand. Despite these conditions, I expect Texas job growth in 2011 to continue to increase, but only if you can preserve the image and reality of Texas’ uniqueness as a place to do business and grow profits. Profit-making enterprises create jobs. We have too many unemployed workers. We need to attract businesses to come here and grow here. To do so, we have to press our comparative advantage relative to other states.\n\nSo what is our comparative advantage?\n\nAs I see it, the key to Texas’ success lies in our ability to change to a rapidly globalized and competitive economic landscape. Texas’ transition from a resource-based economy built on cattle, cotton and oil to a knowledge-based economy built on human capital and innovation is our greatest success. We have made a fine transition “from cow chips to computer chips” and “from boots to suits.” Texas has mastered the art of what the iconic economist, Joseph Schumpeter, called “creative destruction.” We don’t linger long on the old, and we are quick to usher in the new.\n\nIn the 1930 census, for example, agriculture represented 39 percent of all jobs in the state; today, it is less than 1 percent. Despite this decrease, we continue to be one of the top agricultural producing states in the nation. We are currently No. 1 in ranching and No. 2 in terms of crop production.\n\nIn 1970, 15 percent of Texas jobs were in manufacturing. Presently, manufacturing accounts for only 7 percent of our employment, though output in manufacturing has fallen much less, from 18 percent to 15 percent. Both of these sectors saw a decline in job share not due to the demise of industry, but rather because productivity growth has allowed technology to do more of the work. This has allowed labor to shift to other areas of the economy that are in high demand as our population has become wealthier, including health care, education, finance and leisure services.\n\nA key source of Texas’ growth in manufacturing and services has been technology. The most recent Milken Institute study on high-tech centers across the U.S. concludes that Texas has three of the top 25 high-tech centers in the country—Dallas, Houston and Austin.[3]\n\nThe key factors that have contributed to our ability to grow and adapt to the changing landscape are low tax and regulatory burdens, flexible labor markets, open land availability, the success of tort reform, great seaports, airports and transportation and communication infrastructure, and simply put, the fact that people come here to work and better themselves. All these factors have contributed to a low cost of living and have made doing business in Texas much easier.\n\nBusinesses sell to national and international markets and must compete with producers throughout the world. As a result, they seek areas of production where nominal wages are low for a given level of worker productivity. What matters to workers, however, is their real wages—what they can buy for an honest day’s work. A worker can move from the Silicon Valley or Boston to Dallas or Austin (or Fort Worth or Houston or San Antonio or El Paso), and both the company and the worker are better off. The company can pay him, say, 15 percent less, and yet the worker, who spends a significantly smaller amount for the same home he had in Silicon Valley or Boston, is taxed at lower rates, finds the cost of living cheaper and sees his real income increase by a significant amount. This is what I call the “pull factor,” and it has been a key component of the net immigration of workers and job-creating businesses to the state of Texas.\n\nData from the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University show that net domestic immigration to Texas has been positive every year for at least the past 18 years. In just the past five years, net migration from other U.S. states (not including international migration) has totaled about 690,000 individuals—equivalent to about 40 percent of the population of the Austin–Round Rock MSA. Positive net migration from other states is a key indicator that we are, in fact, exceptional. People do vote with their feet. They are moving to Texas from other states and from abroad because we offer them something better than they have at home.\n\nThis has not gone unnoticed. Just this week, a report published by the Brookings Institution in Washington ranked Austin as the No. 1 city in the U.S. and No. 26 in the world in terms of jobs and income growth during the current economic recovery.[4] Their explanation for Austin’s, and Texas’, success—“continued attraction and retention of high-skilled human capital, its diverse set of export-based industries, and its avoidance of the worst U.S. housing market excesses.” This same study ranked Dallas fourth in the U.S. and 39th in the world in terms of the strength of the recovery. San Antonio ranked 11th and 51st, respectively, while Houston ranked 15th and 61st. As to how others held up during the recession itself, Brookings cited San Antonio as the most “recession-proof” city in the United States.\n\nThere is a lot of room for Texas brag when we talk about our economy and our potential. But we also have vulnerabilities that keep Texas from reaching its full potential. In the latest rankings on the competitiveness of states, the Beacon Hill Institute gave mixed results to Texas. The “good news,” according to the institute, is that Texas scores high on overall tax burden, employment in high-tech industries, venture capital, IPOs, low unionization, unrestrictive minimum wages, exports, foreign direct investment and percent of population born abroad who come to work. The bad news: Texas was ranked near the bottom in most human capital measures. Texas is ranked dead last in the percent of the adult population that graduated from high school, 37th in percent of population enrolled in degree-granting institutions, 35th in academic R&D and 41st in science and engineering degrees awarded.[5]\n\nWhen you get a chance, take a look at the membership list for the Association of American Universities (AAU), which is regarded by most scholars as the definition of the cream of the crop of research universities. The AAU consists of 61 U.S. and two Canadian universities. These 61 U.S. schools garner about 58 percent of all federal R&D dollars to colleges and universities; they are home to 82 percent of all elected members of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine—the highest recognition in each of those fields. Since 1901, 35 percent of all Nobel Prizes have gone to individuals affiliated with AAU universities.[6]\n\nCalifornia has nine AAU members. The New York area also has nine. And Texas? We have three: Rice, UT–Austin and Texas A&M.\n\nAnother source that underscores the Achilles heel of Texas’ economy is U.S. News and World Report. According to its ranking system, Massachusetts has 10 ranked in the top 100 universities—what might be referred to as Tier One universities. The New York area has 11 and California has 14. We have only six: Rice, which is ranked 17th, UT–Austin (ranked 45th), SMU (ranked 56th), Texas A&M (ranked 63rd), Baylor (ranked 79th) and TCU (ranked 99th).[7] I admire the Rice Owls, but I am embarrassed by having them as the sole university in the nation’s top 20. You should be, too. We ought to have several.\n\nYou can’t be happy with the fact that we are falling behind in all aspects of education, from kindergarten right up to the university level. Think about it. We know that incomes and net worth are directly correlated to educational attainment. We know that in the Knowledge Age in which we live, the mind is the capital plant of the modern economy. We all admire those who work with their muscles and by the sweat of their brow in pulling prosperity from the soil on our farms and ranches, or from deep beneath the earth in our mighty oil and gas sector. We rightly applaud those who help Texas produce almost 10 percent of the nation’s manufactured goods. But the world of today and tomorrow is driven by digits, not widgets. We will continue to move up the value-added ladder and stay ahead of the competition—not just from other states, but from China and the new emerging powers—only if we are able to nurture and harness Texas brains.\n\nYou have a lot on your plate as new legislators. Don’t lose track of this simple, unalterable, indisputable, critical fact: We have done well so far; our economy is mighty. But to stay ahead of the curve and compete in tomorrow’s global marketplace, Texas must do better in educating its population.\n\nAn obvious challenge for all of you is going to be dealing with the biennial budget at a time when our communities and our nation are fiscally strained. Over the past two years, Texas stood out because it appeared to encounter only modest fiscal imbalance after entering the recession later than most other states. Yet now there is talk that a two-year budget deficit of some $21 billion is looming.\n\nWe will see what [Comptroller] Susan Combs releases in January regarding the official predicted shortfall. Whatever that number is, one thing is certain: Plugging a deficit isn’t going to be painless. Sales tax accounts for about 65 percent of our state’s tax revenue; while its freefall has abated and is reversing, sales tax is unlikely to grow as dramatically over the biennium as we would like. On the other side of the ledger, education accounts for 41 percent of state expenditures. It is not my job to tell you how this issue should be resolved—the Fed creates money, but you and your counterparts in Washington are the folks elected to decide how much of it is collected from the people in the form of taxes and then parsed out. My job is to remind you that if you wish for Texas to remain a beacon of entrepreneurialism and capitalist hope in today’s knowledge-based economy, the current budget dilemma must be resolved. And if you want Austin and all of Texas, in the words of that Brookings Institution report, to continue to “attract and retain high-skilled human capital,” it must not be resolved by cutting off your noses to spite your face by shortchanging education.\n\nThis is not to say that education quality is determined solely by the number of dollars we direct to it. To be sure, there are many nonfiscal aspects of our unexceptional and vulnerable education system that need to be addressed. My plea is that each of you make it one of your principal goals to make Texas an educational powerhouse. High-value-added, job-creating businesses that are world beaters will not move their top executives to Texas unless they can send their children and grandchildren to top schools and universities.\n\nWhatever our ethnicity or origin, Texans are a race of risk takers. We have from the very start defied conventional wisdom. We must now take risks, defy conventional wisdom and turn around our education system. Our economic future depends upon it.\n\nIf you’re looking for motivation to do what most others consider unthinkable, dust off T.R. Fehrenbach’s history of Texas, titled Lone Star. It’s a long book—some 719 pages. But it is most readable and is, to my mind, perhaps the finest history of Texas ever written, though it has now been over 40 years since it was first printed.\n\nFor example, Fehrenbach walks his readers through how Mirabeau B. Lamar moved the capital to Austin in 1840.[8] Then, only 900 people lived here on the border of Comanche country, facing a wild, frightful, untamed western frontier. Yet here we are today, as I mentioned, with one of the most elite think tanks in the country concluding that Austin is the highest ranked of all American cities in this recovery and ranked internationally, incidentally, just below Säo Paulo and above Montreal. Little old Austin, ranked right up there with two of the best-known cities in the world. Who would have thought that possible?\n\nWho would have dared think that in the blink of history’s eye, Texas would be outproducing Mexico or Australia and give the more than 1 billion people of India a run for their money? Fehrenbach recites how great men and establishment figures of the time like John Quincy Adams scoffed at Houston and Lamar and at Texas. Too bad they aren’t around now to see what those early Texas legislators and their successors—your predecessors—set in train.\n\nWhat has been accomplished here could only have been made possible by a Texas government that understands that it pays to respect the “animal spirits” that drive entrepreneurialism and risk taking that pushes the economic frontier both literally and figuratively. A legislature that dreams big. How else can you explain the chutzpah of the Texas Congress that once passed a resolution declaring the Californias as Texas soil? Or the gall to negotiate diplomatic recognition or commercial treaties with Britain and France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Or commission its own sovereign Navy and become so vexing a force that Texas’ annexation became the cutting edge issue that helped determine the election of the dark-horse candidate, James Polk, as president of the United States, with whom your predecessors then negotiated the only deal with the United States allowing a state joining the union to retain title to all of its unoccupied land rather than surrender it to Washington?\n\nAs Fehrenbach puts it: “The Texan ethic and Texas society rewarded enterprise,”[9] … “work was the real virtue.”[10] “We chose this land; we took it; we made it bear fruit.”[11] We are a people for whom “the cult of courage was obvious.”[12] And it is still obvious, whether you live in Brady or Huntsville or the toniest neighborhoods of Highland Park, Alamo Heights or River Oaks. Or even Maypearl.\n\nFehrenbach distills the Texas spirit into one simple sentence: “Men who exist get overrun by men who act.”[13]\n\nNow, if you were from part of the United States where the past is more glorious than the future and you were listening to what I have said today, you would at this point of this speech likely be thinking this all sounds like something that rhymes with “bull wit.” But we who live here know this place and its spirit.\n\nMy wife, Nancy, and I so love this place that we named our youngest child Texana. She was a pistol—blond and tall and beautiful. She was a published poet, an accomplished artist, and a brilliant student at Wellesley College and at Harvard. She spoke fluent German, Italian, Russian and Spanish. Yet she was a Texas woman: She could outfish and outride any man and was happiest when she was in the wide-open outdoors of our ranch in East Texas. She was taken from us in April. She was 24.\n\nI make this plea of you today in Texana’s memory: You and your colleagues in the Texas legislature are the trustees of the future of her generation and all that come after her. You hold the future of this unique franchise we call Texas in your hands. Your job is to keep Texas exceptional—to create the conditions that safeguard and nourish our prosperity and that of our children and our children’s children. You’ve got some tough decisions to make. Be courageous. You are not here “to exist.” You are here to act.",

            "content": "November 8, 2010 San Antonio, Texas\n\nIt hasn’t escaped me that you asked me to speak today in the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center. Politely stated, Congressman Gonzalez was “wary” of the Federal Reserve. Today, in his memory, I will operate under the presumption that the good congressman, bless his soul, is holding a congressional hearing somewhere in the hereafter and has, as he did here on earth, called upon members of the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC) to account for themselves after the Fed’s recent actions.\n\nAs is our tradition, I can only account for and speak for myself and the Dallas Fed, not for anybody else or any other Bank or for the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors. Today, I will provide a précis of the analysis of the nation’s economic predicament I presented to the FOMC last week on behalf of the Dallas Fed, summarize the arguments I made with regard to the course of monetary policy, and then provide a personal perspective on the decision made by the committee as a whole. Afterward, I will do my best to answer any questions you may have.\n\nAt all FOMC meetings, after the staff has briefed the committee on projections of the models and provided their own insights, Chairman [Ben] Bernanke calls upon all of the participants in the FOMC discussion to present to the others at the table their individual sense of the economy. When I am called upon, I endeavor to give a perspective derived from the work of the Dallas Fed staff, complemented by the responses to a survey I do personally of a wide swath of CEOs and CFOs of businesses, large and small, across the country as well as financial market operators I know from my former days as a fund manager. There are plenty of sophisticated forecasting models available to all of us at the Fed. To me, the key to crafting monetary policy is placing the theoretical analysis—done by our able staffs of economists using quantitative modeling—within the qualitative context of economic behavior as practiced by businesses, consumers, investors and other players actually operating in the field.\n\nThe essence of what I reported to my colleagues when we met last week is that more things are moving in the right direction than in the wrong direction. There are some green shoots beginning to emerge in a landscape still pocked-marked by brown spots. General economic conditions are improving slightly and are expected to continue doing so. The risk of a double dip in economic activity has lessened, as has the risk of deflation. Financial speculation and excess, however, is beginning to raise its hoary head.\n\nOn the real economy front, data from the manufacturers, railroads, shippers, express shippers, retailers, service-sector operators and others I survey indicate that activity picked up on a year-over-year basis in October and was slightly better than the year-over-year pace of September.\n\nAs might be expected, my contacts report price pressures for a range of commodities, including corn, higher-grade food oils, cotton, pulp and, of course, metals and gold used in manufacturing, including specialized products such as semiconductors. This is nothing you wouldn’t already know from a daily reading of the financial press. I do find it of interest that one of my CEO contacts just came back from meeting with all 450 of his Chinese suppliers and reports that the Chinese government was “encouraging” those manufacturers to grant wage increases to their workers on the order of 15 to 20 percent, in large part to goose up domestic spending. Combining wage imperatives with recent commodity price increases, the manufacturers of low-tech Chinese products, from wicker to clothing to the lower end of entertainment devices, have started their bids for supplying the fall of 2011 needs of this particular large importer at dollar price levels 30 percent higher than current levels. Alternative production sites like Vietnam and India, according to this source, are only slightly underbidding these Chinese suppliers.\n\nTo be sure, these are opening positions for negotiation. But they are alarming. They might portend a shift back to sourcing low-value-added goods in lower-cost venues like Mexico over time, but in the immediate future, this hints at a squeeze on margins for those sourcing from China, Vietnam and India. Other CEOs who source inputs in the Far East report the same phenomenon, which is vexing because none of them feel they have the pricing wherewithal to pass on cost increases of more than 2 percent or so in light of the weakness of consumption. The one thing they are certain of, however, is that retail goods inflation is highly unlikely to drift downward.\n\nThis is in keeping with what we see by examining the entrails of the Trimmed Mean PCE calculation of inflation that is done uniquely by the Dallas Fed of the broad basket of items that make up the nation’s personal consumption expenditures, or PCE.[1] The Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate tells a slightly different story from that told by the core PCE analysis, which gets so much attention from most analysts and the FOMC. To be sure, the trimmed mean came in at a 1 percent annualized rate in September, compared with an annualized 1.3 percent rate in August. The numbers for those two months, however, are both above the rates we saw earlier in 2010, and the 12-month trimmed mean rate has been steady over the past six months, within 0.1 percentage points of 1 percent (and clocking in at precisely 1 percent for the past three months).\n\nIf the trimmed mean is a better gauge of the underlying trend in PCE inflation (and we at the Dallas Fed think it is), then it’s not too surprising that the core PCE rate should be moving down toward the lower and steadier trimmed mean rate. That does not mean we are drifting toward deflation. The message the trimmed mean is sending is consistent with the price picture I have drawn for my colleagues in the past couple of meetings: The underlying trend in inflation appears, for the time being, to be holding steady, albeit at the rate we were accustomed to in the 1950s rather than the rate we have become accustomed to since then.\n\nWithout pricing power, and in the face of anemic demand, all of my nonfinancial business contacts—large or small, public or private—continue working to protect their margins through productivity enhancement. And to take advantage of ready access to cheap money to finance productivity enhancement, as well as to refinance their balance sheets, pay dividends or buy in their stock (if they are public). Some of the larger ones report borrowing domestically in size and warehousing those funds so as to avoid having to repatriate the funds building up abroad at onerous tax rates. A few—and this is good news—are using cheap money to refinance their remaining pension obligations in light of unsustainable discount factors used for accounting purposes.\n\nTo dwell on a point: Most all the businesses I talk to are expanding investment in productivity enhancement. Far too few of the large companies I talk to report interest in hiring American workers or committing to large-scale CAPEX (capital expenditures) in the United States; they believe their potential for return on investment (ROI) is greater elsewhere. The smaller companies that do not have global options are putting off hiring until the coast is clear on the tax and regulatory fronts. This reticence intensified during the final innings of the election season, which begs the question of whether this will now change with the new Congress. I’ll circle back to this issue in my concluding remarks.\n\nNonfinancial and financial companies alike report that they are flush with liquidity. Bankers are aggressively courting the larger corporate credits; several of my CEO and CFO interlocutors report that in the last few weeks, the biggest banks have approached them “literally begging to lend us 10-year money at less than 3 percent.” As you well know, corporate debt markets, including junk markets, are robust. And smaller companies are not complaining about the lack of access to capital. As a special part of our last monthly Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey, conducted during October, I had our staff ask questions of the 240 companies surveyed about credit availability. Only 60 percent responded that they were seeking credit for financing long-term expenditures, and of that 60 percent, only 18 percent responded that they were having “substantial” or “extreme” difficulty obtaining that financing. Only 54 percent of those 240 Texas companies reported that they were seeking short-term credit, and of that 54 percent, only 12 percent responded that they were having “substantial” or “extreme” difficulty getting credit. To be sure, this survey was specific to my district, the Eleventh Federal Reserve District. But given that the Dallas Fed’s Business Activity Index has the highest correlation of all Federal Reserve Bank surveys to sentiment reflected in the national Purchasing Managers Index, or PMI, our survey might have some credence.\n\nIt concerns me that liquidity is omnipresent on bank and corporate balance sheets, and yet it is not being used to hire American workers.\n\nIt also concerns me that the most recent Lipper/AMG financial market data show year-to-date flows into virtually all asset classes except money market funds. The flows are strong into every category: high-risk to low-risk bond vehicles, taxable and nontaxable, domestic and external, fixed and floating rate, and, of course, commodities. Margin debt remains shy of 2007 highs but is fast approaching levels that prevailed before the NASDAQ implosion in 2001; in fact, margin-account debit balances as a percentage of the market capitalization of the S&P 500 now exceed the precrash level of 1987 and 2001.\n\nJunk yields are at their lowest levels since October 2007. And the leveraged buyout market is back to paying 2006 levels of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of 6 to 8.5 times, with the recent announcement of Carlyle Group’s reported 11 times EBITDA purchase of Syniverse Holdings echoing the peak of the precrash craze. As you know, buyout people do not typically acquire companies with a plan to expand the workforce, but instead with an eye to tighten operations, drive productivity, rejigger balance sheets and provide an attractive payback, usually in shorter time than under normal corporate horizons. And the corporations I talk to that are eyeing possible acquisitions with their surplus cash and ready access to the credit markets are not given to thinking of strategic acquisitions as a way to expand payrolls.\n\nIn sum, scanning the business landscape and the conditions of the financial markets, I concluded as a golfer that the greens are playing very fast and must be approached with great caution. At a minimum, I concluded, the committee would need to be very careful in how we calibrated our next strokes, lest we overplay it.\n\nI fully understand the theoretical impulse to drive long-term interest rates to lower levels in hopes of stimulating loan demand and challenging the propensity for economic actors to hoard rather than invest. Given that foreign exchange markets react to interest rate differentials between countries, one effect of engineering lower rates would be to devalue the dollar, presumably to create demand for exports. The ultimate objective would be to advance final demand, generate employment for American workers and revive output.\n\nI agree that we are indeed in what is referred to in economic parlance as a liquidity trap. Yet, I think it worth noting that we already have low interest rates, and spreads against risk-free instruments are historically narrow. Despite their theoretical promise, reductions in interest rates to Lilliputian levels have not done much thus far to spark loan demand. Loans are desirable when business see an opportunity for tapping credit markets to earn a return on investment that significantly outpaces the cost of credit and other risk factors. Even with the low rates that already prevail, businesses lack confidence that they will earn a superior ROI by investing so as to expand their domestic workforce, in comparison to what they might earn from alternative investments abroad or by buying in their stock or cleaning up their balance sheets. For their part, consumers will borrow when they believe it makes sense to shift consumption forward. But after the sobering experience of the past three years, they are restrained by a lack of confidence that their future income streams will be sufficient to cover their payment obligations.\n\nOn the supply side, we know that businesses are floating on a sea of liquidity. Banks already hold over $1 trillion in excess reserves; holdings of government securities as a percentage of total assets on bank balance sheets are growing; loans as a percentage of assets are declining.\n\nIf we had a level of bank reserves or liquidity in the marketplace that was binding or inhibiting loan growth, I could understand the impulse to relieve that stricture. Further quantitative easing through additional asset purchases will surely increase the level of bank reserves, lower rates marginally and add more liquidity to markets while weakening the dollar. The more germane question is whether this works to the benefit of job creation and wards off financial excess.\n\nIn his speech in Jackson Hole, Wyo., in August, Chairman Bernanke had asked all of us to consider the costs and the benefits of further accommodation. My response was that I was skeptical about many of the presumed benefits of further asset purchases. I was more certain of some of the potential costs.\n\nOne cost is the risk of being perceived as embarking on the slippery slope of debt monetization. We know that once a central bank is perceived as targeting government debt yields at a time of persistent budget deficits, concern about debt monetization quickly arises.\n\nI realized that two other central banks were engaging in quantitative easing—the Bank of Japan and, most notably, our friends at the Bank of England. But the Bank of England is offsetting an announced fiscal policy tightening that out-Thatchers Thatcher. This is not the case here. Here we suffer from fiscal incontinence and regulatory misfeasance. If this were to change, I might advocate for accommodation. But that is not yet happening. And I worry that by providing monetary accommodation, we are reducing the odds that fiscal discipline will be brought to bear. More on that in a moment.\n\nI also worry about the risk of our being perceived as using quantitative easing and buying copious amounts of financial assets above and beyond the ordinary bounds of the Federal Reserve’s System Open Market Account as “the new normal” for implementing monetary policy. Everything we know from monetary history tells us that in times of crisis, we should open the floodgates—this has been the practice of central bankers since the 19th century. This is what monetary theorists might call Bagehot 101, after the British patron saint of central banking, Walter Bagehot. We did it in 2008 and it worked to pull us from the maw of financial panic and economic ruin. But it did not seem to me last week to be a time of panic or crisis. I suggested that were we to act by throwing more money at the economy under these more benign circumstances, the markets might come to expect more, that quantitative easing could become like kudzu for market operators—expectations of continued Federal Reserve purchases of Treasury securities as normal operating procedure might grow and grow and be terribly difficult to trim once they take root in the minds of market operators.\n\nI might understand the case for accommodation if serious deflation were a clear and present danger. As I pointed out by citing the trimmed mean and through my anecdotal reports, it is not. I would add for this audience here today that this is thanks to Ben Bernanke’s adroit leadership in engineering the liquidity measures implemented during the Panic of 2008-09 and by avoiding the policy errors of the 1930s. Because of what we did in staring down panic and its aftermath, neither M2 money growth nor inflation has fallen off the cliff.[2] And while nominal growth is less than desired and is very painful, nominal income is growing, however incrementally, not shrinking.\n\nI expressed concern about the purported benefits of a weaker dollar in the exchange markets. Much of what we export is in the form of high-value-added goods and services and in commodities like cotton and soybeans that we produce with enormous efficiency. A not insignificant portion of what we import, in addition to oil that feeds into gasoline prices, is used to clothe and support lower-income earners, the very people suffering from unemployment or job insecurity whom we are endeavoring to help. When faced with a further squeeze on their margins that comes with higher import prices, the Wal-Marts, Dollar Generals, Costcos and other stores where the most impacted people buy necessities will likely react by driving productivity even harder, which, translated, means selling more while employing fewer workers.\n\nI also suggested that if the consequence of further easing was to weaken the dollar, this might undermine our standing in international fora, and drawing on my experience as a former Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, might undermine efforts to ward off protectionism.\n\nAs to the proposition that higher prices of financial assets will liberate those most in need, I wondered aloud if that were indeed true. We are already seeing the beginnings of speculative activity in stocks, bonds, buyouts and commodity markets. The rich and the quick are certainly able to exploit these circumstances to get richer. I have no problem with market operators making money; I did so myself in my previous life as a funds manager (before I took the vow of financial chastity and joined the Fed!). But I take no comfort, and see considerable risk, in conducting monetary policy that has the consequence of transferring income from the poor and the worker and the saver to the rich. Senior citizens and others who saved and played by the rules are earning nothing on their savings, while big debtors and too-big-to-fail oligopoly banks benefit from their subsidy. I know of no presidential administration or Congress, Republican or Democrat, that will tolerate, let alone advocate for, that dynamic for long, and I expressed my worry that this could come back to bite us and possibly threaten our independence.\n\nThen there is the issue of exit policy. The more we engage in a policy of asset purchases that moves us further out the yield curve—and the more we laden our balance sheet with price-sensitive assets—the greater the likelihood of realizing a loss on our holdings. One can model out some of this risk and conclude that the coupon stream of the securities we will be holding will protect us against capital loss under reasonable price-reversal scenarios. But if unreasonable scenarios prevail, I shudder at the prospect of the Chairman or any other members of the FOMC appearing before the House Banking Committee in 2012 to report that the central bank of the United States has generated a loss of X billion dollars.\n\nIn sum, I asked that the FOMC consider that we might be prescribing the wrong medicine for the ailment from which our economy is suffering. Liquidity and abundant money are not the binding constraints on the economic activity we wish to see. The binding constraints are uncertainty about income and future aggregate demand, the disincentives fiscal and regulatory policy impose on ridding decisionmakers of that uncertainty, and the reluctance, given those disincentives, of those who have the power to create jobs for our people to invest in undertakings that would create them.\n\nThe remedy for what ails the economy is, in my view, in the hands of the fiscal and regulatory authorities, not the Fed. I could not state with conviction that purchasing another several hundred billion dollars of Treasuries—on top of the amount we were already committed to buy in order to compensate for the run-off in our $1.25 trillion portfolio of mortgage-backed securities—would lead to job creation and final-demand-spurring behavior. But I could envision such action would lead to a declining dollar, encourage further speculation, provoke commodity hoarding, accelerate the transfer of wealth from the deliberate saver and the unfortunate, and possibly place at risk the stature and independence of the Fed.\n\nMy perspective, as with those of all other members of the FOMC, was given a thoughtful and fair hearing at the table. After deliberation, the majority of the committee concluded that under current and foreseeable conditions, the better approach was to purchase $600 billion in Treasuries between now and the end of the second quarter of next year, on top of the amount projected to replace the paydown in mortgage backed-securities. The math of this new exercise is readily transparent: The Federal Reserve will buy $110 billion a month in Treasuries, an amount that, annualized, represents the projected deficit of the federal government for next year. For the next eight months, the nation’s central bank will be monetizing the federal debt.\n\nThis is risky business. We know that history is littered with the economic carcasses of nations that incorporated this as a regular central bank practice. So how can the decision made last Wednesday be justified?\n\nChairman Bernanke provided a public answer in an editorial in the Washington Post the day after the meeting. In that editorial, he summarized the analysis of the majority of the committee:\n\n“This approach eased financial conditions in the past and, so far, looks to be effective again. … Easier financial conditions will promote economic growth … lower mortgage rates will make housing more affordable and allow home owners to refinance. Lower corporate bond rates will encourage investment. And higher stock prices will boost consumer wealth and help increase confidence, which can also spur spending.”\n\nFor good measure, he added, “We have made all necessary preparations, and we are confident that we have the tools to unwind these policies at the appropriate time.” And over this weekend, he added in a public speech that he did not think the new levels of asset purchases would unleash “super ordinary” inflation.\n\nHaving made my arguments to the contrary, I am a member of the committee that Chairman Bernanke leads. I respect the will of the committee and defer to the Chairman as its spokesperson.\n\nI would suggest that even if you share my cautious perspective on this matter, you might be assuaged by looking at this new initiative as a bridge loan to fiscal sanity. We have a new Congress. From my perspective, there are two ways your central bank can approach them: the way it is being done by the Bank of England, which appears to me to be seeking to cushion the adjustment to a policy of fiscal abstinence by a new government after a prolonged period of fiscal debauchery; or to provide the space necessary for our newly elected Congress to work with the president to find a way to restore fiscal sobriety without choking off economic recovery.\n\nThe new leadership of the House of Representatives, and the reelected leadership of the reshaped Senate, together with President Obama, surely must understand that we are at the end of the line and that time is of the essence. The Fed is doing its level best to deliver on the dual mandate it was given by the Congress. But monetary accommodation, by itself, is not the answer to our current woes. The Fed, as I see it, has taken a leap of faith that our political leaders will forge a sensible budgetary and regulatory path that incentivizes businesses to put to work the money the Fed is printing to invest in creating jobs for American workers while averting what the Stanford historian David Kennedy described in yesterday’s New York Times as “a looming fiscal apocalypse.” We need for the Congress to move quickly, beginning in its lame-duck session. As Winston Churchill said, “We need action this day!”\n\nOtherwise, the effect of quantitative easing will, in my view, simply result in financial speculation, further investment in more welcoming quarters abroad and, ultimately, in “super ordinary” inflation. The FOMC is taking a calculated risk. If the Congress and the Executive fail to deliver, I believe the FOMC will have to consider changing course.\n\nHere is the message: The Fed is going out of its way to be a good citizen. It is time for the Congress to do the same.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "October 19, 2010 New York, N.Y.\n\nThank you, Steve (Gallagher). I am incredibly touched that you and the New York Association for Business Economics are holding this lunchtime rally for the Texas Rangers baseball franchise.\n\nI have been asked to talk about the economy. I realize that many of you are here looking for clues as to what will emerge from the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). You might get a sense of what shapes one FOMC participant’s perspectives and inputs this afternoon. But let me say right up front that as in the American League championship playoffs, the outcome of the next FOMC is yet to be determined.\n\nJust as bookies in Vegas adjust their lines for the playoffs, the oddsmakers on the Street are constantly reassessing their positions regarding monetary policy. They change with new developments in the economy (the Fed’s Beige Book, for example, will be released tomorrow); with every public pronouncement of individual FOMC members; with insights proffered by the daily wire services and editorials in the Sunday editions of the nation’s finest newspapers (and good regional ones like your New York Times); and with the insights of consultants and analysts, some of whom even claim, spuriously, to have access to the internal deliberations of Federal Reserve policymakers. But until the committee meets, nothing is decided.\n\nYou should bear this in mind given the recent speculation about the prospect for further quantitative easing or the shape and nature of forward policy guidance: No decisions have been made on these fronts and will not be made until the committee concludes its deliberations at its next meeting on Nov. 3.\n\nWell, there is your “take home” from lunch! But given that we have some time left, if you will indulge me, I would like to give you one man’s view on the outlook for the U.S. economy. I do so with considerable humility being in a room full of major league economists. And because the professional economists among you know as well as I do that John Kenneth Galbraith was not all that far off when he divulged that “economic forecasting was invented to make astrology look respectable.”\n\nSo what do I divine from contemplating the celestial bodies of the economy? And how might this shape my approach to monetary policy?\n\nLate last year and in early 2010, we had a burst of growth led primarily by inventory adjustment. Real inventory accumulation rose from a minus $162 billion in the second quarter of 2009 to a plus $69 billion in the second quarter of 2010, a swing of $231 billion that accounted for approximately 61 percent of the 3 percent real GDP growth that we saw over that four-quarter period. With inventories now better aligned with sales, it is doubtful this variable will provide much economic propulsion in the coming quarters.\n\nTurning to final demand, the weak pace of recovery in U.S. export markets and political and budget realities mean that little near-term growth impetus can be expected from net exports and government purchases. Only consumption and nonresidential fixed investment are likely to make positive contributions to the expansion. In these sectors, there is no reason to believe that growth will be notably strong, though the latest retail numbers surprised to the upside despite the warm weather, which typically retards fall sales. Residential investment, meanwhile, was an outright drag on growth last quarter, reflecting the hangover from expiring tax incentives; now, the foreclosure debacle has added a serious wrinkle to the potential for a clearing of that crucial market. On net, then, I see only modest third-quarter growth at a level slightly above 2 percent, with a gradual rate of acceleration to what would best be described as moderate growth after that.\n\nContemplating this scenario, the brow begins to furrow. We are barely cruising above what we at the Dallas Fed call “stall speed.” Annual real gross domestic product (GDP) growth below 2 percent has predicated every recession since 1970. If we continue to barely clear the 2 percent hurdle, the pace of economic recovery will be insufficient to create the number of jobs the United States needs to bring down unemployment significantly in the foreseeable future. If we cannot generate enough new jobs to sufficiently absorb the labor force over the intermediate future, we cannot expect to grow the final demand needed to achieve more rapid economic growth.\n\nIn the summation of the recent FOMC meeting, released after we concluded our deliberations, it was crisply noted that “employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls.” At the same time, the committee reported it saw no prospect on the foreseeable horizon for inflation—the bête noire of all central bankers—to raise its ugly head; neither was the bête rouge of deflation highlighted. Instead, in more convoluted syntax, the majority view of the committee was summarized as follows: “Measures of underlying inflation are currently at levels somewhat below those the committee judges most consistent, over the longer run, with its mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.” The statement concluded by saying that the FOMC is “prepared to provide additional accommodation if needed to support the economic recovery and to return inflation, over time, to levels consistent with its mandate.”[1] Chairman (Ben) Bernanke, who I might add is the only person empowered to speak on behalf of the entire committee, repeated this verbatim in the penultimate sentence of his speech last Friday in Boston: “In particular,” he said, “the FOMC is prepared to provide additional accommodation ifneeded to support the economic recovery and to return inflation over time to levels consistent with our mandate.” And he concluded by saying: “Of course, in considering possible further actions, the FOMC will take account of the potential costs and risks of nonconventional policies, and, as always, the committee’s actions are contingent on incoming information about the economic outlook and financial conditions.”[2] In short, the Chairman said nothing in Boston that hadn't already been said in the FOMC's most recent pronouncement or in his earlier speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\n\nLet me give you my two cents on some of the potential costs and risks that the Chairman has been referencing in his recent speeches.\n\nI very much share the concerns of my colleagues who fret that unemployment is not receding quickly enough. (I spent too much of my childhood with a father who, bless his soul, often struggled to find work.) Given that we at the Fed are mandated to maintain price stability and create the monetary conditions to encourage maximum employment growth—at a time when inflation is “somewhat below” what the committee as a whole judges appropriate—I instinctively understand the impulse to put the monetary pedal to the metal to try to move the needle on employment growth. The problem is that, presently, the efficacy of further accommodation using nonconventional policies is not all that clear.\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve buys Treasuries to drive down yields, it adds money to the financial system. In sharp contrast to the depths of the Panic of 2008, when liquidity had evaporated and we stepped into the breach to revive it, today there is abundant liquidity in our economy. The excess reserves of private banks parked at the 12 Federal Reserve Banks exceed $1 trillion. Nonfinancial corporations have an aggregate liquid-asset ratio running at a seven-year high; cash flow from current production is running above total investment expenditure; cash as a percentage of market cap is extraordinarily high. Credit availability remains a challenge for small businesses, but only 3 percent of small businesses surveyed by the National Federation of Independent Business reported financing as their top business problem in October.[3] And reports of lagging receivables or the stretching out of payment terms that were so prominent only one year ago in the corporate supply chain have become as scarce as hens’ teeth.\n\nHowever one may view the prominence of credit constraints for small businesses, it is unclear whether broad monetary actions will alleviate them; it might be more appropriate, perhaps, for the Treasury to undertake a targeted fiscal initiative to improve credit availability to small businesses. For mid- and large-size nonfinancial firms, capital is fairly abundant in America, and it is unclear how much they would benefit from lowering Treasury interest rates.\n\nThe vexing question is: Why isn’t this liquidity being utilized to hire new workers and reduce unemployment? Why is it that, as pointed out in Alan Greenspan’s op-ed in the Oct. 7 edition of the Financial Times, the share of liquid cash flow allocated to long-term fixed asset investment has fallen to its lowest level in the 58 years for which data are available?[4] If current dramatically high levels of liquidity and low interest rates are not being harnessed to add to payrolls or expand capital expenditures, would driving interest rates further down and adding more liquidity to the system through Fed purchases of Treasury securities induce U.S. businesses and consumers to get on with spending it?\n\nThe intrepid theoretical economist would argue in the affirmative, the logic being that there is a tipping point at which the market becomes convinced that money held in reserve earning negligible returns is at risk of being debased through some inflation and, thus, should be spent rather than hoarded. Hence, the appeal of the Fed’s showing a little leg of inflationary permissiveness.\n\nThere is some valid theory behind this approach. Yet, my soundings among those who actually do the work of creating sustainable jobs and making productive capital investments—private businesses, big and small—indicate that few are willing to commit to expanding U.S. payrolls or to undertaking significant commitments to expand capital expenditures in the U.S. other than in areas that enhance the productivity of the current workforce. Without exception, all the business leaders I interview cite nonmonetary issues—fiscal policy and regulatory constraints or, worse, uncertainty going forward—and better opportunities for earning a return on investment elsewhere as factors inhibiting their willingness to commit to expansion in the U.S. As the CEO of one medium-size business put it to me shortly before the last FOMC, “Part of it is uncertainty: We just don’t know what the new regulations [sic] like health care are going to cost and what the new rules will be. Part of it is certainty: We know that taxes are eventually going to have to increase to get us out of the fiscal hole Republicans and Democrats alike have dug for us, and we know that regulatory intervention will be getting more intense.” Small wonder that most business leaders I survey, including those at small businesses, remain fixated on driving productivity and lowering costs, budgeting to “get fewer people to wear more hats.” Tax and regulatory uncertainty—combined with a now well-inculcated culture of driving all resources, including labor, to their most productive use at least cost—does not bode well for a rapid diminution of unemployment and the concomitant expansion of demand.\n\nSo, it is indeed true that some economic theories would lead one to believe we can shake job creation from the trees if we were to further expand our balance sheet, and/or induce greater final demand if people and businesses with money in their pockets believe the central bank will tolerate inflation somewhat “above” levels consistent with our mandate. Yet, to paraphrase the early 20th century progressive Clarence Day—the once-ubiquitous contributor to my favorite magazine, The New Yorker—“Too many (theorists) begin with a dislike of reality.”[5] The reality of fiscal and regulatory policy inhibiting the transmission mechanism of monetary policy is most definitely present and is vexing to monetary policy makers. It is indisputably a significant factor holding back the economic recovery.\n\nOne of my most intellectually credentialed and also pragmatic colleagues, the president of the Minneapolis Fed, Narayana Kocherlakota, has noted that a deep-seated problem is structural unemployment. He believes that we do not have a workforce adequate to meet the needs of the high-value-added businesses that define the U.S. “Firms have jobs but can’t find appropriate workers,” he says. And he concludes, “It is hard to see how the Fed can do much to cure this problem.”[6] I would add that if this were true, then the matching of job skills to needs is doubly complicated if businesses feel handicapped by the current tax and regulatory regime or see other countries as better places to expand in a globalized, cyber-ized economy that encourages investment to gravitate to optimal locations for enhancing return on investment.\n\nWhile its sports coverage is second to none, my favorite part of the New York Times is the obituary section. I read it daily not only because it is superbly written, but because it offers nuggets of wisdom learned by others who have gone before us. If you had read the obit of former Fed Governor Sherman Maisel two weeks ago, you might have noticed a relevant quote from his repertoire: “In my view, changes in monetary policy may be desirable, but they should be used only to a limited degree in attempts to control movements in demand arising from non-monetary sources.”[7] There are limits to what monetary policy can accomplish if fiscal policy blocks the road.\n\nOf course, if fiscal and regulatory authorities are able to dispel the angst that businesses are reporting and put together a credible plan for deficit reduction that does not choke off growth, further accommodation might not even be needed. If job-creating businesses are more certain about future policy and are satisfactorily incentivized, they are more likely to take advantage of low interest rates, release the liquidity they are hoarding and invest it robustly in hiring and training a workforce that will propel the American economy to new levels of prosperity. This would render moot the argument for QE2, or a second round of quantitative easing. The key is to remove or reduce the tax and regulatory uncertainties that act as an impediment to businesses as they respond to increases in final demand. I think most all would consider this to be a far more desirable outcome than being saddled with a bloated Fed balance sheet.\n\nIn my darkest moments, I have begun to wonder if the monetary accommodation we have already engineered might even be working in the wrong places. The Treasury International Capital, or TIC, data released yesterday morning show that foreign interest in buying Treasuries remains robust. Yet, far too many of the large corporations I survey that are committing to fixed investment report that the most effective way to deploy cheap money raised in the current bond markets or in the form of loans from banks, beyond buying in stock or expanding dividends, is to invest it abroad where taxes are lower and governments are more eager to please. This would not be of concern if foreign direct investment in the U.S. were offsetting this impulse. This year, however, net direct investment in the U.S. has been running at a pace that would exceed minus $200 billion, meaning outflows of foreign direct investment are exceeding inflows by a healthy margin. We will have to watch the data as they unfold to see if this is momentary fillip or evidence of a broader trend. But I wonder: If others cotton to the view that the Fed is eager to “Open (the) Spigot,” as proclaimed on the front page of the Oct. 6 Wall Street Journal,[8] might this not add to the uncertainty already created by the fiscal incontinence of Congress and the regulatory and rulemaking excesses about which businesses now complain?\n\nIn performing a cost/benefit analysis of a possible QE2, we will need to bear in mind that one cost already incurred in the process of running an easy-money policy has been to drive down the returns earned by savers, especially those who do not have the means or sophistication or the demographic profile to place their money at risk further out in the yield curve or who are wary of the inherent risk of stocks. A great many baby boomers or older cohorts who played by the rules, saved their money and migrated over time, as prudent investment counselors advise, to short- to intermediate-dated, fixed-income instruments are earning extremely low nominal and real returns on their savings. Further reductions in rates earned on savings will hardly endear the Fed to this portion of the population. Moreover, driving down bond yields might force increased pension contributions from corporations and state and local governments, decreasing the deployment of monies toward job maintenance in the public sector. Debasing those savings with even a little more inflation than what is above minimal levels acceptable to the FOMC is also unlikely to endear the Fed to these citizens. And if—and here I especially stress the word “if” because the evidence is thus far only anecdotal and has yet to be confirmed by longer-term data—if it were to prove out that the reduction of long-term rates engendered by Fed policy had been used to unwittingly underwrite investment and job creation abroad, then the potential political costs relative to the benefit of further accommodation will have increased.\n\nAnother issue to be considered before embarking on a program to purchase additional long-term assets is whether such programs violate the basic tenets of the bedrock Bagehot principle, named for the 19th century British leader who “wrote the playbook” for central banking. Walter Bagehot advocated that when responding to a financial crisis, a central bank should lend freely at a penalty rate to anybody and everybody on good collateral. This was the principle we followed in addressing the Panic of 2008, and it was the right thing to do. While none of us are satisfied with the current pace of economic expansion and job creation, presently it is not clear that conditions warrant further crisis-like deployment of the Fed’s arsenal. Besides, it would be hard to build a case that the main recipient of further credit extensions, namely the U.S. Treasury, and borrowers whose rates are based on historically low spreads over Treasuries have difficulty accessing the capital markets.\n\nPart of our cost/benefit analysis should include where the inertia of quantitative easing might take us. Let’s go back to that eye-popping headline in the Wall Street Journal: “Central Banks Open Spigot.” The article led off with a discussion of the Bank of Japan’s announcement of a new bond-buying program. It prefaced this by noting that this round of the Bank of Japan’s quantitative easing was done “anticipating that the U.S. Federal Reserve will resume large-scale purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds and [in light of] strong domestic political pressure to spur growth and restrain a rising yen.” Referring to the fact that the BOJ would be buying real estate investment funds and exchange-traded funds, in addition to government bonds and corporate IOUs, it then quoted the governor of the bank, Masaaki Shirakawa—a thoughtful man and, incidentally, a member of the advisory board of the Dallas Fed’s Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute—as concluding: “If a central bank tries to seek greater impact from its monetary policy, there is no choice but to jump into such a world.” The article went on to say: “Central bankers elsewhere are strongly indicating that they are preparing to open credit spigots to reflate their economies at a time when fiscal policy is stalled or contracting.”\n\nMy reaction to reading that article was that it raises the specter of competitive quantitative easing. Such a race would be something of a one-off from competitive devaluation of currencies, a beggar-thy-neighbor phenomenon that always ends in tears. It implies that central banks should carry the load for stymied fiscal authorities—or worse, give in to them—rather than stick within their traditional monetary mandates and let legislative authorities deal with the fiscal mess they have created. It infers that lurking out in the future is a slippery slope of quantitative easing reaching beyond just buying government bonds (and in our case, mortgage-backed securities). It is one thing to stabilize the commercial paper market in a systematic way. Going beyond investment-grade paper, however, opens the door to pressure on a central bank to back financial instruments benefiting specific economic sectors. This inevitably leads to irritation or lobbying for similar treatment from economic sectors not blessed by similar monetary largess.\n\nIn his recent book titled Fault Lines, Raghuram Rajan reminds us that, “More always seems better to the impatient politician [policymaker]. But any instrument of government policy has its limitations, and what works in small doses can become a nightmare when scaled up, especially when scaled up quickly.… Furthermore, the private sector’s objectives are not the government’s objectives, and all too often, policies are set without taking this disparity into account. Serious unintended consequences can result.”[9]\n\nWhile all of us are impatient with the unemployment situation, it is worth bearing Rajan’s wry observations in mind. There is a great deal of legitimate debate still to take place within the FOMC on the subject of quantitative easing and the pros and cons and costs and benefits of further monetary accommodation. Whatever we might do, if anything, must of course be consistent with long-term price stability. But we also must avoid the unintended consequence of adding to the nightmare of confusing signals that job creators are already receiving from other government authorities.\n\nSo, what will we likely decide at the next FOMC meeting? As with the American League championship, you’ll find out when it’s over and only then.\n\nBefore concluding, I want to return to the TIC data I mentioned earlier. Yesterday, I asked a trader of sovereign debt how he interpreted the recent numbers. His answer: “We are still the best-looking horse in the glue factory.” It was a witty reply. But it was disturbing. This is America. Whether we are Ranger or Yankee fans, Texans or New Yorkers, we have been blessed to live in the most prosperous nation on earth. We cannot now accept simply being the “least worst” among major economies. We must be better than the rest.\n\nThis cannot be accomplished by the FOMC alone. Whatever we do with monetary policy will be of limited utility, if not counterproductive, unless it is complemented by sensible fiscal policy that restores confidence and puts the American people back to work. We are not glue-factory horses. We are thoroughbreds. It’s time to put us back on track.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "October 7, 2010 Minneapolis, Minnesota\n\nThank you, Congressman [Mark] Kennedy. You and Congressman [Tim] Penny are most kind to have invited me to speak here today. If I may, I would like to tip my hat to another former congressman who sits on your board, Bill Frenzel. Bill and my father-in-law served together for many years in Congress. Bill was a moderate; Jim [Collins] an ultra-conservative. And yet, back then, they worked closely together for the greater good and are exemplars for us all in these contentious political times. When I was deputy U.S. trade representative, I could always call on Bill to help guide me through the Ways and Means Committee, which he knew like the back of his hand. He used to say that “negotiating with Congress is a heck of a lot harder than negotiating with the Chinese.” He certainly got that right! Please give Bill my highest regards and thanks for being a good man.\n\nMy wife, Nancy, and I sent our children to a Concordia Language Village about a four-hour drive from here, a little south of Bemidji. I remember my daughter asking me: “Dad, I wonder why they call the lake near Walker ‘Leech Lake’?” My answer was: “You’ll find out soon enough.” And indeed she did.\n\nI have been asked to speak about the course of the U.S. economy. I do so with considerable humility, bearing in mind a lesson from one of my undergraduate professors, John Kenneth Galbraith, who taught me and his other students that “economic forecasting was invented to make astrology look respectable.”\n\nIt is rare that economists’ precise forecasts ever prove accurate. The iconic Bernard Baruch said it well: “If (economists) knew so much, they would have all the money and we would have none.”[1] Even with the advantages we at the Federal Reserve have, with our access to data and battalions of brilliant economists on our staffs that model and analyze it, we are not prescient. Making monetary policy as a central banker comes down to judgment, which must constantly be recalibrated and refined as we contemplate and make decisions. Today, I can only offer my best personal judgment as to where the U.S. economy is headed.\n\nAn analysis of the current predicament in the United States leads one to conclude that while the risks of a double-dip recession are receding, the pace of the recovery is obviously subpar.\n\nLate last year and in early 2010, we had a burst of growth led primarily by inventory adjustment. Real inventory accumulation rose from a minus $162 billion in the second quarter of 2009 to a plus $69 billion in the second quarter of 2010, a swing of $231 billion that accounted for approximately 61 percent of the 3 percent real GDP growth that we saw over that four-quarter period. With inventories now better aligned with sales, it is doubtful this variable will provide much economic propulsion in the coming quarters.\n\nTurning to final demand, the weak pace of recovery in U.S. export markets and political and budget realities mean that little near-term growth impetus can be expected from either net exports or government purchases. Only consumption and nonresidential fixed investment are likely to make positive contributions to the expansion. Yet, in these sectors, there is no reason to believe that growth will be notably strong. Residential investment, meanwhile, was an outright drag on growth last quarter, reflecting the hangover from expiring tax incentives. It has since shown signs of bottoming out but can hardly be expected to become a robust factor for the foreseeable future. On net, then, I see only modest third-quarter growth, with an acceleration to moderate growth after that.\n\nContemplating this scenario, the brow begins to furrow. The key pace of economic recovery is clearly insufficient to create the number of jobs the United States needs to bring down unemployment significantly in the foreseeable future. If we cannot generate enough new jobs to sufficiently absorb the labor force over the intermediate future, we cannot expect to grow final demand needed to achieve more rapid economic growth.\n\nIn the summation of the recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, released after we concluded our deliberations, it was crisply noted that “employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls.” At the same time, the Committee reported it saw no prospect on the foreseeable horizon for inflation—the bête noire of all central bankers—to raise its ugly head; neither was the bête rouge of deflation highlighted. Instead, in more convoluted syntax, the majority view of the Committee was summarized as follows: “Measures of underlying inflation are currently at levels somewhat below those the Committee judges most consistent, over the longer run, with its mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.” The statement concluded by saying that the FOMC was “prepared to provide additional accommodation if needed to support the economic recovery and to return inflation, over time, to levels consistent with its mandate.”[2]\n\nI am afraid that despite recent speculation in the press and among market pundits, we did little at that meeting to settle the debate as to whether the Committee might actually engage in further monetary accommodation, or what has become known in the parlance of Wall Street as “QE2,” a second round of quantitative easing. It would be marked by an expansion of our balance sheet beyond its current footings of $2.3 trillion through the purchase of additional Treasuries or other securities. To be sure, some in the marketplace—including those with the most to gain financially—read the tea leaves of the statement as indicating a bias toward further asset purchases, executed either in small increments or in a “shock-and-awe” format entailing large buy-ins, leaving open only the question of when.\n\nSince the FOMC meeting, a handful of my colleagues have fanned further speculation about QE2 by signaling their personal positions on the matter quite openly in recent speeches and interviews in the major newspapers. Hence the headline in yesterday’s Wall Street Journal, “Central Banks Open Spigot,”[3] a declaration that surely gave the ghosts of central bankers past the shivers and sent a tingle down the spine of gold bugs from Bemidji to Beijing.\n\nI very much share the concerns of my colleagues who fret that unemployment is not receding quickly enough. (I spent too much of my childhood with a father who, bless his soul, often struggled to find work.) Given that we at the Fed are mandated to maintain price stability and create the monetary conditions to encourage maximum employment growth—at a time when inflation is “somewhat below” what the Committee as a whole judges appropriate—I instinctively understand the impulse to put the monetary pedal to the metal to try to move the needle on employment growth. And yet the efficacy of further accommodation at this point has yet to be established.\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve buys Treasuries to drive down yields, it adds money to the financial system. In sharp contrast to the depths of the Panic of 2008, when liquidity had evaporated and we stepped into the breach to revive it, today there is abundant liquidity in our economy. The excess reserves of private banks parked at the 12 Federal Reserve Banks exceed $1 trillion. Nonfinancial corporations have an aggregate liquid asset ratio running at a seven-year high; cash flow from current production is running above total investment expenditure; cash as a percentage of market cap is extraordinarily high. Credit availability remains a challenge for small businesses, but only 4 percent of small businesses surveyed by the National Federation of Independent Business reported financing as their top business problem.[4] And reports of lagging receivables or the stretching out of payment terms that were so prominent only one year ago in the corporate supply chain have become as scarce as hens’ teeth.\n\nHowever one may view the prominence of credit constraints for small businesses, it is unclear whether broad monetary actions will alleviate them; it might be more appropriate, perhaps, for the Treasury to undertake a targeted fiscal initiative to improve credit availability to small businesses. For mid- and large-sized nonfinancial firms, capital is fairly abundant in America, and it is unclear how much they would benefit from lowering Treasury interest rates.\n\nThe vexing question is: Why isn’t this liquidity being utilized to hire new workers and reduce unemployment? Why is it that, as pointed out in Alan Greenspan’s op-ed in this morning’s Financial Times, the share of liquid cash flow allocated to long-term fixed asset investment has fallen to its lowest level in the 58 years for which data are available?[5] If current dramatically high levels of liquidity and low interest rates are not being harnessed to add to payrolls or expand capital expenditures, would driving interest rates further down and adding further liquidity to the system through Fed purchases of Treasury securities induce U.S. businesses and consumers to get on with spending it?\n\nThe intrepid theoretical economist would argue in the affirmative, the logic being that there is a tipping point at which the market becomes convinced that money held in reserve earning negligible returns is at risk of being debased through some inflation and, thus, should be spent rather than hoarded. Hence, the appeal of the Fed’s showing a little leg of inflationary permissiveness, as suggested in the recent declarations of some of my colleagues.\n\nThere is some sound theory behind these arguments. Yet, my soundings among those who actually do the work of creating sustainable jobs and making productive capital investments—private businesses big and small—indicate that few are willing to commit to expanding U.S. payrolls or to undertaking significant commitments to expand capital expenditures in the U.S. other than in areas that enhance productivity of the current workforce. Without exception, all the business leaders I interview cite nonmonetary factors—fiscal policy and regulatory constraints or, worse, uncertainty going forward—and better opportunities for earning a return on investment elsewhere as inhibiting their willingness to commit to expansion in the U.S. As the CEO of one medium-sized business put it to me shortly before the last FOMC, “Part of it is uncertainty: We just don’t know what the new regulations [sic] like health care are going to cost and what the new rules will be. Part of it is certainty: We know that taxes are eventually going to have to increase to get us out of the fiscal hole Republicans and Democrats alike have dug for us, and we know that regulatory intervention will be getting more intense.” Small wonder that most business leaders I survey, including small businesses, remain fixated on driving productivity and lowering costs, budgeting to “get less people to wear more hats.” Tax and regulatory uncertainty—combined with a now well-inculcated culture of driving all resources, including labor, to their most productive use at least cost—does not bode well for a rapid diminution of unemployment and the concomitant expansion of demand.\n\nSo, it is indeed true that some economic theories would lead one to believe we can shake job creation from the trees if we were to further expand our balance sheet. Yet, to paraphrase the early 20th century progressive, Clarence Day—the once ubiquitous contributor to my favorite magazine, The New Yorker, and author of one of my all-time favorite films, Life with Father—“Too many (theorists) begin with a dislike of reality.”[6] The reality of fiscal and regulatory policy inhibiting the transmission mechanism of monetary policy is most definitely present and is vexing to monetary policy makers.

            "content": "October 1, 2010 Vancouver, British Columbia\n\nOn September 11, 2001, I was on a flight returning from the celebration of the opening of the Jewish Museum in Berlin two days earlier. We were approaching New York City as the World Trade Center was attacked and were rerouted to Toronto. As one of the first planes to land in Canada, we were held on the tarmac for some time, having only been told we had been prevented from landing in New York because of “severe headwinds.” After deplaning and going through an extensive screening process, we were finally briefed on what little was known at the time of the horrors of that day. We finally exited the airport to find hundreds of cars of private citizens who had spontaneously massed and come to the airport to take any and all of their American brethren into their homes and care for us while we waited anxiously to learn more of what had happened and why.\n\nThat afternoon, I somehow managed to get through by phone to my wife, Nancy. She was hiding in the basement of a home in Washington, D.C., with our two youngest children. With the passage of time, it is easy to forget how chaotic and frightful that day was. Nancy was in Georgetown, a stone’s throw from the Pentagon. It was unclear if all of Washington was under attack; rumors abounded that the Capitol and the White House were targeted. I wanted to make sure my wife and children were safe. She reported they were and then asked if I was. I remember saying, “I am safe in the hands of our Canadian brothers and sisters.” This is the first time I have had a formal chance to say it, so I am taking the liberty of doing so: Thank you for the compassion and unconditional friendship you and your countrymen showed the United States on that infamous day. For the rest of my life, Canada will hold a special place in my heart.\n\nI am delighted to be in this magnificent, thriving city of Vancouver. My son Miles—the one who was huddled in the basement with his mom and little sister on September 11—is filming his first lead role in a movie here as we speak. It is a Warner Brothers film titled Final Destination 5, due for release next summer. So, of course, I am hoping Vancouver will be the launching point for my being able to retire in comfort. And this is the home of two of my favorite musicians, Diana Krall and her husband, the eclectically talented Elvis Costello, who works closely with and is highly regarded by the Dallas Symphony Orchestra. I am especially honored to speak to the Vancouver Board of Trade and to have been introduced by Jason [McLean]. This body has long been a forceful advocate for private enterprise and for limited and effective government involvement in economic activity. The ethic here is very compatible with the successful economic practices of my home state of Texas.\n\nI have been asked to speak about the course of the U.S. economy. Before doing so, let me provide some disclaimers.\n\nFirst, as is the practice of all senior Federal Reserve officials, I speak only for myself as but one of 18 who presently participate in Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) deliberations. I do not speak for the others on the FOMC, and they do not speak for me.\n\nSecond, I do so bearing in mind a lesson from a Canadian turned Harvard professor, John Kenneth Galbraith, who taught me and his other students that “economic forecasting was invented to make astrology look respectable.”\n\nIt is rare that economists’ precise forecasts ever prove accurate. As the iconic Bernard Baruch said so well: “If [economists] knew so much, they would have all the money and we would have none.”[1] Even with the advantages we at the Federal Reserve have, with our access to data and battalions of brilliant economists on our staffs that model and analyze it, we are not prescient. Making monetary policy as a central banker comes down to judgment, which must constantly be recalibrated and refined as we contemplate and make decisions. Today, I can only offer my best personal judgment as to where the U.S. economy is headed.\n\nAn analysis of the current predicament in the United States leads one to conclude that while the risks of a double-dip recession are small, the pace of the recovery is subpar. Late last year and in early 2010, we had a burst of growth led primarily by inventory adjustment. Real inventory accumulation rose from a minus $162 billion in the second quarter of 2009 to a plus $63 billion in the second quarter of 2010, a swing of $225 billion that accounted for approximately 60 percent of the 3 percent real GDP growth that we saw over that four-quarter period. With inventories now better aligned with sales, it is doubtful this variable will provide much economic propulsion in the coming quarters.\n\nTurning to final demand, the weak pace of recovery in U.S. export markets and political and budget realities mean that little near-term growth impetus can be expected from either net exports or government purchases. Only consumption and nonresidential fixed investment are likely to make positive contributions to expansion. Yet, in these sectors, there is no reason to believe that growth will be notably strong. Residential investment, meanwhile, was an outright drag on growth last quarter, reflecting the hangover from expiring tax incentives. It has since shown signs of bottoming out but can hardly be expected to become a robust factor for the foreseeable future. On net, then, I see only modest third-quarter growth, with an acceleration to moderate growth after that.\n\nThe key point is that the pace of the economic recovery is insufficient to create the number of jobs the United States needs to bring down unemployment.\n\nIf we cannot generate enough new jobs to absorb the labor force, we cannot expect to grow final demand needed to achieve more rapid economic growth. In the summation of the deliberations of the FOMC last week, it was crisply noted that “employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls.” At the same time, the Committee reported it saw no prospect on the foreseeable horizon for inflation—the bête noire of all central bankers—to raise its ugly head; neither was the bête rouge of deflation highlighted. Instead, in more convoluted syntax, the majority view of the Committee was summarized as follows: “Measures of underlying inflation are currently at levels somewhat below those the Committee judges most consistent, over the longer run, with its mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.” The statement concluded by saying that the FOMC was “prepared to provide additional accommodation if needed to support the economic recovery and to return inflation, over time, to levels consistent with its mandate.”[2]\n\nI am afraid that despite recent speculation in the press and among market pundits, we did little to settle the debate as to whether the Committee might actually engage in further monetary accommodation, or what has become known in the parlance of Wall Street as “QE2,” a second round of quantitative easing. It would be marked by an expansion of our balance sheet beyond its current footings of $2.3 trillion through the purchase of additional Treasuries or other securities. To be sure, some in the marketplace—including those with the most to gain financially—read the tea leaves of the statement as indicating a bias toward further asset purchases, executed either in small increments or in a “shock-and-awe” format entailing large buy-ins, leaving open only the question of when. At least one renowned investor noted in a widely reported CNBC interview that the FOMC’s release meant “we (the Fed) want economic growth, and we don’t care if there’s inflation.” He asked pointedly: “Have they ever said that before?”[3] For many, the FOMC’s pronouncement was interpreted as confirming the promise of a “Fed put,” implying that the greater the economy’s weakness, the more easy money the Fed will provide.\n\nAnd yet the efficacy of further accommodation at this point is not crystal clear. When the Federal Reserve buys Treasuries to drive down yields, it adds money to the financial system. In sharp contrast to the depths of the Panic of 2008, when liquidity had evaporated and we stepped into the breach to revive it, today there is abundant liquidity in our economy. The excess reserves of private banks sitting on the balance sheets of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks exceed $1 trillion. Nonfinancial corporations have an aggregate liquid asset ratio running at a seven-year high; cash flow from current production is running above total investment expenditure; and cash as a percentage of market cap is extraordinarily high. Credit availability remains a challenge for small businesses, but only 4 percent of small businesses surveyed by the National Federation of Independent Business reported financing as their top business problem.[4] And reports of lagging receivables or the stretching out of payment terms that were so prominent only one year ago in the corporate supply chain have become as scarce as hens’ teeth.\n\nHowever one may view the prominence of credit constraints for small businesses, it is unclear whether broad monetary actions will alleviate them; it may be more appropriate for the Treasury to undertake a targeted fiscal initiative to improve credit availability to small businesses. For mid- and large-sized nonfinancial firms, capital is fairly abundant in America, and it is unclear how much they would benefit from lowering Treasury interest rates.\n\nThe vexing question is: Why isn’t this liquidity being utilized to hire new workers and reduce unemployment? If current dramatically high levels of liquidity and low interest rates are not being harnessed to add to payrolls, would driving interest rates further down and adding further liquidity to the system through Fed purchases of Treasury securities induce businesses and consumers to get on with spending it?\n\nThe intrepid economist would argue in the affirmative, the logic being that there is a tipping point at which the market becomes convinced that money held in reserve earning negligible returns is at risk of being debased through some inflation and, thus, should be spent rather than hoarded. Hence, the appeal of the Fed’s showing a little leg of inflationary permissiveness.\n\nI am personally wary of this argument, despite its theoretical logic. My soundings among those who actually do the work of creating sustainable jobs and making productive capital investments—private businesses big and small—indicate that few are willing to commit to expanding U.S. payrolls or to undertaking significant commitments to expand capital expenditures in the U.S. other than in areas that enhance productivity of the current workforce. Without exception, all the business leaders I interview cite nonmonetary factors—fiscal policy and regulatory constraints or, worse, uncertainty going forward—and better opportunities for earning a return on investment elsewhere as inhibiting their willingness to commit to expansion in the U.S. As the CEO of one medium-sized business put it to me shortly before the last FOMC meeting, “Part of it is uncertainty: We just don’t know what the new reg[ulation]s [sic] like health care are going to cost and what the new rules will be. Part of it is certainty: We know that taxes are eventually going to have to increase to get us out of the fiscal hole Republicans and Democrats alike have dug for us, and we know that regulatory intervention will be getting more intense.” Small wonder that most business leaders I survey, including small businesses, remain fixated on driving productivity and lowering costs, budgeting to “get less people to wear more hats.” Tax and regulatory uncertainty—combined with a now well-inculcated culture of driving all resources, including labor, to their most productive use at least cost—does not bode well for a rapid diminution of unemployment and the concomitant expansion of demand.\n\nThe Fed operates under a dual mandate that charges us with both keeping prices stable and maintaining maximum sustainable employment. Some economic theories would lead one to believe we could shake job creation from the trees if we were to further expand our balance sheet. Yet, to paraphrase the early 20th century progressive, Clarence Day—the once ubiquitous contributor to my favorite magazine, The New Yorker, and author of one of my all-time favorite films, Life with Father—“Too many [theorists] begin with a dislike of reality.”[5] The reality of fiscal and regulatory policy inhibiting the transmission mechanism of monetary policy is vexing to monetary theorists. And yet it seems to me to be a significant factor holding back economic recovery.\n\nOne of my brightest and most intellectually credentialed colleagues, Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Minneapolis Fed, has noted that one of our deep-seated problems is structural unemployment—that we do not have a workforce adequate to the needs of the high-value-added businesses that define the U.S. “Firms have jobs but can’t find appropriate workers,” he says. And he concludes, “It is hard to see how the Fed can do much to cure this problem.”[6] I would add that if this is true, then the matching of job skills to needs is doubly complicated if businesses feel handicapped by the current tax and regulatory regime or find other countries better placed to expand in a globalized, cyber-ized economy that encourages investment to gravitate to optimal locations for enhancing return on investment.\n\nIn my darkest moments, in fact, I wonder if the monetary accommodation we have engineered might not be working in the wrong places. Far too many of the large corporations I survey report that the most effective way to deploy cheap money raised in the current bond markets or in the form of loans from banks, beyond buying in stock or expanding dividends, is to invest it abroad where taxes are lower and governments are more eager to please. This would not be of concern if foreign direct investment in the U.S. were offsetting this impulse. This year, net direct investment in the U.S. has been running at a pace that would exceed minus $200 billion, meaning outflows of foreign direct investment are exceeding inflows by a healthy margin. We will have to watch the data as it unfolds to see if this is momentary fillip or evidence of a broader trend. But I wonder: If others cotton to the view that “(the Fed) doesn’t care about inflation,” or begin to question whether we at the FOMC can slice the apple so precisely as to maintain inflation at a rate between what is now “somewhat below” that which is “most consistent with [our] mandate”—say 1 percent—and a level that is more consistent with the mandate—say 2 percent—might this not add to the uncertainty already created by the fiscal incontinence of Congress and the regulatory and rule-making “excesses” about which businesses now complain?\n\nIn his much-noted speech at Jackson Hole in August, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke spoke of the need to evaluate the costs as well as the benefits of further monetary accommodation.\n\nIn performing a cost/benefit analysis of a possible QE2, we will need to bear in mind that one cost that has already been incurred in the process of running an easy money policy has been to drive down the returns earned by savers, especially those who do not have the means or sophistication or the demographic profile to place their money at risk further out in the yield curve or who are wary of the inherent risk of stocks. A great many baby boomers or older cohorts who played by the rules, saved their money and have migrated over time, as prudent investment counselors advise, to short- to intermediate-dated, fixed-income instruments, are earning extremely low nominal and real returns on their savings. Further reductions in rates earned on savings will hardly endear the Fed to this portion of the population. Moreover, driving down bond yields might force increased pension contributions from corporations and state and local governments, decreasing the deployment of monies toward job maintenance in the public sector. Debasing those savings with even a little more inflation than what is above minimal levels acceptable to the FOMC is unlikely to endear the Fed to these citizens. And if—and here I especially stress the word if because the evidence is thus far only anecdotal and has yet to be confirmed by longer-term data—if it were to prove out that the reduction of long-term rates engendered by Fed policy had been used to unwittingly underwrite investment and job creation abroad, particularly in countries where exchange-rate adjustment is inhibited, then the potential political costs relative to the benefit of further accommodation will have increased.\n\nAnother issue to be considered before embarking on a program to purchase additional long-term assets is whether such programs violate the basic tenets of the bedrock Bagehot principle, named for the 19th century British leader who “wrote the playbook” for central banking. Walter Bagehot advocated that when responding to a financial crisis, a central bank should lend freely at a penalty rate to anybody and everybody on good collateral. This was the principle we followed in addressing the Panic of 2008, and it was the right thing to do. While none of us are satisfied with the current pace of economic expansion and job creation, presently it is not clear that conditions warrant further crisis-like deployment of the Fed’s arsenal. Besides, it would be difficult to build a case that the main recipient of further credit extensions, namely the U.S. Treasury, or borrowers whose rates are based on historically low spreads over Treasuries, have difficulty accessing the capital markets.\n\nSo I confess that, at least in my mind, it is not clear that the benefits of further quantitative easing outweigh the costs, especially if the economic scenario I outlined at the beginning of these comments obtains.\n\nWhat I envision from the current vantage point is an anemic recovery, but not one that slips into reverse gear. Thus, barring an unforeseen shock, I have concerns about the efficacy of further expanding the Fed’s balance sheet until our political authorities better align fiscal and regulatory initiatives with the needs of job creators. Otherwise, further quantitative easing might be pushing on a string. In the worst case, it could flood the engine of the economy with gas that might later ignite inflation.\n\nOf course, if the fiscal and regulatory authorities are able to dispel the angst that businesses are reporting, further accommodation might not even be needed. If job-creating businesses are more certain about future policy and are satisfactorily incentivized, they are more likely to take advantage of low interest rates, release the liquidity they are hoarding and invest it robustly in hiring and training a workforce that will propel the American economy to new levels of prosperity, rendering moot the argument for QE2. The key is to first remove or reduce the tax and regulatory uncertainties that act as an impediment to businesses responding to an increase in final demand. I consider this to be a far more desirable outcome than being saddled with a bloated Fed balance sheet.\n\nThat is the view from the Dallas Fed.\n\nThank you, Peter [Brown], for inviting me to be one of the Board of Trade’s “Distinguished Speakers.” I should tell you that last night I turned to my wife and asked, “In your wildest dreams did you ever envision my being a Distinguished Speaker for a forum as prestigious as the Vancouver Board of Trade, following in the footsteps of Prime Minister Goh, Prince Philip, President Zedillo and President Clinton?” This was her reply: “I hate to let you down, Richard, but after 37 years of marriage, you rarely appear in my wildest dreams.”\n\nThank you all.",

            "content": "September 1, 2010 Houston, Texas\n\nThank you, Jodie [Jiles]. When I close my eyes and listen to you and that rich, resonant voice, I hear the cadence and passion of a great preacher. When I open my eyes, I see Jodie Jiles the accountant. Jodie, you may be the only “compassionate accountant” on the planet! I thank you for being a man of exacting precision while still possessing a great big heart. I thank you for serving the Houston Branch of the Dallas Fed with constant dedication in reminding us that we serve all the people of Texas and America, regardless of their economic status. And I thank you for that kind introduction.\n\nI recently saw a sign in a shop window in West Texas that said “Lord, please give me just one chance … to prove that money can’t buy happiness.” Well, we all know that money can’t buy happiness, but it sure helps. (I think it was W. Somerset Maugham who said, “Money is like a sixth sense without which you cannot make a complete use of the other five.”) Today, I would like to talk about money from the perspective of monetary policy. What is the Federal Reserve’s responsibility and what can the Fed do at this critical juncture to brighten the economic picture and bring about a happier circumstance?\n\nEverything I say today reflects my own views. I never attempt to speak for others at the Fed; I always speak of my own volition. Given that I rotate into a formal voting member’s slot on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) next year, I thought it might be of interest if I outlined how I see things moving forward.\n\nFinancial Stability\n\nFor starters, I think it important to dispel the concept that the Fed has only a “dual” mandate.\n\nTo be sure, we are responsible under the Federal Reserve Act for creating the monetary conditions that foster full employment and price stability; I will turn to that critical dual mission in a minute. But we also have the responsibility to preserve financial stability. Delivering on our obligation to ensure financial stability is an important prerequisite for executing our duties under the Act. Thus, while it is not formally stated as such, ensuring financial stability is an assumed mandate of the Fed. Understanding that this, too, is the purpose of a central bank will help you understand why we acted as we did to address the Financial Panic of 2008 and what we might or might not do as we seek now to harness monetary policy to restore economic growth.\n\nI think most everyone is aware of the actions the Fed has undertaken since the trip-wire event of Lehman’s failure. I do want to remind you, however, that what we faced then was a full-blown liquidity crisis. No financial counterparty was willing to trust, or lend to, another. The interbank lending, commercial paper and asset-backed securities markets ceased to function; money market funds “broke the buck;” the stock and bond markets were in a tailspin; the mortgage markets were in total disarray. In response, the Fed did what central bankers have done since the iconic Walter Bagehot wrote the rule book for responding to financial panics of the 19th century. We jumped into the breach as the lender of last resort.[1]\n\nThis was nervous-making for many. It required that we create and deploy programs totaling trillions of dollars to restore stability to the key markets, providing liquidity to banks and businesses. As it turned out, these emergency interventions by the Fed were effective. And, most important, once they had done their job, we wound them down and closed them up. Let me repeat that: All the emergency liquidity facilities that the Federal Reserve instituted were closed down and did not cost the taxpayers of this great country a single dime. Indeed, last year, as we finished up this work, the Federal Reserve paid $47.4 billion in profits to the Treasury. Imagine that! A government agency that (a) created programs that actually worked as promised, (b) made money for the taxpayers in the process and (c) undid the programs—all in the space of about 28 months—once they had done their job.\n\nI mention this to illustrate a couple of points.\n\nFirst, we take our job seriously. We are the central bank of the most powerful and important economy in the world. We bear significant responsibility as the lender of last resort. We have the power to create money. This is an awesome power. We are not afraid to use it. It requires that we discharge our duties deliberately. If we fail to act when action is required, we might be the agent of economic destruction. And if we overreact, we can be equally destructive. Which means we must at all times carefully weigh the costs, as well as the benefits, of any and all actions we take. And as the efficacy of our actions depends upon confidence in our integrity, we must always bear in mind that our word is our bond. We cannot risk either overpromising or undercommitting to executing the duties than have been assigned to us.\n\nSecond, I mention this responsibility by way of pointing out that the situation we face now is far different from that which we faced in 2008. Then, banks were at risk of not having access to capital; now they have over $1 trillion in excess reserves on deposit at the 12 Federal Reserve banks. Then, nonfinancial businesses feared the capital markets would be closed to them; now, the bond markets for publicly traded companies are significantly improved and quite robust (IBM recently issued three-year paper with a 1 percent coupon and, just last week, Norfolk Southern Corp. issued a 100-year bond with a 6 percent coupon); presently, significant amounts of working capital are lying fallow on the balance sheets of the larger firms. Then, the S&P 500 index was cascading to close at 676 on March 9 of 2009; yesterday, despite recent retracement, it closed 55 percent higher at 1,049. Then, small businesses faced being cut off from banks and other forms of non-publicly issued sources of capital; this July, of small businesses seeking credit, the National Federation of Independent Business reported that only 9 percent did not have their credit needs met and only 4 percent mentioned the availability of credit as a significant issue.[2]\n\nI think one could reasonably state that when fear reached a feverish pitch and was crippling the most basic financial markets, the Fed acted appropriately and effectively to restore them.\n\nThat said, we are not in the financial pink. Consumers are still under financial duress, and while our most recent survey of senior loan officers indicates banks are beginning to ease credit standards, they are not necessarily expanding credit. The bottom line is that what is restraining the economy is not a shortage of current liquidity; rather, it is uncertainty, high household debt burdens and a lack of confidence in future income growth.\n\nIncomes plunged in 2008 and into early 2009. Since then, growth has resumed. But the gap between where we are now and where we would have been had we cruised along at the long-term rate of nominal growth of 4 or 4.5 percent—consistent with 2.5 percent average real growth and 1.5 to 2 percent inflation—is large and is not narrowing. By our calculation at the Dallas Fed, nominal income is over 9 percent lower than where it would have been had we not been blown off course by the Panic of 2008. With incomes falling short, households have found themselves overburdened with debt. Compounding the problem, the Conference Board’s consumer survey shows households expecting income increases over the next six months to be outnumbered by those expecting decreases. This pessimism about income prospects has continued, without interruption, since the collapse of Lehman Brothers. It is unprecedented in depth and duration in the 44 years the survey has been conducted.\n\nAs Jodie mentioned, I was a midshipman at the U.S. Naval Academy. One of the basic lessons learned in navigation courses at Annapolis is that if a storm has blown your ship off course, you don’t simply resume your old compass heading. You make an adjustment to offset the effects of the blow and you beat a course accordingly. We need monetary and fiscal policies that bring economic growth back up to speed and, over the next few years, begin to close the income gap that opened up during the storms of 2008 and early 2009. Without such policies, progress in deleveraging the balance sheets of households and businesses will be painfully slow and our nation’s recovery will be drawn out longer than necessary.\n\nPrice Stability\n\nOn the price front, I am known as an inflation hawk. I am comfortable with that description. As I have pointed out many times, ornithologists classify doves as being from the pigeon family. I do not wish to be anybody’s pigeon, and nothing I just said about desiring faster income growth should lead you to think I have gone soft on inflation. Nor am I alone in my firm commitment to keeping inflation under control: You may have noted Chairman Ben Bernanke’s unequivocal statement last week in Jackson Hole, Wyo., that he sees “no support” within the FOMC for increasing its medium-term inflation goals above levels consistent with price stability.[3] But it is clear that inflation is not the immediate problem facing the nation. As pointed out by the chairman, inflation has declined to a level that is at the low end of the 1.5 to 2 percent range that the participants in FOMC deliberations consider conducive for healthy economic growth over the long run.\n\nThe Dallas Fed, which as might be expected, being Texan, has a separate and distinct way of calculating inflation. We use a trimmed-mean analysis.[4] In studying the entrails of the price index for consumer expenditures (the PCE), at present we see neither an impulse toward inflation nor, despite much talk among economists and political pundits, toward deflation. Trimmed mean inflation rates recorded over the last three months have been slightly above the rates we saw in early spring, and the index’s six- and 12-month inflation rates have been stable over the past three months. Within the core PCE index, rates of price change for two of the largest components—rent and owners’ equivalent rent—have lately turned from falling to rising. That change of direction alone should, in the near term, provide some restraint against further disinflation in core PCE. In short, I concur with Chairman Bernanke’s assessment that “the risk of either an undesirable rise in inflation or of a significant further disinflation seems low.”[5]\n\nFull Employment\n\nWith the efficacy of most financial markets reasonably restored and inflation subdued, the question then is how the Federal Reserve might best do its part to restore employment growth.\n\nHere’s the rub. Note that I say, “Do its part.” The Fed is not the end-all for curing every economic pathology. To return to my naval analogy, we are not the only authority in the pilot house. We play a crucial role in conditioning the economy, but we do not play the only role. Fiscal and regulatory authorities share significant responsibility for incentivizing economic behavior through taxes, spending and rulemaking.\n\nWith this in mind, I have been outspoken about what I refer to as “random refereeing,” by which I mean the tendency for lawmakers and rule makers to create programs that hinder, rather than advance, the incentive for the private sector to expand its payrolls. I spoke of this recently in San Antonio, noting that among the CEOs I regularly survey before every FOMC meeting—leaders of companies nationwide that vary in size from nine employees to over a million and represent a broad cross section of goods and service companies—the prevailing sentiment is that politicians and officials who craft and enforce taxes and rules have been doing so in a capricious manner that makes long-term planning, including expanding payrolls, difficult, if not impossible.[6]\n\nJust last week, I sat in on a financial planning and budgeting discussion with middle managers of one of America’s leading consumer goods producers. Asked directly how they determine the all-in cost of an employee, the CFO replied, “We can’t. We can’t because we don’t know what will happen on the tax front or with social overhead.” So their current plan is to withhold payroll expansion in the United States while investing their growing cash reserves in driving productivity enhancement from their current crop of over 200,000 employees, of which about 70,000 are located in the United States. Meanwhile, they are searching to expand their operations in other countries that “offer better incentives, stability and a more entrepreneurial environment.” The sentiment expressed by this CFO is not atypical. A careful reader of the minutes of the last FOMC meeting will note that several participants in the committee’s deliberations “reported that business contacts again indicated that uncertainty about future taxes, regulations, and health-care costs made them reluctant to expand their workforces. Instead, businesses had continued to meet growth in demand for their products largely through productivity gains and by increasing existing employees’ hours.” This does not bode well for job creation here at home.[7]\n\nThe retarding effect of heightened uncertainty over the fiscal and regulatory direction of the country makes it difficult to kick-start the transmission mechanism of the economy. One might reasonably posit that the gas tank of those who have the capacity to hire—the private-sector businesses of America—is reasonably full. And one might conclude that the Fed, having cut the cost of interbank overnight lending to near zero and used quantitative easing to coax the entire yield curve downward, has driven the cost of gas to virtually nil for both the government and those businesses that are creditworthy.\n\nThe issue now is how that fuel might be released so as to propel the engine of job creation and drive a happier pace of economic growth.\n\nThis does not mean that the actions of the Fed going forward are unimportant or that our job is ever done. At the last meeting of the FOMC, we collectively decided to reinvest the proceeds of payments from our portfolio of mortgage-backed securities into longer-term Treasury securities, thus keeping constant the size of our portfolio and avoiding a possible passive reduction in monetary accommodation. In part, this represents a recognition that the performance of the economy is sub-par and we wish to “do no harm” to the process of repair.\n\nThe former NFL quarterback and present sports anchor for the CBS affiliate in Dallas–Fort Worth, Babe Laufenberg, recently reminded me that in football, “momentum is not a light switch.” It cannot be turned on in an instant; it needs to build throughout the season. At a minimum, we need to let the slight momentum of the current economic recovery build and do nothing to disrupt it.\n\nAs for doing more than avoiding passive tightening in an attempt to goose up that momentum, much will depend on the cost–benefit trade-off of utilizing any of the additional tools in our kit. I think it is abundantly clear to the market that regardless of the language the FOMC employs to describe its deliberations and intentions, the consensus of the committee is to keep the price of money—the cost of the gas needed for our nation’s economic engine—low until the committee is confident that the gears of the economy have begun to mesh more robustly.\n\nWhich focuses attention on the size of our balance sheet and whether we will expand it. Personally, I would be reluctant to do so unless or until fiscal and regulatory initiatives are aligned with the needs of job creators. Otherwise, further accommodation might be pushing on a string. In the worst case, it could flood the engine of the economy with gas that might later ignite inflation. Of course, if the fiscal and regulatory authorities are able to dispel the angst that they are reportedly causing, further accommodation may not be needed because the liquidity that has been built up on corporate balance sheets and in the excess reserves of banks might then be released into the economy and spur job creation.\n\nFor me, the ball is in the fiscal court for now. Any further action by the Fed must be subject to the kind of rigorous cost–benefit analysis that Ben Bernanke cited in Jackson Hole. One of the variables that must be taken into account is whether fiscal and regulatory policies are conducive to growth.\n\nReturning to the sign in that West Texas shop, I believe that monetary accommodation alone cannot buy happiness. I am as keen as anyone on providing the monetary means to make the engine of the American economy hum once again. We need to get back on the path of narrowing the gap between income growth and what the American people hoped and planned for when they charted the course of future income streams needed to meet their financial obligations, conduct their businesses and care for their families.\n\nAs with individuals, for the economy to be truly content, it must have confidence in itself and in the future. I believe the Fed should employ every tool it has available to make that possible. But it is important to recognize that we cannot do it alone. The best way to leverage the influence of monetary policy is to have fiscal and regulatory policy that complements, rather than counters, the impact we might have in helping the economy get back on the course of sustained, noninflationary growth.",

            "content": "July 29, 2010 San Antonio, Texas\n\nJim Goudge has been of enormous help to the Dallas Fed over the years, serving first as a member of the board of our San Antonio Branch and more recently as a member of the Federal Advisory Council, a body that consists of a banker from each of the 12 Federal Reserve Districts and advises the Federal Reserve Board about banking conditions nationwide. Before I get started, I want to thank you, Jim, for your devoted service to our nation’s central bank. And I thank you for that kind introduction.\n\nJim asked me here today to provide some comments on the current economic situation. That is no simple task. My undergraduate economics professor John Kenneth Galbraith used to say that “the only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable.” Economic prognostications need to be taken with a grain of salt, even when delivered by Federal Reserve officials, for they are seldom accurate and are subject to constant revisions. But this much I know: Economic growth is no longer being aided by the inventory correction that propelled the economy in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. And software and equipment purchases are closer to catching up with demand. Against this background, recent relatively weak data indicating slower manufacturing growth, a dyspeptic housing sector and continuing consumer anxiety point to a slightly weaker national outlook, with growth from the first quarter onward likely to fall below 3 percent for a prolonged period.\n\nRecent data from the Eleventh District are also a mixed bag. Year-to-date through June, our fellow Texans have accounted for over 18 percent of the nation’s overall private-sector job creation and about 44 percent of jobs created in the goods-producing sector. So we have been lucky puppies. While commercial real estate and recent readings from the Dallas Fed’s Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey (which was released on Monday) are weak, exports have been on an upward trend, and we’ve seen positive employment growth, especially in the energy, construction and—despite a significant drop in consumer confidence for the month of June—retail sectors. Job growth in Texas for 2010 is forecasted between 2.5 and 3 percent, which implies around 250,000 to 300,000 new jobs.\n\nAt both the national and regional levels, despite a series of hiccups and roadblocks, we continue our slow slog out of what proved to be a most hellish downturn in 2008 and 2009. I expect the economic expansion to continue, buoyed by slow and admittedly bumpy improvements in the labor market, increases in business and household spending, and resilience in entrepreneurial hot spots like Texas. But, on net, I fear the nation’s economy will be sailing forward at suboptimal speed, despite the fact that the cost of borrowing is low, equity markets have shown resilience and liquidity is plentiful on corporate balance sheets and in the form of excess reserves in the banking system.\n\nFor some time now in internal discussions with my colleagues at the Fed, I have ascribed the economy’s slow growth pathology to what I call “random refereeing”—the current predilection of government to rewrite the rules in the middle of the game of recovery. Businesses and consumers are being confronted with so many potential changes in the taxes and regulations that govern their behavior that they are uncertain about how to proceed downfield. Awaiting clearer signals from the referees that are the nation’s fiscal authorities and regulators, they have gone into a defensive crouch.\n\nIn the past few weeks, the popular press has expounded upon this theme. Articles about the price of uncertainty have come from seemingly all corners, with everyone from Mort Zuckerman in the Financial Times to Fareed Zakaria in the Washington Post to David Leonhardt in the New York Times complaining about how uncertainty perpetrated by fiscal and regulatory authorities is undermining economic expansion.[1] Writing in the Wall Street Journal about the banking industry’s concerns with the unfinished business of the recently enacted financial regulatory reform legislation, David Reilly summed up the situation well: “Certainty … will give banks clear targets,” he said. “Not knowing [the outcome] is arguably the worst of all worlds.”[2]\n\nThis view is by no means unique to bankers. Private-sector operators—the most efficient creators of sustainable, long-term economic growth and innovation—find themselves stymied as the rules of the road remain ambiguous and the outcome or the full effect of recently enacted legislation and regulation remains unknown.\n\nCapitalism works best when people take sensible, calculated risks in innovating and conducting normal economic activity. Uncertainty and risk are natural parts of business—capitalists handicap and deal with them every day. However, excessive uncertainty hinders one’s ability to even calculate the odds of potential outcomes—especially when that uncertainty involves irreversible decisions with long-term implications.\n\nOperating a business under conditions of excessive uncertainty is like playing a game when you don’t know the rules. Without rules, it is impossible to develop a strategy or playbook. Business leaders are forced to call a time-out: They remove their players from the field and anxiously wait on the sidelines until they have a better idea how to play the game. Too much uncertainty can create economic stasis as more and more decisions get delayed, retarding commitments to expansion of payrolls and capital expenditures and slowing the entire economy.\n\nBefore every meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)—the forum in which we make monetary policy decisions at the Fed—I survey some 25 to 30 business leaders, large and small, from a group of 50 or so that I have developed over the years to provide me a sense of what is being seen from the economy’s operational side in most every sector. I have reported to my colleagues at the FOMC that the prevailing sentiment among these business operators is that the politicians and officials who craft and enforce the rules are doing so in a capricious manner that makes long-term planning difficult, if not impossible. They are increasingly distressed by the lack of consistent direction coming from Washington. They are confused and dispirited by random refereeing. So they are calling time-outs and heading to the sidelines while they wait for the referees to settle on the rules of the game.\n\nIf this is so, no amount of further monetary policy accommodation can offset the retarding effect of heightened uncertainty over the fiscal and regulatory direction of the country. As long as our economic players—businesses and consumers—are beset by unmanageable uncertainty, they will refrain from making decisions that provide the stuff of economic growth. Indeed, one could posit that further monetary accommodation might make the situation worse if private-sector operators were to conclude that the Federal Reserve has become politically pliable and is prone to substituting such accommodation for fiscal discipline.\n\nLet me turn to what I hear from businesses, the players on the field.\n\nFiscal Policy Uncertainty\n\nI’ll begin with the debts and deficit figures.\n\nExcept when consumer demand is anemic, large fiscal imbalances adversely affect economic performance in at least three ways: They crowd out private-sector economic activity; they hinder policymakers’ ability to run a loose fiscal ship during recessions to allow individuals to smooth their consumption over the business cycle; and, finally, they raise the probability of a debt crisis. To be sure, when the chips are down, deficit spending is considered an orthodox practice in order to stimulate economic recovery. And the United States enjoys unique advantages that insulate it to some degree from the deleterious effect of deficits. But such insulation could and likely would be eroded over time if our fiscal imbalances swell to the extent currently predicted. By latest accounts, under the least felicitous conditions (what the Congressional Budget Office recently called an “alternative fiscal scenario”), publicly held debt bests the all-time high of 109 percent of GDP around 2025 and reaches a staggering 185 percent of GDP by 2035—more than twice the level of debt at which some economists believe significant crowding-out of private-sector economic activity occurs. This is not the baseline scenario. But the possibility of it occurring, however remote, frightens business operators, for they are uncertain not only about whether fiscal authorities will actually mitigate this risk, but also how they might go about doing so.\n\nPolicymakers, for example, have had nine full years to decide the fate of the Bush tax cuts but have yet to do so. This delay introduces uncertainty on a host of tax rates, including income taxes, estate taxes, capital gains taxes and dividends taxes. Such uncertainties have implications for business and household financial decisions.\n\nCorporate and small-business taxation is another murky area, as many of you know. And, despite recent actions taken on Capitol Hill, certainty remains evasive. Certain S corporations, for example, still fear being assessed a 15.3 percent payroll tax in the future. Investment managers do not know whether their carried interest will eventually be taxed as ordinary income. Businesses that are contemplating equipment purchases do not know whether “bonus depreciation” will be in place at the time they make these very large purchases. And the oil and gas sector does not know whether it will lose $35 billion in tax breaks when pending legislation is finalized. It is pretty hard for businesses to budget and plan for the future with these tax issues still up in the air.\n\nAnother issue, of course, is health care. Here again, there are many examples of uncertainty and its deleterious effect on economic decisionmaking. Doctors do not know whether a planned 21 percent Medicare reimbursement cut will take effect and hence do not know what kind of investments to make in their practices. Firms remain uncertain as to whether their current health plans will be grandfathered in or whether it will even make financial sense for them to provide employee health benefits once they make their way through the fine print. Medicare providers do not know whether the so-called cost curve will be bent and, if so, whether it will be done at their expense. Baby Boomers—like me—do not know how or whether they will receive promised benefits or whether those benefits will be pared back to address ever-growing unfunded liabilities. And literally hundreds of provisions in the recent health care reform law are currently being interpreted and fleshed out by government officials, with significant though unknowable financial stakes for individuals and firms alike.\n\nYou may have seen a comical snapshot of these issues in the Wall Street Journal’s “Pepper…and Salt” cartoon on July 2. In it, a mechanic lays out the various costs associated with a customer’s recent repairs as follows: “That’s $117 for parts, $75 [for] labor […] and $321 for employee health care.”[3] This, of course, would be humorous were it not so revealing: No business can cost out the provisions for health care because no business can be certain of the cost of adding employees to the payroll. As a result, high unemployment lingers, consumption—which historically has driven about 70 percent of our economy—is undermined and, thus, the economy limps along.\n\nAll of this ignores the uncertainty created by even broader fiscal debates: whether last year’s stimulus package has sufficiently boosted the economy or further stimulus is needed; whether historically large levels of government spending must remain in place or should be trimmed back. Business operators, faced with uncertainty on all these fronts, watch anxiously from the sidelines for these questions to be answered.\n\nIf firms and individuals at least know how much emphasis policymakers will place on debt reduction over the next few years, they could perhaps make informed guesses about just how “random” fiscal “refereeing” will be. But in a tumultuous economic climate accompanied by extraordinary economic and political divisions, it is perhaps unsurprising that there is no consensus on even what the general thrust of fiscal policy should be, let alone which specific provisions should be adopted.\n\nLet me close this discussion of fiscal uncertainty with one more thought. Some of you may wonder whether our elected officials, faced with the truly monumental task of balancing the nation’s books, might simply throw in the towel and turn to the Fed to print us out of this enormous fiscal hole. If such a request were ever made, there should be no uncertainty: We at the Fed cannot and will not monetize the debt. We know what happens when central banks give in to those requests—it leads us down the slippery slope of debasing our currency and puts us on the path of hyperinflation and economic destruction. Neither I nor my colleagues are willing to risk that legacy.\n\nIn this regard, let me add that the Federal Reserve is absolutely committed to its goal of achieving price stability. This entails keeping inflation extremely low and stable. Neither inflation nor deflation will be tolerated.\n\nThe United States has just emerged from a long and deep recession, caused in part by a series of deflationary shocks: a housing bust, a stock market crash and an implosion of the banking industry, to name a few of the more obvious.\n\nThe FOMC implemented a monetary policy stimulus to offset the deflationary forces it faced in 2008 and 2009. The Fed grew its balance sheet when both businesses and households were deleveraging and seeking to shrink their balance sheets. Deflation was averted, and inflation will be averted as the Fed slowly reduces the size of its balance sheet when private-sector deleveraging begins to slow and reverse. Again, price stability is the ultimate goal, and the Fed is absolutely committed to this objective.\n\nFinancial Regulatory Uncertainty\n\nThe problems posed by uncertainty are perhaps nowhere more evident than in the financial regulatory reform bill recently debated on the Hill and signed into law by President Obama last week.\n\nThe Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act offers a number of compelling examples of how regulatory uncertainty could hinder economic growth. A 2,300-page bill is bound to contain some mysteries within its passages (even after it was recently reformatted to a mere 848 pages). But given that the legislation has delegated much of the actual implementation to regulators, passage of the bill has done little to reduce the level of ambiguity in an already uncertain financial sector.\n\nIt is undoubtedly true that we live in complex times—perhaps more complex than most in recent memory. But if the scope of financial reform legislation is any measure, complexity has grown exponentially. The Banking Act of 1933—the Glass–Steagall Act—was passed in the midst of the Great Depression and represented a major overhaul of the regulatory system by establishing the FDIC, the FOMC and a separation between commercial and investment banking. Congress was able to accomplish these historic tasks in a bill that contained only a single title, 34 sections and was less than 40 pages long.\n\nLegislation to repeal Glass–Steagall, the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, was passed in 1999 with seven titles and 20 subtitles. There were a total of 141 sections, all contained in about 145 pages. Complexity marches on.\n\nFast forward to today. While the financial crisis that we just experienced was considered by many to be second in intensity only to what took place during the Great Depression, the question naturally arises: How is the business and financial community to interpret 2,300 pages, 16 titles, 38 subtitles and a total of 541 sections of legislation designed to deal with our recent travails?\n\nThere are some things we know with certainty as a result of this legislation. We will have a new Financial Stability Oversight Council to monitor systemic risk; a new resolution authority for nonbank financial companies; enhanced regulation and oversight of the derivatives markets; and a new Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.\n\nUnfortunately, it’s what we don’t know that looms especially large. Even beyond the possible unknown or hard-to-find explicit provisions contained within 2,300 pages, and even beyond the need for “technical corrections” to come, the wide array of rulemakings that are left to federal regulators fosters ever-more uncertainty. Take, for instance, Title I of the act (“Financial Stability”) and its directives to my colleagues at the Federal Reserve: There are close to 20 instances where the Fed must either promulgate rules and regulations or is authorized to do so. This does not even include those requirements where the Fed must act in conjunction with another regulatory agency.\n\nFor example:\n\nTitle I states that “The Board of Governors shall establish, by regulation, the requirements for determining if a company is predominantly engaged in financial activities …”[4]\n\nIt goes on to prescribe a vexing combination of “shall” and “may”:\n\n“The Board of Governors … shall establish prudential standards for nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding companies …” And “The Board of Governors may establish additional prudential standards for nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding companies …”[5] What we shall and what we may do await articulation.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the act’s regulatory discretion that count toward what the Wall Street Journal reported as a conservative total of 243 rulemaking requirements on the part of 11 different federal agencies.[6] As the president’s chief economic adviser Larry Summers put it recently: “This is a framework that has the potential to be as modern as the markets, but its efficacy will certainly depend upon the judgments that regulators make.”[7]\n\nThis leaves those affected by the legislation hanging on the cliff of uncertainty until we at the Fed and other regulators issue clear directives. And the uncertainty does not stop there. How will the landscape be sculpted by the new Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, and how will potential conflicts between this bureau and other financial regulatory agencies be managed? What will come of the Treasury’s study, as mandated by the act, of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac? What capital requirements and eventual exemptions in over-the-counter derivatives transactions will be established? If the FDIC is directed to “conduct its [resolution] operations in a manner that … mitigates the potential for serious adverse effects to the financial system,” how plausible is it that this resolution authority will really end “too big to fail” and associated taxpayer bailouts?[8]\n\nRegardless of how you feel about the recent reform efforts’ broad goals, I hope you see my point: This is not the best time for added uncertainty, especially when the banking industry appears to be on a very slow mend. Yet uncertainty reigns.\n\nThe bottom line is this: In whatever realm and whatever form, excessive uncertainty is the enemy of economic growth. As Ben Bernanke wrote in 1980, the “resolution of uncertainty” can lead to “[a business] investment boom.”[9] It follows, then, that if and as regulators and legislators provide more clarity, a major roadblock to economic growth will be removed.\n\nIt was recently reported that nonfarm, nonfinancial firms in the U.S. have over $1.8 trillion worth of liquid assets sitting on their books. Excess bank reserves being parked in the 12 Federal Reserve Banks exceed $1 trillion. If and as the incidence of “random refereeing” and uncertainty is assuaged, then we might well have the opportunity for robust growth in employment and capital expenditure expansion as firms and banks put that excess cash to use. That’s the good news.\n\nSo, how do we proceed from here?\n\nFirst, we at the Fed must continue to comport ourselves in a manner that exorcises any lingering worries about our willingness to brook any political interference with our commitment to fostering price stability and maximum sustainable employment. We delivered on our duty to restore liquidity to the commercial paper, asset-backed securities, interbank lending and other markets. We then closed out all of our extraordinary liquidity facilities, doing so without costing the taxpayer a dime (imagine that: a government agency that closes programs after they have outlived their usefulness!). We have worked hard to earn the respect of the marketplace and of the nation, and we dare not risk it at a time when there is so much uncertainty elsewhere.\n\nSecond, our political leaders should muster the courage to pull up their socks and strike a better balance between the long-term need to keep government debt low and the short- to medium-term need for an appropriate level of fiscal stimulus.\n\nFinally, it is important that we obtain clear and forthright government policies. Businesses can pursue their economic interests only if government honors its commitments and ensures a fair and equitable playing field. Unclear policies and undefined regulations create uncertainty and instability that bollix long-term planning. Those responsible for enforcement of recently passed reforms need to focus with laser-like intensity on addressing the regulatory indigestion that has engulfed our economy.\n\nUntil business operators are provided the clarity they need, they will continue to hoard their cash, limit their payrolls and constrain investment in new plant and equipment—none of which provides hope for the unemployed or will put us on a more forceful path to recovery.\n\nThomas Jefferson is credited with saying, “In matters of style, swim with the current; in matters of principle, stand like a rock.” We at the Fed have done all we can to stand like a rock on the principle of good monetary policy. It is now time for our fiscal agents to take a principled stand and act in the long-term interest of the nation rather than in the fashion of the moment.",

            "content": "June 3, 2010 Dallas, Texas\n\nI understand from Scott MacDonald that tonight is the 53rd annual keynote address and banquet of the SW Graduate School of Banking—an impressive anniversary, which reminds me of a story.\n\nA couple is deciding where to dine on their 10th wedding anniversary. They settle on the Ocean View Restaurant because that is where the beautiful, hard-bodied people go. On their 20th anniversary, they discuss where to celebrate, and they agree again on the Ocean View because the wines and the food are superb. For their 30th, they return to the Ocean View once more, having agreed that, as they sit there in silence, the view from the terrace is second to none. On their 40th anniversary, they agree that the Ocean View is just right because it has wheelchair access and an elevator to get them to the porch overlooking the ocean. On their 50th, they want to do something truly special to celebrate. So they decide to go to the Ocean View … because they have never been there before.\n\nMost of you are bankers—many, graduates or future graduates of this fine school. My message to you tonight is to remember where we have been. We have collectively been to hell and back. Let’s not go there again. Let’s remember that bankers should never succumb to what is trendy or fashionable or convenient but should instead focus on what is sustainable and in the interest of providing for the long-term good of their customers.\n\nYou gather tonight on the eve of a conference of key members of the House of Representatives and the Senate of the United States seeking to agree upon legislation to foster financial reform.[1] This evening, I am going to discuss this reform initiative. I do so, as always, speaking my own mind, making clear that I speak for nobody else at the Fed (something that is usually patently clear). I do so as one of only a few members of the Federal Open Market Committee who have been practicing commercial bankers. And I do so in the belief that it is always best to speak the truth to political convention.\n\nIn their unicameral sessions, the House and Senate have cleared away a lot of the underbrush of who does what to whom. As it now stands—due in significant part to the efforts of Sen. Hutchison of Texas and her colleague Sen. Klobuchar of Minnesota—my colleagues and I at the Federal Reserve will have responsibility for regulating, in some fashion, banking organizations across the spectrum, from community and regional banks to money center banks to thrift holding companies. I believe we are best suited for such responsibility. We have been battle hardened by the crises of both the 1980s here in Texas and this most recent episode, which threatened to bring the system of market capitalism to the brink. Yet, at the same time, I have some concerns about our ability to deal with the most vexing of the issues presented by the recent crisis: the issue of institutions that are considered “too big to fail” (or, if you prefer the acronym that has become commonplace, TBTF).\n\nThe Not-So-Shadow System\n\nIt has become popular to blame recent financial problems on the so-called shadow banking system. This, however, is an obfuscation. The heavily advertised distinction between commercial banks and the shadow banking system is, in many ways, false.\n\nTake, for example, one of the most well-known and problematic phenomena of the shadow banking world: structured investment vehicles, or SIVs. Despite repeated claims to the contrary, SIVs were not distinct from commercial banks. Many SIVs actually originated from the very core of the commercial banking system—dominated in size by the largest banks—where bank regulation was presumably the strongest. Make no mistake: Big banks created SIVs. They supported SIVs with credit and liquidity enhancements. They marketed and invested in SIVs. And once the crisis hit, big banks were forced to bring SIVs onto their balance sheets. In this way, the presumed distinction between the commercial banking system and the so-called shadow banking system is false.\n\nIt is also a widely held misperception that SIVs escaped regulatory treatment. Regulators knew about them and even applied capital requirements to them. Unfortunately, those regulatory requirements were woefully inadequate. The favorable regulatory treatment granted to many of these vehicles was, in many cases, what accounted for their existence. The vehicles were created not so much for an economic purpose, but rather to minimize regulatory capital requirements.\n\nSIVs and other programs sponsored by big banks were also exposed to runs. In contrast to other members of the shadow banking system—like hedge funds—SIVs had inadequate mechanisms in place to protect their liquidity.\n\nI do not wish to single out SIVs. They are just one example of the excess to which large institutions succumbed. We are well aware of the alphabet soup of acronyms, including CDOs and CLOs, that contributed to the crisis, along with an excessive degree of faith in the ability of complex statistical models to mathematize risk taking.\n\nDealing with TBTF\n\nOf course, recent financial problems have not been limited to large institutions and their opaque operations. As you in this room know all too well, regional and community institutions have faced their own difficulties, especially in the context of construction lending. Smaller banks that have realized debilitating losses have failed. When they got into deep trouble, regulators took them over and resolved them.\n\nWe might have expected a similar treatment of big banks. But we would have been wrong. Regulators have, for the most part, tiptoed around these larger institutions. Despite the damage they did, failing big banks were allowed to lumber on, with government support. It should come as no surprise that the industry is unfortunately evolving toward larger and larger bank size with financial resources concentrated in fewer and fewer hands.\n\nBased on these considerations, coupled with studies suggesting severe limits to economies of scale in banking, it seems that mostly as a result of public policy—and not the competitive marketplace—ever larger banks have come to dominate the financial landscape. And, absent fundamental reform, they will continue to do so. As a result of public policy, big banks have become indestructible. And as a result of public policy, the industrial organization of banking is slanted toward bigness.\n\nBig banks that took on high risks and generated unsustainable losses received a public benefit: TBTF support. As a result, more conservative banks were denied the market share that would have been theirs if mismanaged big banks had been allowed to go out of business. In essence, conservative banks faced publicly backed competition.\n\nLet me make my sentiments clear: It is my view that, by propping up deeply troubled big banks, authorities have eroded market discipline in the financial system.\n\nThe system has become slanted not only toward bigness but also high risk. Consider regulators’ efforts to impose capital requirements on big banks. Clearly, if the central bank and regulators view any losses to big bank creditors as systemically disruptive, big bank debt will effectively reign on high in the capital structure. Big banks would love leverage even more, making regulatory attempts to mandate lower leverage in boom times all the more difficult. In this manner, high risk taking by big banks has been rewarded, and conservatism at smaller institutions has been penalized. Indeed, large banks have been so bold as to claim that the complex constructs used to avoid capital requirements are just an example of the free market’s invisible hand at work. Left unmentioned is the fact that the banking market is not at all free when big banks are not free to fail.\n\nIt is not difficult to see where this dynamic leads—to more pronounced financial cycles and repeated crises.\n\nThis is the threat that legislators are now attempting to address in the financial reform bill. A widely noted feature of this legislative effort is the fairly broad scope for regulatory discretion.\n\nFor instance, under the proposed legislation, systemically important companies are required to submit a “living will.” According to the legislation, these firms are “to report periodically to the [Fed’s] Board of Governors, the [Financial Stability Oversight] Council, and the [FDIC] the plan of such company for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure.”[2]\n\nIf the Board and FDIC find the plan deficient, the bill calls for the company to resubmit an alternative approach within a set time frame. Failure to resubmit the resolution plan could result in the imposition of more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth and activities. Furthermore, the Board and FDIC, in consultation with the council, may direct the firm “to divest certain assets or operations identified by the Board of Governors and the [FDIC], to facilitate an orderly resolution.”[3]\n\nThe legislation also requires that a Credit Exposure Report be submitted “periodically” on “the nature and extent to which the company has credit exposure to other significant nonbank financial companies and significant bank holding companies; and … the nature and extent to which other significant nonbank financial companies and significant bank holding companies have credit exposure to that company.”[4]\n\nThe new Financial Stability Oversight Council is directed to “make recommendations to the [Fed’s] Board of Governors concerning the establishment of heightened prudential standards for risk-based capital, leverage, liquidity, contingent capital, resolution plans and credit exposure reports, concentration limits, enhanced public disclosures, and overall risk management” for systemically important institutions.[5]\n\nThe name of the game, here, is regulatory discretion.\n\nThere are—as there always are—criticisms. Some feel, for instance, that while regulators are being given more authority, they are also being given ambiguous, if not conflicting, directives that would leave the specter of TBTF lurking in the background. For instance, the bill states that it seeks “to provide the necessary authority to liquidate failing financial companies that pose a significant risk to the financial stability of the United States in a manner that mitigates such risk and minimizes moral hazard.”[6] It also directs the FDIC to “ensure that the shareholders of a covered financial company do not receive payment until after all other claims … are fully paid.”[7] However, the bill goes on to state that in the disposition of assets, the FDIC shall “to the greatest extent practicable, conduct its operations in a manner that … mitigates the potential for serious adverse effects to the financial system.”[8]\n\nLanguage that includes a desire to minimize moral hazard—and directs the FDIC as receiver to consider “the potential for serious adverse effects”—provides wiggle room to perpetuate TBTF.\n\nCriticisms aside, this is the path our legislative powers have laid out for dealing with the issue of TBTF. Regulators must now decide exactly how they will travel down that path.\n\nThere appear to be three major ways to navigate proposed policy making toward big banks: (1) the regulate ’em camp, (2) the resolve ’em camp and (3) the shrink ’em camp.\n\nLet’s examine these one by one.\n\nRegulate ’Em\n\nFirst, we have the “regulate ’em” camp. While it is certainly true that ineffective regulation of systemically important institutions—like big commercial banking companies—contributed to the crisis, I find it highly unlikely that such institutions can be effectively regulated, even after reform.\n\nTo be blunt: Simple regulatory changes in most cases represent a too-late attempt to catch up with the tricks of the regulated—the trickiest of whom tend to be large. In the U.S. financial system, what passed as “innovation” was in large part circumvention, as financial engineers invented ways to get around the rules of the road. There is little evidence that new regulations, involving capital and liquidity rules, could ever contain the circumvention instinct.\n\nThe history of regulatory capital requirements is not a distinguished one:[9]\n\nRegulatory reform discussions portray the need to control systemic risk as a new game in town—as if it were a new responsibility that need only be assigned. This is not the case: Bank regulators have long viewed the containment of systemic risk as a primary rationale for capital requirements. The problem is that capital regulation has rarely been truly successful.\n\nRequiring additional capital against risk sounds like a good idea but is difficult to implement. What should count as capital? How does one measure risk before an accident occurs? And how does one counteract the strong impulse of the regulated to minimize required capital in highly complex ways? History has shown these issues to be quite difficult. While we do not have many examples of effective regulation of large, complex banks operating in competitive markets, we have numerous examples of regulatory failure with large, complex banks.\n\nSo, you might say I am a skeptic of regulation alone.\n\nResolve ’Em\n\nIn my opinionated view, a traditional regulatory response—while well-intentioned—cannot, by itself, fully address the threat of TBTF. So we turn to the “resolve ’em” camp.\n\nThe argument goes something like this: If deeply troubled large banks are allowed to fail, the banking industry could evolve toward a market-driven structure. During the recent crisis, regulators lamented the lack of a formal resolution process for large and complex financial organizations, claiming it reduced their options and tied their hands. So it follows that a resolution regime whereby regulators can economically resolve failed big banks might be the ticket. In this case, there will be no more TBTF.\n\nUnfortunately, imposing creditor losses at a failing big bank, while simultaneously avoiding market disruptions, involves more than a bit of sophistry. Realistically, it would be difficult to accomplish both at the same time. Based on experience, one of these goals will take precedence over the other. And history shows which goal typically wins.\n\nThe sad truth is that when the chips are down, regulators become reluctant to put their money where their mouths are—or more precisely, they become too eager to put their money where they said they would not. Few, if any, policymakers have been willing to let large banking organizations fail, thereby missing an opportunity to impose significant losses on failed institutions’ creditors. We know from intuition and experience that any financial institution deemed TBTF will not be allowed to fail in the traditional sense. When such an institution becomes troubled, its creditors are protected in the name of market stability. The TBTF problem is exacerbated if the central bank and regulators view wiping out big bank shareholders as too disruptive, extending this measure of protection to ordinary equity holders.\n\nIn the recent crisis, authorities protected both—uninsured creditors and shareholders of big banks. While uninsured creditors received the greatest protection, regulators even partnered with existing shareholders through the injection of public funds. This program eventually spread to banks of all sizes, but its initial focus was the very largest banks. True, many large-bank shareholders sustained severe losses—but they were not zeroed out. They and their institutions have lived to see another day.\n\nWhy should we think the future could, realistically, be any different—especially with even bigger banks that dominate the financial landscape today?\n\nA credible big-bank resolution process that imposes creditor losses will be difficult to enforce, especially when regulators are explicitly directed to mitigate disruptions to the financial system, as they are in the proposed reform bill. And there remain the technical problems of resolution, such as the difficulty of quickly estimating a rate of recovery on a large and complex banking organization and paying it out to creditors. Countless issues like this remain unaddressed. For instance, how would a resolution regime market assets of a failed big bank? Major business lines presumably would be kept intact to preserve value and maximize recovery. But if one large organization were simply sold to another, the industry could become more concentrated than before. That is exactly what happened during the crisis as large failing firms were sold to other large firms.\n\nAll of this ignores a still-greater problem: Even if an effective resolution regime can be written down, chances are it might not be used. There are myriad ways for regulators to forbear. Accounting forbearance, for example, could artificially boost regulatory capital levels at troubled big banks. Special liquidity facilities could provide funding relief. In this and similar manners, crisis-related events that might trigger the need for resolution could be avoided, making resolution a moot issue. TBTF would continue, in any case.\n\nConsider the idea of limiting any and all financial support strictly to the system as a whole, thus preventing any one firm from receiving individual assistance. Many have argued such a restriction would minimize the possibility of bank bailouts. Even under this restriction, however, support for large institutions at the expense of smaller peers could live on. If authorities wanted to support a big bank in trouble, they would need only institute a systemwide program. Big banks could then avail themselves of the program, even if nobody else needed it. Systemwide programs are unfortunately a perfect back door through which to channel big bank bailouts.\n\nOr consider the so-called living wills introduced in the financial reform bill. These presumably might serve as a type of instruction manual or roadmap for resolving a large failed bank. But, quite unfortunately, large banking companies have organized themselves in ways that entail significant spillovers to other financial firms and the economy, thereby making a bailout, in many cases, the only credible choice for policymakers. Legislators have attempted to work around this pitfall, requiring changes to large banking companies whose wills are found wanting—prior to a crisis. This could, if used properly, reduce to tolerable levels the spillovers that would result from the imposition of creditor losses. Regardless, even after requested changes have been made, if these wills are still lacking, the associated firms will be TBTF.\n\nAgain, in my view, enhanced resolution regimes, by themselves, are not enough to end TBTF. Even a combination of enhanced regulation and resolution would likely be inadequate. The temptation to use regulatory discretion to avoid disruptions is just too great.\n\nShrink ’Em\n\nThis leaves us with only one way to get serious about TBTF—the “shrink ’em” camp. Banks that are TBTF are simply TB—“too big.” We must cap their size or break them up—in one way or another shrink them relative to the size of the industry.\n\nIn its latest version, the financial regulatory reform bill has left regulators (specifically, the Board of Governors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.) with the authority to impose greater restrictions on firms whose living wills are not credible. That authority, as I mentioned previously, could include “[divesting] certain assets or operations … to facilitate an orderly resolution.”[10] I would argue that regulators should freely use this broad authority to commit credibly to resolution with creditor losses by reducing big banks’ size and interconnectedness.\n\n(You can see why my stance on TBTF hardly endears me to audiences on Wall Street. I am given to quoting Winston Churchill in response. He said that “in finance, everything that is agreeable is unsound and everything that is sound is disagreeable.” It is most disagreeable to the big bank, big money lobby to countenance restrictions on size, and hence it is the perceived wisdom that this approach is disagreeable. And yet it is perhaps the most sound approach of all those proffered.)\n\nSome counter that even if all banks were made small or mid-size (or at least not TBTF), systemic threats—and thus the incentive for regulators to step in and save financial institutions—would not disappear. For instance, if a lot of small banks got into trouble simultaneously—or, as I like to say, forgot they had already been to the Ocean View Restaurant before and made the same bad bets at the same time—one might expect the central bank and regulators to protect bank creditors, extending TBTF protections once again. As the argument goes, breaking up big banks may be necessary but is possibly not sufficient—policymakers still must grapple with the possibility of many smaller banks getting into trouble at the same time, causing a “systemic” problem.\n\nI consider this argument hollow for a few reasons.\n\nFirst, even if this possibility turned out to be true, the threat of a loss from more isolated difficulties would mean creditors could reasonably expect losses in certain circumstances—a situation unlike TBTF.\n\nSecond, going by what we see today, there is considerable diversity in strategy and performance among banks that are not TBTF. Looking at commercial banks with assets under $10 billion, over 200 failed in the past few years, and as we have seen, failures in the hundreds make the news. Less appreciated, though, is the fact that while 200 banks failed, some 7,000 community banks did not. Banks that are not TBTF appear to have succumbed less to the herd-like mentality that brought their larger peers to their knees.\n\nWe saw similar diversity during the Texas banking crisis of the late 1980s. Small banks had diverse risk exposures. The most aggressive ones failed, while the more conservative did not.[11]\n\nSome have also pointed to the Great Depression as a period when many small banks got into trouble at the same time. That situation seems less relevant to the policy questions we face today. Those failures were the result of a liquidity crisis that brought down both nonviable and viable banks. Such a liquidity crisis among small banks would be unlikely today, as we now have federal deposit insurance, which protects deposits for funding. And, I might add, the Federal Reserve has demonstrated quite effectively over the past two years that we not only have the capacity to deal with liquidity disruptions but also the ability to unwind emergency liquidity facilities when they are no longer needed.\n\nThe point is this: The arguments against shrinking the largest financial institutions are found wanting. And sufficient or not, ending the existence of TBTF institutions is certainly a necessary part of any regulatory reform effort that could succeed in creating a stable financial system. It is the most sound response of all. The dangers posed by institutions deemed TBTF far exceed any purported benefits. Their existence creates incentives that will eventually undermine financial stability. If we are to neutralize the problem, we must force these institutions to reduce their size.\n\nI do not want to be naïve here. I am not suggesting that our banking system devolve into institutions like the Bailey Building and Loan Association in It’s a Wonderful Life. Large institutions have their virtues. They can offer an array of financial products and services that George Bailey could not. A globalized, interconnected marketplace needs large financial institutions. What it does not need, in my view, are a few gargantuan institutions capable of bringing down the very system they claim to serve.\n\nEurope and TBTF\n\nOf course, we are not the only ones dealing with the monstrous challenges of TBTF. Our friends across the Pond are also focused on the risks posed by institutions that have grown dangerously large (called “systemically important financial institutions,” or SIFIs). Despite Europe’s longstanding accommodation of, and preference for, large banking organizations in the universal banking model, the European Central Bank has become fairly forthright about the problem.\n\nUnfortunately, in attempting to address TBTF, the European Union is falling into the regulate ’em and resolve ’em camps, leaning toward capital regulation and enhanced resolution regimes as a way to limit systemic risk. Given Europe’s prevailing universal banking model, policymakers have so far stayed well outside the shrink ’em camp.\n\nBut even while policymakers in Europe debate ways to tackle TBTF, the risks posed by big, interconnected banks are materializing once again, as the adverse effect of rising sovereign credit risk on euro-area banks has led to renewed concerns about systemic risk.\n\nMoreover, Europe’s extensive public support of the banking sector under TBTF policy has left authorities with challenging questions about how to disengage this support fully without disrupting the nascent financial recovery. All these policy questions serve to illustrate the harsh tradeoffs and intractable complexities arising from the public–private intermingling entailed by TBTF.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor our capitalist system to work properly, it is important that successful risk taking be rewarded and equally important that unsuccessful risk taking be penalized. Legislators have done their level best over the past few months to, in effect, solidify this principle in our system.\n\nThat said, the race is far from over. Regulators now must pick up the baton and head for the finish line, using the authorities granted them in a manner that will ensure the safety and soundness of our system in the future. I would like to see us not waste this opportunity for true reform.\n\nJust this morning, the Washington Post summarized the impasse that inevitably blocks treatment of the TBTF pathology. In an article on preparation for this weekend’s Group of 20 talks on bank reform, it was noted that “some” participants “remain hesitant to lean too hard on banks they consider vital to their national economies.”[12] This hesitancy only perpetuates the problem: The longer authorities delay the process, the more engrained behemoth financial institutions become; the more engrained they become, the less extricable they are. And so the debilitating disease of TBTF spreads. What appears “vital” becomes “viral” and grows ever more threatening to financial stability and economic stability.\n\nI know the night is long, and I apologize for imposing the ponderous thoughts of a central banker upon you at this late hour. But go back to our aging couple and their fondness for the Ocean View Restaurant. In September, we will celebrate the 26th anniversary of the first announcement of the government’s TBTF policy. In September 1984, the Comptroller of the Currency testified before Congress that the government would not allow any of the nation’s 11 largest banks to fail. The Comptroller did, however, stress the need to find a way to deal with the potential failure of large institutions, and here we are today having failed to do so.[13] We can now keep kicking the can of TBTF down the road until dementia sets in and the banking system is made rotten by a refusal to acknowledge the pathology at the heart of the problem. Or we can use the occasion of the recent financial crisis to deal with it forthrightly while we are still vigorous and vital. I prefer the latter approach.",

            "content": "April 14, 2010 New York City\n\nRecent examinations of the leaders of Wall Street and big banks by the Congress and the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission bring to mind a quip reputedly made by Napoleon Bonaparte: “Never ascribe to malice that which is adequately explained by incompetence.”\n\nAs a prominent investor from Omaha once remarked, it is indeed amazing what is revealed when the financial tide goes out: Many who were presumably cloaked with unique insight and thought to be worthy of enormous fees and compensation packages were revealed as having nothing on. This is not because they were bad people but because they were unawares. They either failed to read history or believed they were exceptional and could avoid repeating it. Little did they know they were, in fact, unexceptional. They were simply swimming with the flow of history—unwittingly leading the financial system and the economy onto the shoals, only to be revealed as “incompetent” when the storm subsided, the tide withdrew and Congress and journalists and analysts began to sift through the wreckage.\n\nCharles Mackay documented much of what we have just experienced in his classic 1841 tome, Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions.[1] Washington Irving wrote of it in The Crayon Papers of 1890, describing the Mississippi Bubble of 1719.[2] If you wish to read the CliffsNotes version of these historical antecedents, find yourself a copy of John Kenneth Galbraith’s A Short History of Financial Euphoria, written in 1990, and mark these words:\n\n“The circumstances that induce the recurrent lapses into financial dementia have not changed in any truly operative fashion since the Tulipomania of [1636]. Individuals and institutions are captured by the wondrous satisfaction from accruing wealth. The associated illusion of insight is protected, in turn, by the oft-noted public impression that intelligence … marches in close step with the possession of money. Out of that belief … comes action, the bidding up of values, whether in land, securities, or … art. The upward movement confirms the commitment to personal and group wisdom. And so on to the moment of mass disillusion and the crash. This last [development] … never comes gently. It is always accompanied by a desperate and largely unsuccessful effort to get out.”[3]\n\nThe fact is that in the world of financial panics, nothing is new under the sun. Financial dementia is a recurring theme throughout history, and excessive leverage is always its causal agent. Levered asset prices always overshoot during booms and overcorrect during busts. Those hailed as financial mavens during speculative bubbles are transmogrified into hapless mortals when those bubbles pop. As financial commentator John Cassidy recently observed as the first lesson from the demise of Bear Stearns, “Leverage kills.”[4]\n\nAt some time between Mackay and Irving—and well before Galbraith—John Stuart Mill pointed out the obvious: “Panics,” he wrote, “do not destroy capital. They merely reveal the extent to which it has previously been destroyed by its betrayal into hopelessly unproductive works.”[5]\n\nThe patron saint of this assemblage, Hyman Minsky, understood the cycle of financial “revelation” documented by Mackay and Irving and Mill and countless other predecessors of Galbraith and, more recently, Michael Lewis.[6] Minsky assigned it a taxonomy: His classifications for leverage encompassed “hedge borrowers,” “speculative borrowers” and “Ponzi borrowers.”\n\nMinsky understood the progression toward the Ponzi side of the equation that ensues as the game continues and the market accommodates the “betrayal” of capital into “hopelessly unproductive works.” The Ponzi borrower works under the assumption that price appreciation will hide cash flows that cannot cover credit obligations (less erudite observers refer to this as the bigger-fool theory). Minsky warned of the denouement of this complex evolution of levered speculation: The domino effect goes into reverse, infecting even the most sound of investments and leading to a financial crisis and economic contraction.\n\nDuring the Russian financial crisis of 1998, Paul McCulley of PIMCO coined the term Minsky Moment—which he used to describe the moment of epiphany when the lightbulb goes on and the market recognizes the jig is up for Ponzi borrowers. I call it a Wodehouse Moment. For it was P. G. Wodehouse—by no means an economist and someone who wouldn’t have known a PIMCO from a Pimm’s Cup—who effectively summed it all up when he observed: “… just when a [fellow] is feeling particularly … braced with things in general … Fate sneaks up behind him with a bit of lead piping.”[7]\n\nToday, as we meet to address the theme of this conference—planning a new financial structure after the crisis—I would like to address some matters you might consider to mitigate the destruction that the lead pipe of Fate inevitably metes out in financial cycles.[8]\n\nEven as we accept that markets and market operators are given to volatility and panic, we also know from repeated experience that market failures that roil the financial system can have disastrous repercussions—setting off an adverse feedback loop of contracting credit flows, declining economic activity, and sustained, high unemployment. This reminds us of the vital role money and well-deployed credit play in maintaining a healthy economy. I liken it to the cardiovascular system. In an economy, the central bank is the heart, money is the lifeblood, and financial markets are the arteries and capillaries that provide critical sustenance to the muscles that are the makers of goods and services and the creators of employment. A properly functioning cardiovascular system fosters healthy growth; if that system fails, the body breaks down and the muscles atrophy.\n\nThat is what happened in the most recent crisis. Elaborate statistical models and complex securitization products created the illusion of control over credit and liquidity risk in the banking and credit system. They proved to be shills for Minsky’s Ponzi borrowers. Misperceptions of risk and misplaced incentives led to misguided actions. As market participants uncovered the truth and the Minsky/Wodehouse Moment came—as it always does, however late—confidence quickly gave way to fear and doubt. With uncertainty in full fever, cash was hoarded; counterparties, already complicit in financing or insuring “unproductive works,” viewed each other with suspicion; no business, productive or otherwise, appeared worthy of financing. Galbraith’s “moment of mass disillusion” struck. A full-blown seizure occurred. The economy, starved of the lifeblood of capital, shut down.\n\nBy now, I suspect many share my conviction regarding the need for improved financial regulation, including those who only a few years ago proclaimed the transcendent efficiency of financial markets—what I refer to as “the elaborate conceit of efficient market theory”—where today’s prices are always right, markets are self-correcting and regulation is best kept to a bare minimum.\n\nIn theory, the Fed’s monetary policy and regulatory functions are separate. In practice, they are anything but—rather, it is a symbiotic relationship. The past two years have highlighted the interconnections of monetary and regulatory policy: Monetary policy depends upon regulation that ensures the soundness of financial institutions.\n\nChanges in the federal funds rate and other methods employed to implement monetary policy get transmitted to the economy through the arteries of the financial sector, affecting the rate at which businesses produce and grow employment, the exchange rate of the dollar and, by extension, international trade and capital flows. The process works most efficiently when those arteries are open and healthy and strong. Sick banks cannot lend and properly act as intermediators. When they cannot lend or are otherwise hampered, monetary policy actions lose their capacity to influence the economy with accustomed efficiency.\n\nHere is the message for those who would peel away regulatory policy from the Fed: We depend on our regulatory arm to provide in-depth, hands-on assessments to guide us as we perform our duty as the lender of last resort. We can’t properly operate a discount window or perform the functions of lender of last resort if we don’t have firsthand knowledge of our borrowers’ financial health. We cannot implement monetary policy effectively without staying abreast of developments in the banking and financial system through the eyes and ears and constant contact of the 12 Banks in our System that observe up close and personal the activities of banks of all sizes—from the roughly $1.7 trillion in assets of the 844 state member banks we regulate to the roughly $16.8 trillion in assets of the nearly 5,000 bank holding companies we regulate (which include but are not exclusively large financial institutions, or LFIs).[9]\n\nDuring a crisis, you need the ability to make the proper decisions quickly. It is simply impossible to properly evaluate the health of a potentially troubled borrower with information generated by another agency. This was one of the harsh lessons learned from examining the entrails of Washington Mutual and Lehman and AIG, over whom we had no regulatory oversight at the time they went into cardiac arrest.\n\nCurrent proposals being discussed in Congress would shrink the Fed’s regulatory and supervisory responsibilities by placing all state-chartered banks under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and all nationally chartered banks and their holding companies under some new regulatory agency, leaving us either with no regulatory oversight or solely with regulatory oversight of LFIs. In my view, these proposals are misguided. In keeping with my cardiovascular theme, I have argued that removing the Fed from supervision and regulation of banks of all sizes and complexity—from community banks to the most complex LFIs—would be the equivalent of ripping out the patient’s heart, noting that it would surely prevent another heart attack but would likely have serious consequences for the patient. Our job is to keep the patient healthy and prevent another attack—something you cannot do without the ability to monitor the patient’s health. The best way to do that is to keep the Fed in banking and financial supervision.\n\nI mentioned LFIs. A truly effective restructuring of our regulatory system will have to neutralize what I consider to be the greatest threat to our financial system’s stability. You discussed this topic this morning—I refer to institutions that are considered “too big to fail.”\n\nIn the past two decades, the biggest banks have grown significantly bigger. The average size of U.S. banks relative to gross domestic product has risen threefold. The share of industry assets for the 10 largest banks climbed from almost 25 percent in 1990 to almost 60 percent in 2009.\n\nExisting rules and oversight are not up to the acute regulatory challenge imposed by the biggest banks. First, these large institutions are sprawling and complex—so vast that their own management teams may not fully understand their own risk exposures, providing fertile ground for unintended “incompetence” to take root and grow. It would be futile to expect that their regulators and creditors could untangle all the threads, especially under rapidly changing market conditions. Second, big banks may believe they can act recklessly without fear of paying the ultimate penalty. They and many of their creditors assume the Fed and other government agencies will cushion the fall and assume some of the damages, even if their troubles stem from negligence or trickery. They have only to look to recent experience to take some comfort in that assumption.\n\nSome argue that bigness is not bad, per se. Many ask how the U.S. can keep its competitive edge on the global stage if we cede LFI territory to other nations—an argument I consider hollow given the experience of the Japanese and others who came to regret seeking the distinction of having the world’s biggest financial institutions. I know this much: Big banks interact with the economy and financial markets in a multitude of ways, creating connections that transcend the limits of industry and geography. Because of their deep and wide connections to other banks and financial institutions, a few really big banks can send tidal waves of trouble through the financial system if they falter, leading to a downward spiral of bad loans and contracting credit that destroys many jobs and many businesses, creating enormous social costs. This collateral damage is all the more regrettable because it is avoidable.\n\nThese costs are rarely delineated by analysts. To get one sense of their dimension, I commend to you a thought-provoking paper recently written by Andrew Haldane, executive director for financial stability at the Bank of England.[10]\n\nHaldane pulls no punches. He considers systemic risk to be “a noxious by-product” or a “pollutant” of an overconcentrated banking industry that “risks endangering innocent bystanders within the wider economy.” He points out that the fiscal transfers made in rescuing or bailing out too-big-to-fail (TBTF) institutions—whether they are repaid at a profit or not—are insufficient metrics for costing out both the damage of their mismanagement and their subsequent rescues. Like me, he puts things in the perspective of the entire cardiovascular system and the body of the economy. He concludes: “… these direct fiscal costs are almost certainly an underestimate of the damage to the wider economy which has resulted from the crisis.”\n\nHaldane points to the shrinkage in global output compared with what output would have been in the absence of the crisis that metastasized within the TBTF institutions, arguing that “evidence from past crises suggests that crisis-induced output losses are permanent, or at least persistent, in their impact on the level of output.” He calculates that, in money terms, the persistent world economic output lost relative to what would have obtained in the absence of the recent crisis might be $60 trillion or more. That’s $60 trillion with a “T”—more than four years worth of American economic output.\n\nTo be fair, the author acknowledges that computed output losses may significantly overstate the real social costs of TBTF—that it may not be fair to take a kitchen-sink approach to the costs incurred by letting these institutions lumber on and then be rescued. Regardless, the message is clear: The existence of institutions considered TBTF exacerbated a crisis that has cost the world a substantial amount of potential output and a whole lot of employment.\n\nHaldane also looks at other social costs—among them the funding advantage associated with TBTF institutions, which has widened during the crisis and, according to one reputable study he cites, amounts to $34 billion a year for the 18 largest U.S. banks.[11]\n\nI will let you read Haldane’s study and form your own conclusions. For me, it simply adds grist to the mill of my conviction, based on my experience at the Fed, that the marginal costs of TBTF financial institutions easily dwarf their purported social and macroeconomic benefits. The risk posed by coddling TBTF banks is simply too great.\n\nTo be sure, having a clearly articulated “resolution regime” would represent a step forward, though I fear it might provide false comfort: Creditors may view favorably a special-resolution treatment for large firms, continuing the government-sponsored advantage bestowed upon them. Given the danger these institutions pose to spreading debilitating viruses throughout the financial world, my preference is for a more prophylactic approach: an international accord to break up these institutions into ones of more manageable size—more manageable for both the executives of these institutions and their regulatory supervisors.\n\nIt would obviously take some work to determine where to draw the line. Haldane’s paper suggests that “economies of scale appear to operate among banks with assets less, perhaps much less, than $100 billion,” above which “there is evidence … of diseconomies of scale.”[12] And if you subscribe to the emerging wisdom that “too big to fail” is synonymous with “too complex to manage,” you might agree with me that another term should be added to the banking lexicon—diseconomies of dysfunctionality.\n\nThe point is there are limits to size and to scope beyond which global authorities should muster the courage to draw a very bright, red line. I align myself closer to former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker in this argument and would say that if we have to do this unilaterally, we should. I know that will hardly endear me to an audience in New York, but that’s how I see it. Winston Churchill said that “in finance, everything that is agreeable is unsound and everything that is sound is disagreeable.” I think the disagreeable but sound thing to do regarding institutions that are TBTF is to dismantle them over time into institutions that can be prudently managed and regulated across borders. And this should be done before the next financial crisis, because we now know it surely cannot be done in the middle of a crisis.\n\nWhile my views on TBTF may be slightly radical (if eminently sensible), my perspective on the importance of central bank independence is, I believe, very much mainstream. So I will conclude these musings on that more pleasant subject.\n\nCentral banks must take a long-term view of the economy and craft appropriate policy responses. We must have the leeway to raise interest rates when others want cheap credit and rein in risky financial practices when others want easy profits. A Fed committed to wringing out the economy’s excesses and keeping banks on the straight and narrow is not going to win popularity contests. Some of those displeased by Fed decisions will seek to satisfy their desires by resorting to political pressure.\n\nIndependent does not mean unaccountable. We have always been subject to oversight, but since Ben Bernanke took the chair, we have ramped up our efforts to be as transparent as is prudent in the conduct of monetary policy. For example, the Fed is the only business in America that I know of that provides a public accounting of its balance sheet every week—it is called the H.4.1 release, and it is available on the Internet. We now release more fulsome economic projections and minutes of our meetings. At the twice-yearly reporting and testimony before Congress required under the Humphrey–Hawkins legislation, the chairman responds directly and distinctly to questions from members of the key oversight committees. And we have responded to those suggestions we feel further our mission. For example, in the recent Humphrey–Hawkins sessions, the chairman made clear that we are willing to go the extra mile of letting the Government Accountability Office (GAO) peek behind the curtain of the special credit and liquidity facilities we created—even unto identifying the firms that participated in them “after an appropriate delay” so as to allow those firms to conform to their own reporting obligations.\n\nI think it safe to say we have significantly improved transparency. There are limits, however. Some advocate making the monetary policy deliberations held by my colleagues and me at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) subject to GAO audits, for example. Were this to come to pass, I believe it would lead to the politicization of the FOMC process, injecting Congress at whim into monetary policy and, if so, eventually putting us on the on-ramp to a road that could lead the United States directly to the fate suffered by once-great economies that allowed monetary policy to become the handmaiden of fiscal policy.\n\nA politicized central bank is a crippled central bank. Only a Fed insulated from short-term, political impulses can focus on crafting the right mix of policies for the economy in the long term. It needs enough space to make the tough calls—most notably, when interest rates have to be pushed upward to slow the economy. Fed independence does not just matter for monetary policy. A central bank insulated from politics and the accompanying lobbying can also be a tougher regulator, insisting on strict adherence to capital and leverage requirements as well as prudent management and lending practices.\n\nWe see in the current debacle in Greece a significant example of one of the great virtues of an independent central bank. Historically, profligate fiscal leaders in that country have turned to the monetary authority to print their way out of the corner they painted themselves into, debasing their debts through inflation and currency depreciation. That is no longer possible in Europe. The burden of correcting for fiscal malfeasance now rests squarely on the shoulders of fiscal authorities. As was reported just this week, governments across the euro zone have cobbled together a potential €30 billion in aid at below-current market rates, should Greece’s debt woes compound and donor countries agree to activate the credit line. It matters not, as was intimated in yesterday’s Wall Street Journal, whether the European Central Bank played a role in crafting that package.[13] The good news and bottom line is this: The monetary authority is off-limits as an escape hatch. And that is the way it should be—be that authority European or American.\n\nI started out by noting that booms propelled by greed, and busts born of fear, are as old as time itself. This quirk of human nature will always ignite the euphoria that fuels the ups and exacerbates the downs. Nonetheless, we need a monetary policy that leans against that propensity. We need regulatory and supervisory powers that lead to policy that ensures a sound financial system given less to the “betrayal” of capital into “hopelessly unproductive works” and more toward efficiently channeling monetary policy actions to the real economy. We need to keep monetary and regulatory authority united so we can work together in the interest of the entire financial system—not just in the interests of the largest institutions and those too big to fail where there is a greater tendency for the preconditions for Minsky/Wodehouse Moments to metastasize. And we need to ensure that this authority is free from and uncompromised by political pressures, leaving fiscal authorities to fulfill their obligations to the American people—just as we at the Fed must fulfill ours.",

            "content": "March 30, 2010 Tucson, Arizona\n\nThank you, Dean [Paul] Portney. You and the CFA Society of Tucson are kind to include me in this year's roster of your distinguished speakers at the Eller College of Management. I am honored to be here.\n\nMy much older brother, Mike Fisher, lives here in Tucson, where he has taken refuge in retirement after a stellar career in the institutional investment business. He is here tonight with his wonderful wife, Karen. They picked me up at the airport, and on the way over here, we were reminiscing. When you are with family who have known you for a lifetime, it stretches the imagination to be considered \"distinguished\"—they know better. To them, you are just a little brother or an ordinary man. To illustrate the point: I once asked my wife, Nancy, if she ever, in her wildest dreams, thought her husband would go off to great universities like the University of Arizona to give \"distinguished speaker\" lectures. Her answer was a classic: \"I hate to tell you, Richard, but after 37 years of marriage, you rarely appear in my wildest dreams.\"\n\nSo much for the puffery of being a \"distinguished speaker.\"\n\nCertainly, few imagined in their wildest dreams—or the puffery of the prolonged period in which financial mavens dispensed with common sense and assumed any and all risk assessment could be turned over to math wizards—that the financial environment and the economic disposition of our great country could have turned so rotten so quickly in 2008. Few envisioned we would go through the hell we have endured in the past two years. (Though, if memory serves, Susan Bies spoke here as a governor of the Federal Reserve System on Jan. 18, 2007, and pulled no punches in voicing concern for the precarious state of mortgage financing.)\n\nYou may remember that the third quarter of 2007 marked the 25th consecutive quarter of growth in U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). Unemployment bottomed at 4.4 percent in March of that year, and the S&P 500 Index finished the day of Oct. 9, 2007, at an all-time high of 1,565. Shortly thereafter, all hell broke loose. You know the events that transpired—I will not recount them tonight. The great comedic writer P. G. Wodehouse pretty much said it all when he wrote that \"… just when a [fellow] is feeling particularly … braced with things in general … Fate sneaks up behind him with a bit of lead piping.\"[1] The markets and the public were feeling braced by an elaborate conceit that played out too far for too long—that markets are perfect and can price risk accurately; that the price of housing and other financial trees can grow to the sky; that economic history does not repeat itself. As a result, they fell victim to the lead pipe of hubris, and a good old-fashioned panic ensued.\n\nIf there is one thing I would hope you take home with you tonight, it is this: If you want to know where we are likely to go from here, you need to know where we have been. And you need to realize that we have been there before. History does indeed repeat itself. A wise investor or a smart businessperson must heed its lessons.\n\nConsider this quote, from an essay titled \"A Time of Unexampled Prosperity\" in Washington Irving's The Crayon Papers:\n\n\"Every now and then the world is visited by one of these delusive seasons, when ‘the credit system' ... expands to full luxuriance: everyone trusts everybody; a bad debt is a thing unheard of; the broad way to certain and sudden wealth lies plain and open; and men ... dash forth boldly from the facility of borrowing.\n\n\"Promissory notes, interchanged between scheming individuals, are liberally discounted at the banks.... Everyone talks in [huge amounts]; nothing is heard but gigantic operations in trade; great purchases and sales of real property, and immense sums [are] made at every transfer. All, to be sure, as yet exists in promise; but the believer in promises calculates the aggregate as solid capital....\n\n\"Speculative and dreaming ... men ... relate their dreams and projects to the ignorant and credulous, dazzle them with golden visions, and set them maddening after shadows. The example of one stimulates another; speculation rises on speculation; bubble rises on bubble....\n\n\"Speculation ... casts contempt upon all its sober realities. It renders the [financier] a magician, and the [stock] exchange a region of enchantment.... No ‘operation' is thought worthy of attention that does not double or treble the investment. No business is worth following that does not promise an immediate fortune....\n\n\"Could this delusion always last, life ... would indeed be a golden dream; but [the delusion] is as short as it is brilliant.\"[2]\n\nIrving was writing about the Mississippi Bubble fiasco of 1719! So, yes, just as Wodehouse said: Fate has a nasty habit of repeatedly sneaking up behind contented financial markets with a bit of lead piping.\n\nFor a more fulsome perspective on the pathology of economies' tendency to slip periodically into financial dementia, I usually instruct my academic audiences to go back and read the classic book on financial folly written in 1841 by Charles Mackay, entitled Memoirs of Extraordinary Delusions. Historians among you may remember his seminal conclusion after studying history's financial panics up to that date. \"Men,\" Mackay noted, \"think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds\"—an insight obviously overlooked by whoever wrote the copy at Merrill Lynch's ad agency more than a century later.\n\nFor many of today's students, Mackay can make for turgid reading—besides, it consumes too much memory in a Kindle and is likely not so pretty on an iPad. So tonight I am going to refer you to a short, very readable book written by one of my old college professors, the late John Kenneth Galbraith, entitled A Short History of Financial Euphoria. It is a superb treatise on the dangers of debt and the poisonous attributes of leverage—what Washington Irving referred to as \"the facility of borrowing\" in the excerpt I just quoted. Galbraith walks the reader through the ins and outs of various episodes of financial panic, beginning with the Dutch tulip craze of the mid-17th century. In his final chapter, he surmises: \"The circumstances that induce the recurrent lapses into financial dementia have not changed in any truly operative fashion since the Tulipomania of 1636–1637. Individuals and institutions are captured by the wondrous satisfaction from accruing wealth. The associated illusion of insight is protected, in turn, by the oft-noted public impression that intelligence … marches in close step with the possession of money. Out of that belief … comes action—the bidding up of values, whether in land, securities, or … art. The upward movement confirms the commitment to personal and group wisdom. And so on to the moment of mass disillusion and the crash. This last [development] … never comes gently. It is always accompanied by a desperate and largely unsuccessful effort to get out.\"[3]\n\nThe fact is that in the world of financial panics, nothing is new under the sun. Leverage is always at the root of financial debacles. Asset prices always overshoot during booms and bubbles; they always overcorrect during busts when people desperately and unsuccessfully run for the exits. The thundering herd inevitably gets spooked. The financial mania bumper sticker might read: \"Panic happens.\"\n\nYet, even if we accept that markets—be they those for bonds or derivatives, stocks or tulips or anything and everything tradable—are given to volatility and panic, we know from repeated experience that market failures that roil the financial system can have disastrous repercussions, setting off an adverse feedback loop of contracting credit flows, declining economic activity and sustained, high unemployment. We at the Federal Reserve would be remiss if we did not use our powers to counter this phenomenon.\n\nThe powers we possess are limited to affecting the vital role that money and credit play in our economy. Congress alone has the power to tax and spend your money. The Federal Reserve's influence is limited to the monetary realm. I liken it to the cardiovascular system. In an economy, the central bank is the heart, money and credit are the lifeblood, and financial markets are the arteries and capillaries that channel that lifeblood, providing critical sustenance to the muscles—the makers of goods and services and the creators of employment. A properly functioning cardiovascular system fosters healthy growth; if that system fails, the body breaks down.\n\nAs the body began to break down in 2007 and 2008, the Federal Reserve undertook several major efforts to provide well-secured, mostly short-term credit to a dysfunctional financial system. These efforts were designed to make sure that the arterial system of financial institutions—depository institutions, primary dealers, money market mutual funds, commercial paper issuers and others—would have access to adequate liquidity in a time of acute distress.\n\nTo be sure, our actions were most unusual and raised many an eyebrow. But they were not without precedent. Had you gone to the history books, you could have foretold many of the steps we took. The basic playbook for how a central bank, as the lender of last resort, deals with a financial crisis was written in the 19th century by two men: Henry Thornton and Walter Bagehot.\n\nBagehot's prescription to counter a panic bears repeating. Confronted with a panic: \"The holders of the cash reserve must be ready not only to keep it for their own liabilities, but to advance it most freely for the liabilities of others. They must lend to merchants, to minor bankers, to ‘this man and that man' whenever the security is good.\"\n\nBagehot describes the response of the Bank of England to the Panic of 1825 by quoting a former official as follows: \"We lent it … by every possible means and in modes we had never adopted before; we took in stock on security, we purchased Exchequer bills, we made advances on [those] bills, we not only discounted outright, but we made advances on the deposit of bills of exchange to an immense amount, in short, by every possible means consistent with the safety of the Bank....\"[4]\n\nAll the while bearing in mind the advice rendered by Thornton, writing in 1802: \"It is by no means intended to imply, that it would become the [Central] Bank to relieve every distress which the rashness of [bankers and financiers] may bring upon them.... The relief should neither be so ... liberal as to exempt those who misconduct their business ... nor so scanty and slow as deeply to involve the general interests. These interests, nevertheless, are sure to be pleaded by every distressed person whose affairs are large, however indifferent or even ruinous may be their state.\"[5]\n\nIf you are looking for a cognitive road map of what the Fed was up to in 2008 and 2009 as we navigated between the need to \"advance most freely for the liabilities of others, lend to bankers and merchants, and ‘to this man and that man' whenever the security is good\" and the equally compelling need to fend off the moral hazard of relieving \"those who misconduct their business,\"you might dust off your Bagehot and Thornton.\n\nTo come back to the present, I would like to remind you that as liquidity has improved and as the cardiovascular system of the financial body has been restored, we have phased out our diverse emergency lending programs. After tomorrow, on April 1, the sole remaining segment of this plethora of emergency liquidity initiatives will be the term asset-backed securities loan facility (TALF) for newly issued, commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), and that will be closed on June 30.\n\nWe kept our word. We said these would be short-term and extraordinary facilities designed solely to get the patient out of the ER and back on its feet. As the markets for interbank lending, commercial paper, asset-backed securities and bonds and other forms of credit repaired, we wound down our intervention. Total credit outstanding under all of our liquidity programs, including our regular discount window, peaked around $1.5 trillion at year-end 2008. At last count, total credit outstanding was down around $68 billion. (You may track this yourself by going to the Internet and pulling up what is known as our H.4.1 release. We are the only business or government agency I am aware of in the world that reports its balance sheet to the public on a weekly basis.[6]) Imagine that—a government agency actually did what it said it would do and then undid it. And we did so without costing the taxpayer a single penny.\n\nThat said, in parallel to our expansion and unwinding of the various liquidity facilities we created, we have purchased substantial assets—$300 billion in Treasuries, $175 billion in agency debt and $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities (MBS). These asset purchases have left the banking system with a great deal of liquidity: U.S. banks now hold more than $1.1 trillion of reserves on the liability side of the balance sheets of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks. Combined, the asset purchases we have undertaken and the buildup in reserves that have resulted from those purchases have improved conditions in the mortgage and other credit markets, putting downward pressure on borrowing rates and spreads. But they have left us with a bloated balance sheet, which we desire to slim down as conditions warrant.\n\nThe disposition of those assets and liabilities will depend on the course of the economy.\n\nPresently, the economy is afflicted by excess capacity, including high unemployment, and a notable absence of price pressures. I stuck my neck out and declared last August that an economic recovery had begun.[7] This was later confirmed by positive GDP growth in the third quarter and explosive, 5.6 percent growth in the fourth quarter. Much of that burst of growth from the depths of recession was led by inventory adjustments. Now businesses are settling into the basic ground game of advancing one yard at a time—the goal being to grow their top lines and expand their underlying businesses. Generally, the data indicate that we will move down the field this year at about a 3 percent clip. It is less than we had grown accustomed to in the heyday before the crisis, and it may not result in as rapid a reduction in unemployment as we would like. But it is positive and noteworthy.\n\nThose that transport goods by ships are reporting a better balance between supply and demand. Air freight has seen a sustained pickup in traffic these past three months. Volumes shipped year-to-date by rail are up on the order of 3.5 percent. Trucking activity has turned up. There has been a pickup in getting goods to market. Semiconductor manufacturers are adding capacity to meet underlying demand that is, as one company describes, \"beyond normal seasonal demands.\" Real spending on equipment and software is increasing. Telephone companies report that long-distance minutes and roaming activity are on the rise, indicating improvement particularly among business users. Advertising on television and on the Internet is trending upward, indicating greater confidence in the market for goods and services. And if you closely examine retail activity, you will notice that stores and chains that service all but the bottom quartile of shoppers report that consumers, while still value-driven, are beginning to add an item or two to what they take to the check-out counter. This was confirmed by the data on personal spending released yesterday.\n\nTaken together, anecdotal evidence indicates that, absent some exogenous shock, the recovery that began last summer is unlikely to be reversed and will instead proceed, slowly gathering momentum as we progress through the year. The good news is that we are beginning to see some rays of sunshine emerge from the leftover clouds of the frightful storm we have just experienced.\n\nTo be sure, the skies are far from clear. There remain far too many workers on the unemployment rolls, and there are questions as to the rate at which businesses will rehire workers once their top lines begin to grow again. The housing situation remains precarious and can best be described as \"bouncing along the bottom.\" Large businesses that have access to credit and equity markets are, like banks, awash in liquidity, but small businesses still face recalcitrant bankers.\n\nTo me, some of the most worrisome clouds are being seeded by uncertainty created by government. This is occurring on two fronts—first, on the regulatory side and second, on the fiscal front.\n\nI need not tell an audience at one of the nation's most prominent public business schools about the perils of uncertainty. A good business school teaches its students to manage under conditions of uncertainty, for nothing is ever certain in the world of commerce or finance. But this task has become more challenging as the administration and Congress have sought major changes in the regulatory framework governing health care and emissions standards and money and banking and other areas—and in the taxes and fees they will impose to implement them. Until all of these changes are agreed to and announced, businesses will be unable to cost them out and discern how their franchises will be impacted. So long as they face this uncertainty, businesses will be inhibited from hiring significant amounts of workers or committing substantial dollars to investment in plant and equipment and technology.\n\nOn the fiscal front, the most vexing issue relates to deficits being run by Congress. I know this is a hot topic in Arizona. Here is a little tongue-in-cheek vignette sent to me by an angry citizen who likened it to Congress' appropriation of the people's monies.[8]\n\nThis would all be funny if it were not so serious. Even under the most optimistic of scenarios, large deficits will be run for as far as the eye can see. This means there will be substantial growth in federal debt. In fiscal year 2009, the Treasury went to market for almost $1.4 trillion in net new borrowing. This year, the number is expected to be about the same, maybe a little higher. A former colleague of mine—who, in the spirit of Washington Irving, Charles Mackay and John Galbraith, warned of the risk of \"irrational exuberance,\" but to no avail—recently noted the pressure this is putting on interest rates at the longer end of the yield curve, calling this \"the canary in the coal mine.\"[9] The Federal Reserve has anchored the short end of the curve at near zero. But the markets, fearing the consequences of runaway deficit financing, have bid up longer-term nominal rates, resulting in a yield curve that is now historically steep. Some of this may, of course, reflect an improvement in economic growth—but we cannot turn a blind eye to the effect that growing government indebtedness has on investors' confidence and Treasury yields.\n\nYou might well ask the \"what if\" question regarding Treasury borrowings. \"What if the insatiable borrowing of the Treasury leads to upward pressure on rates? Would the Fed then step in and buy a bundle of Treasuries just to hold rates down?\" I think not. For, should we do so, we would only become an accomplice to the fiscal incontinence of Congress. We would be perceived as \"monetizing the debt,\" a trap that inevitably leads to hyperinflation and economic destruction. We would lose all the hard-earned credibility we have gained by our conduct in the crisis if we came to be viewed by markets as a handmaiden of spendthrift political forces. That would be a bit of lead piping we could ill afford.\n\nEarlier this week, I prepared for this lecture by speaking to some of your undergraduate students by phone. One of the most memorable of them described the Fed's balance sheet as being \"really pimped out!\" I would not have chosen those words, but, yes, our balance sheet is presently gussied up. We aim to get back to the basics of holding mostly plain vanilla Treasuries—in size needed solely for conducting prudent monetary policy—on the asset side of our balance sheet. And we wish to have banks put their reserves to work, financing growth of the businesses of America, rather than piling those reserves up on the liability side of our balance sheet.\n\nOf course, we must be wary that the assets we hold are not sold into the financial system in a disruptive way and that the excess reserves held by banks on our balance sheet are not released into the system so rapidly as to create inflationary pressures. Thus we are hard at work developing a tool kit to affect an exit strategy that will not prove disruptive to either the markets or the goal of preserving price stability.[10] Achieving these goals requires that the Fed be intimately familiar with the inner workings and linkages of financial markets and institutions—a familiarity, I might add, we would lack without the insights we acquire as a bank supervisor and regulator. As we progress through this recovery period, we will continue to put those insights to use, developing and executing monetary policy in such a way that accomplishes our long-term objectives without sacrificing financial stability. And I expect the next time I visit your campus, that student's description of the Fed's balance sheet will (hopefully) be a trifle different.\n\nIf you look to history as your guide for the Federal Reserve's next move, you will note that central bankers are the least fashionable of species. Thomas Jefferson once said, \"In matters of style, swim with the current; in matters of principle, stand like a rock.\" Central bankers earn their credibility by standing like a rock on the principle of good monetary policy. We have done what we felt was consistent with our duty to pull the economy back from the brink. We are now focused on restoring our balance sheet to a more normal configuration. Now, it is up to the fiscal authorities to configure their policy so that the businesses of America might once again thrive, and prosperity will blossom.",

            "content": "March 3, 2010 New York City\n\nI paid my way through college in part by working for Irving Pratt, who grew up right here in the Harold Pratt House, long before it became the headquarters of the Council on Foreign Relations and the bête noir of conspiracy theorists. He brought me here on a summer day in 1970 to show me his boyhood home and told me that if “you apply your talents you might someday have a house just like this.” As if! Then, in the next breath he warned me of the perils of pursuing the kind of wealth he inherited, closing with William Gladstone’s famous dictum: “Not even love has made so many fools of men as the pondering over the nature of money.” Mr. Pratt’s wisdom was somehow lost on me, for here I am 40 years later, making my living pondering over the nature of money as a central banker. [1]\n\nIt would all have been a fool’s errand if I hadn’t come away from my decades of experience as a market operator and my last five years as a monetary policy maker with some lessons learned—especially against the background of the past two and a half years of crisis management. So I thought I would quickly share with you this morning some of those lessons learned, or at least a set of convictions acquired, before we have our dialogue about globalization and the contours of the recovery.\n\nI come away from my career of contemplating the nature of money with four fundamental beliefs. I am more convinced than ever that financial markets require a healthy dose of regulation to function efficiently. I am more convinced than ever of the importance of regulatory and supervisory authority to the proper conduct of monetary policy. I am more convinced than ever that too-big-to-fail banks are dangerous and should be contained, if not broken up. And I am more convinced than ever that central banks operate most effectively when insulated from political passions.\n\nReality Bites\n\nI'm a fierce advocate of free markets. I believe in the magic of the Invisible Hand. This is not to say that the Hand is always steady or isn’t given to loss of control or spastic bouts. Capitalism wasn’t designed to be stable. Asset prices overshoot during booms and bubbles; they overcorrect during busts. Panic happens. Nearly 170 years ago, Charles Mackay noted in his Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions that “Men … think in herds … [and] they go mad in herds” [2]—an insight overlooked by whoever wrote the copy at Merrill Lynch’s ad agency. Writing in the fifth and last edition of his book Manias, Panics, and Crashes, Charlie Kindleberger noted that the madness of the herd has intensified in modern times:\n\n“… the conclusion is unmistakable that financial failure has been more extensive and pervasive in the last thirty years than in any previous period.” [3]\n\nHe attributed this in part to the fact “‘that there are many more countries in the international financial economy and in part [because] data collection is more comprehensive.” [4] Mind you, this was written before the herd turned decidedly lemming-like in the lead-up to 2008.\n\nEven if we accept that markets will always be given to volatility, we know from repeated experience that market failures that roil the financial system can have disastrous repercussions—setting off an adverse feedback loop of contracting credit flows, declining economic activity and sustained, high unemployment. This reminds us of the vital role money and credit play in maintaining a healthy economy. I liken it to the cardiovascular system. In an economy, the central bank is the heart, money is the lifeblood, and financial markets are the arteries and capillaries that provide critical sustenance to the muscles that are the makers of goods and services and the creators of employment. A properly functioning cardiovascular system fosters healthy growth; if that system fails, the body breaks down and the muscles atrophy.\n\nThat is what happened in the most recent crisis. Elaborate statistical models and complex securitization products created the illusion of control over credit and liquidity risk in the banking system. Misperceptions of risk and misplaced incentives led to misguided actions. As market participants uncovered the truth—as they always eventually do, however late—confidence quickly gave way to fear and doubt. With uncertainty in full fever, cash was hoarded; counterparties viewed each other with suspicion; no business appeared worthy of financing. A full-blown seizure occurred. The economy, starved of the lifeblood of capital, shut down.\n\nBy now, I suspect many share my conviction regarding the need for improved financial regulation. We are even hearing a different tune from those who only a few years ago proclaimed the transcendent efficiency of financial markets—what I refer to as “the elaborate conceit of efficient market theory”—where today’s prices are always right, markets are self-correcting and regulation is best kept to a bare minimum.\n\nThe Fed Needs to Regulate Banks of All Sizes\n\nIn theory, the Fed’s monetary policy and regulatory functions are separate. In practice, they are anything but—rather, it is a symbiotic relationship. The past two years have highlighted the interconnections of monetary and regulatory policy: Monetary policy depends upon regulation that ensures the soundness of financial institutions.\n\nChanges in the fed funds rate and other methods employed to implement monetary policy get transmitted to the economy through the arteries of the financial sector, affecting the rate at which businesses produce and grow employment, the exchange rate of the dollar and, by extension, international trade and capital flows. The process works most efficiently when those arteries are open and healthy and strong. Sclerotic banks cannot lend and properly act as intermediators. When they cannot lend or are otherwise hampered, monetary policy actions lose their capacity to influence the economy with accustomed efficiency.\n\nHere is the message for those who would peel away regulatory policy from the Fed: We depend on our regulatory arm to provide in-depth, hands-on assessments to guide us as we perform our duty as the lender of last resort. We can’t properly operate a discount window or perform the functions of lender of last resort if we don’t have firsthand knowledge of our borrowers’ financial health. We cannot implement monetary policy effectively without staying abreast of developments in the banking and financial system through the eyes and ears and constant contact of the 12 banks in our system who observe up close and personal the activities of banks of all sizes—from the roughly $1.7 trillion in assets we observe in the 843 state member banks we regulate to the roughly $16.8 trillion in assets of the 5,002 bank holding companies, including but not exclusively large financial institutions, or “LFIs,” which we regulate.[5]\n\nDuring a crisis, you need the ability to make the proper decisions quickly. It is simply impossible to properly evaluate the health of a potentially troubled borrower with information generated by another agency. This was one of the harsh lessons learned from examining the entrails of Lehman and AIG, over whom we had no regulatory oversight at the time they went into cardiac arrest.\n\nIn my view, proposals being discussed in Congress to shrink the Fed’s regulatory and supervisory responsibilities by placing all state-chartered banks under, say, the FDIC or all nationally chartered banks and their holding companies under some new regulatory agency, leaving us either with no regulatory oversight or solely with regulatory oversight of LFIs, are misguided. To keep with my cardiovascular theme, I would argue that removing the Fed from supervision and regulation of banks of all sizes and complexity—from community banks to the most complex LFIs—would be the equivalent of ripping out the patient’s heart. That would surely prevent another heart attack but would likely have serious consequences for the patient. Our job is to keep the patient healthy—to prevent another attack. The best way to do that is to keep the Fed in supervision.\n\nToo-Dangerous-To-Permit\n\nI mentioned LFIs. A truly effective restructuring of our regulatory regime will have to neutralize what I consider to be the greatest threat to our financial system’s stability—the so-called too-big-to-fail, or TBTF, banks. In the past two decades, the biggest banks have grown significantly bigger. In 1990, the 10 largest U.S. banks had almost 25 percent of the industry’s assets. Their share grew to 44 percent in 2000 and almost 60 percent in 2009.\n\nThe existing rules and oversight are not up to the acute regulatory challenge imposed by the biggest banks. First, they are sprawling and complex—so vast that their own management teams may not fully understand their own risk exposures. If that is so, it would be futile to expect that their regulators and creditors could untangle all the threads, especially under rapidly changing market conditions. Second, big banks may believe they can act recklessly without fear of paying the ultimate penalty. They and many of their creditors assume the Fed and other government agencies will cushion the fall and assume the damages, even if their troubles stem from negligence or trickery. They have only to look to recent experience to confirm that assumption.\n\nSome argue that bigness is not bad, per se. Many ask how the U.S. can keep its competitive edge on the global stage if we cede LFI territory to other nations—an argument I consider hollow given the experience of the Japanese and others who came to regret seeking the distinction of having the world’s biggest financial institutions. I know this much: Big banks interact with the economy and financial markets in a multitude of ways, creating connections that transcend the limits of industry and geography. Because of their deep and wide connections to other banks and financial institutions, a few really big banks can send tidal waves of troubles through the financial system if they falter, leading to a downward spiral of bad loans and contracting credit that destroys many jobs and many businesses.\n\nThe dangers posed by TBTF banks are too great. To be sure, having a clearly articulated “resolution regime” would represent steps forward, though I fear they might provide false comfort in that a special resolution treatment for large firms might be viewed favorably by creditors, continuing the government-sponsored advantage bestowed upon them. Given the danger these institutions pose to spreading debilitating viruses throughout the financial world, my preference is for a more prophylactic approach: an international accord to break up these institutions into ones of more manageable size—more manageable for both the executives of these institutions and their regulatory supervisors. I align myself closer to Paul Volcker in this argument and would say that if we have to do this unilaterally, we should. I know that will hardly endear me to an audience in New York, but that’s how I see it. Winston Churchill said that “in finance, everything that is agreeable is unsound and everything that is sound is disagreeable.” I think the disagreeable but sound thing to do regarding institutions that are TBTF is to dismantle them over time into institutions that can be prudently managed and regulated across borders. And this should be done before the next financial crisis, because it surely cannot be done in the middle of a crisis.\n\nIndependence\n\nWhile my views on TBTF may be slightly radical, my perspective on the importance of central bank independence is, I believe, very much mainstream.\n\nCentral banks must take a long-term view of the economy and craft appropriate policy responses. We must have the leeway to raise interest rates when others want cheap credit and rein in risky financial practices when others want easy profits. A Fed committed to wringing out the economy’s excesses and keeping banks on the straight and narrow is not going to win popularity contests. Some of those displeased by Fed decisions will seek to satisfy their desires by resorting to political pressure.\n\nIndependent does not mean unaccountable. We have always been subject to oversight, but since Ben Bernanke took the chair, we have ramped up our efforts to be as transparent as is prudent in the conduct of monetary policy. For example, the Fed is the only business in America that I know of that provides a public accounting of its balance sheet every week—it is called the H.4.1 release, and it is available on the Internet on a weekly basis. We now release more fulsome economic projections and minutes of our meetings. At the twice-yearly reporting and testimony before Congress required under the Humphrey–Hawkins legislation, the Chairman responds directly and distinctly to questions from members of the key oversight committees. And we have responded to those suggestions we feel further our mission. For example, in the recent Humphrey–Hawkins sessions, the Chairman made clear that we are willing to go the extra mile of letting the GAO peek behind the curtain of the special credit and liquidity facilities we created—even unto identifying the firms that participated in them “after an appropriate delay” so as to allow those firms to conform to their own reporting obligations.\n\nI believe we have significantly improved transparency. There are limits, however. Some advocate making the monetary policy deliberations held by my colleagues and me at the FOMC subject to GAO audits, for example. Were this to come to pass, I believe it would lead to the politicization of the FOMC process, injecting Congress at whim into monetary policy and, if so, eventually putting us on the on-ramp to a road that could lead the United States directly to the fate suffered by once-great economies like pre-Weimar Germany, Argentina and others that allowed monetary policy to become the handmaiden of fiscal policy.\n\nA politicized central bank is a crippled central bank. Only a Fed insulated from short-term, political impulses can focus on crafting the right mix of policies for the economy in the long term. It needs enough space to make the tough calls—most notably, when interest rates have to be pushed upward to slow the economy in flush times. Fed independence does not just matter for monetary policy. A central bank insulated from politics and the accompanying lobbying can also be a tougher regulator, insisting on strict adherence to capital and leverage requirements, as well as prudent management and lending practices.\n\nWe see in the current debacle in Greece a significant example of one of the great virtues of an independent central bank. Historically, profligate fiscal authorities in that country have turned to the monetary authority to print their way out of the corner they painted themselves into, debasing their debts through inflation and currency depreciation. That is no longer possible in Europe. The burden of correcting for fiscal malfeasance now rests squarely on the shoulders of those authorities who are responsible for it. And that is the way it should be—be those authorities Greek or Irish or even American.\n\nI started out by noting that booms propelled by greed and busts born of fear are as old as time itself. This quirk of human nature will always ignite the euphoria that fuels the ups and exacerbates the downs. Nonetheless, we need a monetary policy that leans against that propensity. We need regulatory and supervisory powers that lead to policy that ensures a sound financial system, capable of most efficiently channeling monetary policy actions to the real economy. We need to keep monetary and regulatory authority united so we can work together in the interest of the entire financial system—not just the interests of the largest institutions and those too big to fail. And we need to ensure that this authority is free from short-term political pressures.\n\nMrs. Spero, that is my sermon for today. I’ve had to race through it. During the Q&A, I would be happy to harangue you further on supervision and regulation matters, or we can talk the economic outlook as seen from the Elysian Fields of Texas, the impact of globalization, or whatever suits your fancy.",

            "content": "February 10, 2010 Dallas, Texas\n\nWhen I was told I would be introduced today by George Jones, I did not realize it would be my friend and fellow Dallas-ite George Jones.\n\nOnly days after the last presidential election, I attended a dinner with the entire cast of characters from that great drama. It was an evening dedicated to repairing wounds with the greatest salve there is: humor. One of the richest moments of the night was when President Obama looked down the table and said, \"I am especially honored that Governor Palin is here. And I want to tell you, Governor, I thought you were great in '30 Rock.'\" George, I thought you were great when you were married to Tammy Wynette and when you sang \"We're Gonna Hold On.\" I still think you are great in your current incarnation as one of the leading bankers in Dallas, good husband to Miriam and a father of those beautiful children. Thank you for that introduction.\n\nThis is a Federal Reserve note—a one dollar bill. Look closely at its face. You will see that in the middle of the left side is the letter \"K,\" surrounded by two concentric circles. The outer circle says \"Federal Reserve\" and \"Texas.\" The inner circle says \"Bank of\" and \"Dallas.\" \"K\" is the 11th letter in the alphabet—in all four corners of the face of this dollar are printed the number \"11.\" The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas is responsible for the administration of the Federal Reserve's operations in the 11th of 12 Federal Reserve districts set up by Congress under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. Every one dollar bill bears the imprint of one of the Federal Reserve Banks, starting with the \"A\" of Boston and ending with the \"L\" of San Francisco. (Of course, everyone in this room knows that Dallas Fed dollars are of greater nominal value than all the others!)\n\nAs President and CEO of the Dallas Fed, I have a duty that I share with my fellow Federal Reserve Bank presidents in addition to Ben Bernanke and the four others who serve with him on the Fed's Board of Governors. Together, the 17 of us compose the Federal Open Market committee—the FOMC—where we collectively determine monetary policy. Our duty is to defend this dollar from the ravages of inflation and deflation and to conduct the monetary policy of the United States so as to encourage sustainable economic growth without sacrificing price stability.\n\nToday, I want to talk to you about what I view as the biggest threats to carrying out that duty.\n\nWe have just come through a hellish economic downturn. We are slowly clawing our way back from the edge of what could have been a repeat of the Great Depression. I trust that history will show that the Fed acquitted itself well during this period of strife and tribulation, doing its part on the monetary front to bring us back from the brink. As the lender and liquidity-provider of last resort, we provided the means for crucial credit markets—from the interbank lending markets to money market mutual funds, asset-backed securities and commercial paper—to stay open when they suffered the financial equivalent of cardiac arrest. As was made clear in the press release after our last FOMC meeting, we have removed, or are in the process of removing on a date certain, these emergency room lifelines as the patient has stabilized. Total credit extended under all of these programs, including our regular discount window lending facility, has fallen sharply from a peak of $1.5 trillion around year-end 2008 to $110 billion last week. We performed this function of restoring these vital, short-term credit markets, I might add, at no cost to the taxpayer.\n\nWe still have an abnormally expanded balance sheet stemming from our efforts to stabilize long-term credit markets. The largest component of our holdings is the trillion-and-a-quarter dollars worth of mortgage-backed securities we will have accumulated in a purchase program that will conclude at the end of March. These purchases, combined with our purchases of long-term Treasuries and some agency debt securities, have had the effect of leaving the banking system in a flush condition, with more than $1.1 trillion of reserves now held by them in the Federal Reserve Banks. The good news is that our purchases and the associated buildup of bank reserves have led to a resumption of private credit flows and a reduction in private sector borrowing costs. But we still have work to do: As the need for monetary accommodation lessens, my colleagues and I on the FOMC must find ways to unwind the Fed's much-expanded balance sheet with the deftness to minimize credit market disruptions and the timeliness to avoid inflationary pressures. We are constantly discussing internally the ways and means to shrink our balance sheet back to historical norms, aiming to have our holdings once again consisting primarily of Treasuries needed for the regular operations we undertake as the nation's central bank. Chairman Bernanke gave a pretty thorough brief on the various tools at our disposal in the public testimony he released this morning, so I will not dwell further on this point. For those of you who are interested, we can discuss this more fully in the Q&A session following these comments.\n\nAs to the economy, there remain many roadblocks that must be overcome before we will be able to breathe easy again. Businesses must develop sufficient confidence in the future to begin expanding their order books and their payrolls. Banks must be willing and able to lend again. Consumers must regain their wherewithal and the confidence to open their pocketbooks.\n\nTo be sure, we are seeing some signs of improvement on all these fronts, however hesitant they might be in the incipient stages of a \"recovery.\"\n\nBut there remain two significant obstacles threatening the ability of consumers and businesses to cast off their hesitancy. The first is widespread concern about our nation's fiscal predicament. The second is the risk that Congress will seek to politicize the Federal Reserve.\n\nOver the holidays, I read a remarkable compendium of all that Winston Churchill ever said, edited by Richard Langworth and simply titled Churchill by Himself. And this past weekend, before turning on the Super Bowl to watch our New Orleans neighbors overcome the odds and trounce the Colts, I re-read some of W. H. Auden's works, including his essay \"The Dyer's Hand,\" written in 1962. I will draw upon both here.\n\nLangworth cites a speech given by Churchill at London's Waldorf Hotel in 1926 in which he noted that \"in finance, everything that is agreeable is unsound and everything that is sound is disagreeable.\"[1]\n\nWhile it appears urgent, if not agreeable, to use massive public spending to stimulate an economy under duress, an economy cannot sustain long-term growth under the weight of significant fiscal burdens. At some point, what is considered a temporary economic prosthesis becomes a hindrance to the workings of the private sector.\n\nOver the past decade—under Congresses and administrations led by both parties—discretionary spending has grown at an average real annual rate of 5 percent, outpacing the 2.6 percent annual growth rate of the overall economy during that period. And discretionary spending for fiscal 2010, excluding defense and stimulus-related items, is currently forecast to grow by 8.2 percent nominally. Add to this the rapid decline in federal tax revenue during the 2007–09 period and a flat revenue forecast for 2010, and you've got quite a fiscal pickle.\n\nWhen tax receipts fall while discretionary spending soars, deficits are an expected consequence. A shortfall of nearly half a trillion dollars in fiscal 2008 was quickly supplanted in the history books by a $1.4 trillion shortfall last year—and will in turn be supplanted by a recently announced, projected $1.6 trillion shortfall in 2010. This means 40 cents of every dollar spent by the federal government during 2009 was deficit-financed, and that picture will not change much this year. If that does not rattle your bones, consider that income taxes brought in just over $1 trillion during 2009 and are expected to bring in a similar amount this year. If we wanted to raise enough revenue today to close the 2010 gap, we would have to more than double current income and corporate tax rates.\n\nBut the story does not end there. Official projections peg mid-decade deficits—say, in 2015—at half a trillion dollars annually. Remember: After this recession has ended, after many of the stimulative measures taken over the past two years have played themselves out and after economic growth has resumed, our nation's debt will continue expanding at a rate of 3 to 4 percent per annum. Even if real tax revenue grows at an eye-popping 9 percent annual rate over the next five years, as projected by the White House, deficits as a share of the economy will be higher than the historical norm—and are scheduled to remain that way as far as the eye can see.\n\nLast year alone, the Treasury went to market to issue $2.1 trillion in debt. Estimates for this year broach $2.4 trillion. One might begin to worry that this level of financing would crowd out private-sector and other borrowers. But it hasn't—yet. In financing this massive debt issuance, we have benefitted from the need for large surplus savers, like the Chinese, to invest in deep, liquid markets. We have also benefited to a degree from the misery of others: Recent concerns about sovereign debt elsewhere—that of Greece and of some others in Europe, for example—have drawn money to the higher quality credit of the United States, keeping interest rates on Treasury debt low. As I entered this room, the 10-year Treasury was yielding 3.63 percent, a fortuitously low number.\n\nWe cannot count forever on the largess or the misfortune of others to mask our own imbalances here at home—for fiscal profligacy in Washington today hinders our ability to address fiscal challenges tomorrow.\n\nThese challenges are coming. Off balance sheet, there lie two massive, unfunded liabilities not accounted for in the \"conventional budget accounting\" of the federal government—most significantly, Social Security and the government obligations of current Medicare programs.\n\nPundits and analysts like to focus on the year in which Social Security will go permanently into the red on an annual cash flow basis—which recently was projected to occur in 2019 but could occur as early as 2016. But they largely ignore the severity of the broader problem: accumulated entitlement debt over the infinite horizon. According to our calculations at the Dallas Fed, that unfunded debt of Social Security and Medicare combined has now reached $104 trillion—trillion with a 'T'—in discounted present value. And while much attention in recent years has been devoted to Social Security, the lion's share of the total entitlement shortfall (nearly $90 trillion) actually comes from Medicare. This is a prodigious number. Others—like Pete Peterson's foundation, which uses a different time horizon in its methodology—calculate the unfunded liability at north of $40 trillion, growing by a sum of $2 trillion to $3 trillion per year.[2] No matter. The problem is frightful, whether you take his numbers or ours.\n\nMedicare is by far the most serious fiscal storm cloud on the horizon, and it is a storm we are poorly positioned to weather given the rapidly deteriorating medium-term deficit outlook. Yet maintaining economic growth over the long term requires us to do so.\n\nNow, balancing the fiscal books is not the job of a central banker like me. Making Medicare and the fiscal position of our country sound again falls on the shoulders of the Congress. Only the Congress can tax and spend our monies. That is its purview, not the Federal Reserve's. The disagreeable but sound burden of bringing us back to fiscal sanity now falls on its shoulders.\n\nIf you read Sunday's New York Times, you might be given to despair, wondering whether this is indeed doable. Buried far too deep in the front section—on page 22, perhaps deliberately on the penultimate page before the obituaries—was an article titled \"Spending Cuts Meet Selective Support.\" The subhead read \"Familiar Washington Complaint: Cut the Deficit, but Not That Way.\" It went on to single out House and Senate members, including Republican \"conservatives,\" who were all for cutting back on federal spending—as long as it did not occur in their districts. It vividly illustrated the struggle between national and parochial interests that results in ever darker red ink in the nation's income statement and an ever deeper hole in the nation's balance sheet. In that article, the situation was summarized perfectly by Arizona Congressman Jeff Flake, who said, \"There are not enough statesmen who will stand up and say, cut it even when it is in my district.\"[3]\n\nI have not had the pleasure of meeting Congressman Flake, but I suspect—if he has a sense of humor—he might find this little vignette from England to be a nice parody of how business appears to have been conducted on the Hill.[4]\n\nThis would all be very funny were it not so very sad. It is so easy to spend other people's money. It is, as Churchill said, so agreeable. But it is unsound. And, as the article in Sunday's Times makes clear, it is not a pleasure reserved for just one political party.\n\nWhen George Shultz was director of the Office of Management and Budget, he became frustrated with the spending impulses of the Nixon administration. He reports that he called the venerable Sam Cohen—a virtual encyclopedia of budgetary history—into his office and asked, \"Between you and me, Sam, is there really any difference between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to spending money?\" Cohen's reply was classic: \"Sir, there is only one difference: Democrats enjoy it more.\"\n\nMr. Cohen might have been a more \"equal opportunity\" wisecracker were he still around. Regardless, we are beyond the point of either party placing its immediate political needs ahead of the welfare of our children and successor generations.\n\nHere is where W. H. Auden comes to mind. In \"The Dyer's Hand,\" he wrote \"in the Fifth Circle on the Mount of [Dante's] Purgatory … I suspect that the Prodigals may be almost an American colony.\"[5]\n\nI would like very much for us to prove W. H. Auden wrong. The Fifth Circle of financial purgatory must not become an American colony. Recent reports would have it that the Fifth Circle is now being populated by the Greeks and other Europeans who have taken to fiscal profligacy. Some analysts seem poised to add to that roster Japan, whose economy faces a challenging fiscal predicament given their demographic trends. I would rather they not be joined by their American counterparts. I pray the president and the Senate and the House will set aside their parochial and partisan interests, stop kicking the can down the road and get on with the disagreeable but sound business of getting us out of the financial cul-de-sac they and their predecessors have driven us into.\n\nAs bad as the situation is, I know one thing that would make it worse, and that is if the Congress took the easy way out by turning to the Fed to simply print our legislators' way out of their misery, devaluing the debt they have incurred through their spendthrift ways.\n\nIn a recent issue, The Economist magazine gently chided me for what it considered a hyperbolic reference to the fate of the Weimar Republic—a fate I referenced as a potential outcome for the U.S.A., should the Congress take to the route of politicizing the Fed. Yet the article acknowledged that in times of economic duress, there is a temptation worldwide for political authorities to compromise their central banks, the most recent case being that of Argentina.[6] This temptation exists despite what policymakers know from history: that when fiscal authorities turn to monetary authorities to monetize their debts, the result is inevitably financial disaster.\n\nI got a glimpse of this firsthand in the Carter administration with the ill-advised imposition of credit controls. This was but one instance in a long history that stretches from the debauching of monetary probity in ancient Rome to the inflation disaster that is now modern Zimbabwe.\n\nIf you want a primer on what can go wrong when the independence of a central bank is compromised—even in countries considered invulnerable—turn to page 88 in Liaquat Ahamed's recent book, titled Lords of Finance. He notes that, when the Reichsbank was being formed by Bismarck in 1871, Bismarck's closest confidant, Gershon Bleichröder, \"warned [Bismarck] that there would be occasions when political considerations would have to override purely economic judgments and at such times too independent a central bank would be a nuisance.\"[7]\n\nIt is no small wonder that the political considerations of the First World War and the impulse to override what might have been the purely economic judgments of Germany's central bank led to the hyper-inflation of the Weimar Republic and the utter destruction of the once mighty German economy. I beg to differ with Herr Bleichröder. It is more important than ever that we maintain the independence of our central bank, keeping it free from being overridden by political considerations. As the executive and legislative branches seek to navigate our economy to safe harbor, they must minimize the impulse to let political exigencies hamper the work of the Federal Reserve. If, in the process of doing what is right and proper by confining its activity to its singular purpose, the Federal Reserve becomes a \"nuisance,\" so be it. The Fed under Paul Volcker's leadership was certainly a \"nuisance.\" Reagan administration officials sought to reign in the Fed, and senators and congressmen on both the right and left called for Volcker's removal from office. But you would be hard-pressed to find anyone alive today who would argue the fact that the Volcker Fed pulled the nation from the precipice of economic calamity and severe inflation. Now, as then, it is important that the Federal Reserve be left to do its job and no more.\n\nI ask you to beware of several political initiatives that threaten the Fed's independence. For example, the House of Representatives recently passed legislation that would require audits by the Government Accountability Office—not simply of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, but also of its monetary policy decisions. The idea of expanded Fed audits was initially introduced just last February and was eventually cosponsored by well over 300 representatives, including 28 of Texas' 32 members. There are other initiatives from other House and Senate members that would make the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve banks, or even the chairmen of their boards, subject to presidential appointment and Senate confirmation, upsetting the delicate balance forged nearly a hundred years ago between Main Street and the Washington political elite.\n\nIndependent does not mean unaccountable. We have always been subject to appropriate oversight. Since Ben Bernanke took the chair, we have ramped up our efforts to be as transparent as is prudent in the conduct of monetary policy. For example, the Fed is the only business in America that I know of that provides a public accounting of its balance sheet every week—it is called the H.4.1 release, and you may pull it up yourself on the Internet on a weekly basis. We submit a monetary policy report to the Congress twice per year, at which time our chairman makes his trek to the Hill to deliver his Humphrey–Hawkins testimony and answer questions from members of the House and Senate.\n\nI suppose another set of eyes might provide further confidence regarding our holdings. But making the discussions held by my colleagues and me at the FOMC subject to congressional second-guessing, under the guise of auditing monetary policy deliberations, or creating a process where apolitical bank presidents have to worry about satisfying Washington powers rather than representing their districts' views—thus upsetting the delicate balance that prevails at FOMC deliberations—risks putting us on the road that leads to the fate suffered by once-great economies like pre-Weimar Germany.\n\nA great and powerful economy cannot create the conditions for sustainable, noninflationary growth if its central bank is governed by a politicized monetary authority.\n\nNow, let me be clear: I do not believe the Fed to be blameless in the run-up to the crisis we are now working our way out of. For quite some time, I have respectfully differed with Chairman Bernanke, saying that I felt the Fed held interest rates too low for too long in the early half of the 2000s, thus fueling reckless speculation in housing and other sectors.[8] And I have freely admitted that a host of regulators, including those at the Federal Reserve, were caught unawares by the risk being taken by large financial institutions that later came a cropper.\n\nThis does not mean, however, that those who dwell in the political realm should try to \"fix\" the problem by throwing themselves into the monetary mix. We should not now politicize an institution that, in the turbulence of this period, pulled our economy back from the brink of the abyss and has now taken significant steps to repair the holes in its regulatory and supervisory apparatus. As a central bank, we had the flexibility to expand our balance sheet to shore up the financial system and put out a fire. In comparison with the Treasury, we had a greater ability to quickly lend against collateral with the flexibility that Congress granted to the central bank years ago. Our current structure gives us the ability to put out fires while remaining accountable after the fact. I would advise the Congress to leave well enough alone.\n\nThe other day, I opened a bottle of iced tea bottled by a company named, appropriately, Honest Tea. Printed in the cap was the English translation of what it said was a Chinese proverb. It read: \"If we don't change the direction we are headed, we will end up where we are going.\" Students of history are keenly aware of the course we chart when we discuss the possibility of politicizing the Federal Reserve System, in lieu of Congress bearing down and solving its fiscal woes. It would put the United States on a road that leads directly to economic ruin.\n\nI am tempted to end this cheery talk by saying \"Have a nice day!\" and walking off the stage. However, I would hate to leave this podium with your having concluded that I am just another sourpuss. It's true: Like all central bankers, I am genetically programmed to worry. But I am also a red-blooded American, as are all my colleagues at the Fed. In the end, I draw on the wisdom not just of Churchill or W. H. Auden or history as recounted by Liaquat Ahamed or the lyrics of George Jones, but on the words of someone I doubt you ever heard of: Marcus Nadler, one of the great minds of the Federal Reserve during a period when our economy endured an even greater \"stress test.\"\n\nTo counter the intellectual paralysis and down-in-the-mouth pessimism that gripped the financial industry after the Crash of '29, Nadler put forth four simple propositions:\n\nFirst, he said: You're right if you bet that the United States economy will continue to expand.\n\nSecond: You're wrong if you bet that it is going to stand still or collapse.\n\nThird: You're wrong if you bet that any one element in our society is going to wreck the country.\n\nAnd fourth: You're right if you bet that leaders in business, labor and government are sane, reasonably well-informed and decent people who can be counted on to find common ground among all their conflicting interests and work out a compromise solution to the big issues that confront them.\n\nIt may seem like the stuff of our wildest dreams to imagine our sisters and brothers in Congress finding the way to forge a solution for their woeful fiscal predicament. But I believe they can and they will. After all, one of the three great parables in the Book of Luke is that of the Prodigal Son (which, convenient for the purposes of this speech, follows the Parable of the Lost Coin): \"We had to celebrate and be glad; this brother of yours … is alive again; he was lost and is found.\"[9] Besides, we are Americans. Americans rise to the occasion no matter how great the challenge. We have done it time and again. We have no choice but to do it once more, now.",

            "content": "January 12, 2010 Waco, Texas\n\nThank you, Willard [Still].\n\nOver the years, I have had the great pleasure of having many friends here in Waco. Nancy and I remember especially fondly the Cotton Palace events in which two of our children, Anders and Alison, participated many years ago and the wonderful time we spent around those great weekends with the Dietzes, the Browns, the Olsons—that was before he became a big deal ambassador to Sweden, where he did a superb job—and the Rapoports and so many other big-hearted Wacoans. Most everyone here tonight knows that the freshman women’s dorm at Baylor, Ruth Collins Hall, is named for my wife’s grandmother and that Nancy’s granddaddy, Carr P. Collins, played a major role in nurturing Baylor (I am reminded of him every time I wander past that stern portrait of him on campus). So it is a genuine pleasure for me to be here in Waco addressing the members of the Waco Business League. I love this city and its people. Thank you for inviting me.\n\nThese are times that try men’s and women’s souls: They are not particularly felicitous economic times. The Federal Reserve has worked tirelessly for the past two years to rescue the financial system and the economy from plunging into the abyss of depression and chaos. As last year came to a close, we saw our efforts begin to bear some fruit: Interest rates and spreads between the yields on various key financial instruments have come down significantly. The markets for bonds and stocks have come back to life, and the economy—while subject to taking one step back for every few it takes forward—has nonetheless begun a palpable, if tepid, recovery.\n\nWe are not yet out of the woods.\n\nThere are many roadblocks we must overcome to get our economic engine running full steam again. Businesses must develop sufficient confidence in the future to begin expanding their order books and payrolls. Banks must be willing and able to lend again. Consumers must regain the wherewithal and the confidence to open their pocketbooks. Tonight, I want to talk about two obstacles I see that are threatening the removal of these roadblocks. The first is widespread concern about our nation’s fiscal predicament. The second is the risk that Congress will seek to politicize the Federal Reserve.\n\nBefore getting into these weighty matters, let me demystify the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nThis is a Federal Reserve note, otherwise known as a dollar bill. If you look closely at the face of the one dollar note, you will see that in the middle of the left side is the letter “K,” surrounded by two concentric circles. The outer circle says “Federal Reserve” and “Texas,” and the inner circle says “Bank of” and “Dallas.” “K” is the 11th letter in the alphabet—in all four corners of the bill are printed the number “11.” The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas is responsible for the administration of the Federal Reserve’s affairs in the 11th of 12 Federal Reserve Districts that were set up by Congress under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. Every one dollar bill bears the imprint of one of the Federal Reserve Banks, starting with the “A” of the Boston Fed and ending with the “L” of the San Francisco Fed. Presently, there is nearly $1 trillion worth of Federal Reserve notes in circulation (Of course, you know that Dallas Fed dollars are of greater nominal value than the others!).\n\nThe economic activity conducted within some 350,000 square miles north, south, east and west of Waco by the roughly 26 million people in the Eleventh District—stretching from southern New Mexico, through all of Texas and across the wooded north of Louisiana—is serviced by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and its three branches.\n\nI am the president and CEO of a $70 billion bank. That bank operates at a profit—a profit that we send to the Treasury. Indeed, as we just announced this morning, the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, collectively, expect to transfer $46 billion to the Treasury for 2009. You are looking at an individual affiliated with one of the few public agencies that actually pay down the federal deficit.\n\nWhat do we do for those 26 million people in the Eleventh District? For starters, we make sure they have the cash they need. Last year, the Dallas Fed distributed and received almost 6 billion circulating banknotes, worth nearly $103 billion at face value. Our mammoth machines scan the cash at an average rate around 100,000 bills per hour and process them so they can be shipped from our vaults to banks throughout our district, providing you and the other citizens in our district with folding money. Of course, in addition to making sure there is a sufficient amount in circulation, we have to make sure your folding money is valid and looks respectable: Each month, we cull hundreds of counterfeit bills, and we pluck out over 38 million worn bills that have lived a full life and are ready to be shredded, sent off to Money Heaven and replaced by new, crisp notes.\n\nWe also process checks. In 2009, the Dallas Fed processed 120 million paper checks. The use of paper checks has been, and will continue to be, on a substantial decline as consumers and businesses take up electronic counterparts. Due to advances in technology, most banks now send us checks in a digital format. We received and processed an average of 70 million electronic images each month last year.\n\nAnother important function of the Dallas Fed is to provide liquidity to District depository institutions through our discount window operations—in other words, to be the ultimate banker’s bank. Those of you in this room who are at all affiliated with depository institutions are certainly aware of this vital function. The lending programs that make up our discount window help relieve liquidity strains by providing a source of short-term funding, which is fully secured and collateralized, to depository institutions to help them conduct uninterrupted business on behalf of you and their other customers. In 2008, we made 273 loans at the Dallas Fed, approximating $30 billion, and in 2009, we made just under 600 loans approximating a similar total. I chair our credit committee and personally review the loans we make every evening. Their size and structure depend on the needs of the borrowing bank.\n\nAmong our other responsibilities is supervising the banking industry within our district. We conduct on-site audits of our state-chartered member banks and bank holding companies and monitor bank performance and stability using electronic surveillance technologies.\n\nThis supervisory role is important. I began my private-sector career at the bank of Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., where my superiors instilled in me one overarching principle—one I’m sure the bankers in this room know quite well: Know your customer. Well, we at the Fed rely upon our regulatory relationship to better “know our customers,” actively monitoring our constituents’ needs and services on the front line of the commercial banking industry and using this insight to be better lenders to all our customers. Without that supervisory and regulatory responsibility, we could not operate effectively as the nation’s lender of last resort. Moreover, the knowledge gained through banking supervision aids the formation of monetary policy.\n\nThe Dallas Fed also organizes public education programs designed to raise financial and economic literacy in our community. We frequently host public events and conferences on significant activities within our economy.\n\nCurrency and check processing, banking supervision, lending as a banker’s bank and public education efforts are integral parts of the Federal Reserve’s job. But you wouldn’t know it if you read the papers: They are not the parts of central banking that usually garner the most public attention. The sexier bits of what I do—to the extent anything in central banking is considered “sexy”—deal with monetary policy.\n\nThe presidents of the 12 Fed banks, in addition to the five governors of the Federal Reserve Board (two shy of normal, thanks to a holdup in the nomination and confirmation process), normally meet every six weeks to discuss the current trajectory of the economy and craft the appropriate policy response. We do so in a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, commonly known as the FOMC. It is in these meetings that we set the base interest rate for interbank lending known as the federal funds, or “fed funds,” rate and where we develop other monetary policy initiatives, like the various programs we put in place to restore liquidity in the commercial paper and mortgage and other markets during the recent financial crisis.\n\nI come to each FOMC meeting armed with input from a research team that provides the intellectual heft for informed monetary policymaking, as well as insights provided by my board of directors and the many businesses—large and small—that populate my district and with whom I constantly consult. The Dallas Fed employs a crack team of economists and analysts who study the local, national and international economies. Their work is top-notch. Few of you might know, for example, that Finn Kydland, an advisor to our research team in Dallas for the past 15 years, won the Nobel Prize in economics in 2004.\n\nThe FOMC is one of the few public service decisionmaking bodies in the world where members can come together and, in the span of only a few hours, present their positions without fear of political retribution and without posturing for the cameras, then hammer out agreement on a course of action based solely on what they solemnly consider judicious for the long-term health of the economy rather than for political convenience. By 2:15 on the afternoon in which we conclude our discussion, we craft a statement for public release explaining the actions taken. We release a lengthy set of minutes of our deliberations three weeks after our meeting.\n\nThe FOMC is where Texas and the parts of Louisiana and New Mexico that we cover have a voice at the policymaking table for the most powerful and essential central bank in the world. The president of the United States appoints and the Senate confirms the governors of the Federal Reserve System. The 12 Federal Reserve bankers like me who sit side by side with those governors are not subject to that process. We are hired and fired by nine-member boards of directors that represent the financial institutions and stakeholders and economic diversity of our respective districts. I want to make this clear: I am not accountable to any Washington politicos, be they Democrat or Republican. I am politically neutered, devoutly nonpartisan and guided solely by what I believe is the best way to craft policy so as to encourage sustainable economic growth with price stability, regardless of who is in the White House or the Congress. I represent only the views and ideals of my part of the country. My fellow bank presidents and I represent Main Street, not the Washington or Wall Street establishment. I want you to know that every time I speak or intervene in our policy discussion at the FOMC—which is quite often (I am, after all, a Texan)—I do so very much with that in mind.\n\nWhich brings me around to what currently preoccupies me.\n\nOver the holidays, I read two terrific books about Winston Churchill by two eminent historians: Paul Johnson’s just published tome simply titled Churchill and Richard Langworth’s remarkable compendium of everything Churchill ever said, or didn’t actually say, appropriately titled Churchill by Himself.\n\nLangworth cites a speech given by Churchill at the Waldorf Hotel in London in 1926 in which he noted that “in finance, everything that is agreeable is unsound and everything that is sound is disagreeable.”[1]\n\nIn his book, Johnson notes that in the debacle that surrounded the attempt to seize the Dardanelles—that narrow strip that was the key to the Sea of Marmara and Istanbul in the First World War—Churchill advocated the right policy but made some blunders as head of the Admiralty. He was thus sacked by a desperate prime minister, Asquith, leading a desperate parliament. Here are the passages from Johnson that caught my eye: “If Asquith had then appointed Churchill supremo of the operation,” Johnson wrote, “the campaign might still have succeeded.” But “Churchill was out and had to watch, impotent and silent, while the politicians … compounded their mistakes and the operation, after a quarter of a million casualties, ended in ignominious evacuation. Though an official inquiry eventually exonerated [Churchill], at the time (which is what mattered) he got the blame. As Theodore Roosevelt once remarked of a financial crisis: ‘When people have lost their money, they strike out unthinkingly, like a wounded snake, at whoever is most prominent in the line of vision.’”[2]\n\nHold that thought about how political imperatives resulted in a disaster and the business about “[striking] out unthinkingly, like a wounded snake, at whoever is most prominent in the line of vision.” I’d like first to dwell on the problem of what is agreeable but unsound.\n\nWhile it appears urgent, if not agreeable, to use massive public spending to stimulate an economy under duress, an economy cannot sustain long-term growth under the weight of significant fiscal burdens. At some point, what is considered a temporary economic prosthesis becomes a hindrance to the workings of the private sector.\n\nOver the past 10 years, discretionary spending has grown at an average real annual rate of 5 percent, outpacing the 2.6 percent annual growth rate of the overall economy during that period. And discretionary spending for fiscal 2010, excluding defense and stimulus-related items, is currently forecast to grow by 8.2 percent nominally. Add to this the double-digit dips in last year’s federal and state tax revenue, and you’ve got quite a fiscal pickle.\n\nWhen tax receipts fall while discretionary spending soars, deficits are an expected consequence. A shortfall of nearly half a trillion dollars in fiscal 2008 was quickly supplanted in the history books by a $1.4 trillion shortfall last year—10 percent of GDP. The most optimistic projections peg mid-decade deficits—while fortunately lower—at an eye-popping $300 billion annually. Remember: We’re talking about a time after this recession has ended, after at least some of the Bush tax cuts have expired and after fiscal stimulus will have largely played itself out.\n\nUnfortunately, fiscal profligacy today hinders our ability to address fiscal challenges tomorrow.\n\nThose challenges are coming. Pundits and analysts like to focus on the year in which Social Security will go permanently into the red on an annual cash flow basis—which recently was projected to occur in 2019 but could occur as early as 2016. But they largely ignore the more pressing problem: accumulated entitlement debt over the infinite horizon. That debt has now reached $104 trillion—trillion with a ‘T’—in discounted present value terms. The lion’s share of the shortfall (nearly $90 trillion) comes from Medicare—not Social Security.\n\nMedicare is by far the most serious fiscal storm cloud on the horizon, and it is a cloud we are poorly positioned to weather given the rapidly deteriorating medium-term deficit outlook. Yet maintaining economic growth over the long term requires us to do so.\n\nNow, this is not the job of a central banker like me. The burden of doing the disagreeable thing to make Medicare and the fiscal position of our country sound falls on the shoulders of the Congress. Only the Congress can tax and spend our monies. That is its purview, not the Federal Reserve’s. For too long, the Congress, under both Republican and Democratic leadership and with both Republicans and Democrats in the White House, has chosen the most agreeable but unsound path of kicking the fiscal can down the road. The disagreeable but sound burden of bringing us back to fiscal sanity now falls on its shoulders, and I pray its members will find the resolve and the support from their constituents to get it done.\n\nI know one thing, however, that would make this predicament worse, and that is if the Congress decided to turn to the Fed to print its way out of the fiduciary cul de sac it has driven itself into. This leads us to the Roosevelt quote and the lesson imparted by Paul Johnson about Churchill’s experience with the Dardanelles fiasco.\n\nWe know from history that when fiscal authorities turn to the monetary authority to monetize their debts, the result is inevitably inflation and financial ruin. This is the lesson learned from Ancient Rome, from Weimar Germany, from Nationalist China, from Argentina and, in its most egregious present form, from modern Zimbabwe.\n\nPresently, there are before the Congress of the United States several acts suggested by advocates in both parties that would result in putting the Federal Reserve under direct command of the fiscal authorities. These acts sound agreeable at first blush, but remember that “in finance, everything that is agreeable is unsound.” I wouldn’t go so far as to say, as Teddy Roosevelt did, that they are striking out “unthinkingly, like a wounded snake, at whoever is most prominent in the line of vision.” I believe many of their advocates truly believe they are being thoughtful. But I note that the Federal Reserve, having taken great and significant actions and risks to save the financial system from imploding, is, like Churchill, very much “in the line of vision.” Both Republicans and Democrats, eager to come up with solutions in desperate times, appear to me to be playing something like Asquith to our Churchill—eager to defenestrate the Fed because, at the present moment, it seems like the most agreeable thing to do.\n\nFor example, the House of Representatives recently passed legislation that would require audits by the General Accountability Office, not simply of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, but also of our monetary policy decisions. This was initially signed on to by over 300 members, including some who are well known by this audience and represent the great state of Texas. There are other initiatives from other House members and senators that would make the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks or even the chairmen of their boards subject to presidential appointment and Senate confirmation.\n\nWhile the Fed is the only business in America that I know of that provides a public accounting of its balance sheet every week—it is called the H.4.1 release and you may pull it up yourself on the Internet on a weekly basis—I suppose another set of eyes might provide further confidence regarding our holdings. But making the discussions held by me and my colleagues at the FOMC subject to congressional second-guessing or creating a process where bank presidents and their politically independent boards have to worry about satisfying Washington powers rather than representing their districts’ views—thus upsetting the delicate balance that prevails at FOMC deliberations—can only lead us straight to the fate that was suffered by once great economies like pre-Weimar Germany and pre-Perón Argentina.\n\nIn Monday’s New York Times, the currently embattled president of the Bank of Argentina noted that he is the 55th to serve in that role in 75 years. He went on to say: “That makes the Argentine system unstable.”[3] I would hate to see some future Federal Reserve chairman utter those very same words about the United States of America.\n\nA great and powerful economy cannot create the conditions for sustainable noninflationary growth if its central bank is governed by a politicized monetary authority.\n\nNow, let me be clear: I do not believe the Fed to be blameless in the run-up to our current crisis. For quite some time I’ve said that I felt the Fed held interest rates too low for too long in the early half of the 2000s, thus fueling reckless speculation in housing and other sectors.[4] And I have freely admitted that a host of regulators, including those at the Federal Reserve, were caught unawares by the risk being taken by large financial institutions that later came a cropper.\n\nThis does not mean that those who dwell in the political realm should try to “fix” the problem by throwing themselves into the monetary mix. We should not now politicize an institution that, in the turbulence of this period, pulled our economy back from the brink of the abyss and has taken significant steps to repair the holes in its regulatory and supervisory apparatus. As a central bank, we had the flexibility to expand our balance sheet to shore up the financial system and put out the fire. In comparison with the Treasury, we had a greater ability to quickly lend against collateral. And we did so not only in accordance with the flexibility that Congress granted to the central bank years ago, but also in consultation with the Treasury in a way that did not politically constrain us. In this way, our current structure gives us the ability to put out fires while remaining accountable after the fact.\n\nThe other day, I opened a bottle of iced tea bottled by a company named, appropriately, Honest Tea. Printed in the cap was the English translation of what it said was a Chinese proverb. It read: “If we don’t change the direction we are headed, we will end up where we are going.” Students of history are keenly aware of the course we chart when we discuss the possibility of politicizing the Federal Reserve System. They know by heart the pathologies that afflicted Weimar Germany and modern Zimbabwe, ancient Rome and the economic mess that remains Argentina. Those who will determine the future scope and shape of our central bank would do well to keep those pathologies in mind and resist the agreeable urge to “strike out” at the Fed. I know there are many senators and members of the House of Representatives who understand this well and will, in the end, resist that temptation. I want to be on record here tonight in reminding these good people that if the Congress is not careful and ends up where it is going in tampering with the independence of the Federal Reserve, it will indeed lead us down the path to the politicization of the central bank of the world’s greatest economy, putting the United States on a road that leads directly to economic ruin.\n\nEnough of this dismal stuff. While I am a banker and have been trained all my life to be sober and skeptical, I am not given to seeing every glass half empty. Let me end with a more upbeat scenario.\n\nConsider that in the year 1667 John Dryden wrote a poem titled “Annus Mirabilis”—“Year of Miracles.” The year of miracles began with the Great Plague of London—a pandemic akin to the bubonic plague—and ended with the Great Fire that burned London for five days. Dryden might easily have referred to the year as an “annus horribilis”—a horrible year—rather than a year of miracles.\n\nSo why did Dryden call it the “Year of Miracles?” Because from the wreckage, London rebuilt itself and arose from the ashes with wide streets, modern sewers and buildings commissioned by Charles II and designed by the great architect Christopher Wren—buildings so solidly constructed that they last to this day. Our task is to turn the current “horribilis” economy into an opportunity, just as the Brits did nearly 350 years ago, so that we will emerge from the current economic wreckage stronger and better and more resilient than ever. If England could do it in the 17th century, we can certainly do it today. Turning something “horribilis” into a thing that is “mirabilis” is the quintessential American—and Texan—thing to do.\n\nSo I ask you tonight to do two things: First, carefully consider the risk of politicizing the Fed and so guide your elected representatives. And second, take advantage of the opportunities that always abound in times of adversity. My job is to continue working to create the monetary conditions that make for sustained, noninflationary growth and well-functioning financial markets—to keep that Federal Reserve banknote worthy of being the currency of a great power. Your job is to take advantage of a healthy, nonpoliticized monetary policy and financial stability and make the investments and create the businesses that have led this great country of ours to unparalleled economic success.\n\nAmericans are at their best when we confront our problems squarely, pick ourselves up and overcome the most horrific obstacles we face to accomplish economic miracles. We’ve been doing that for over 200 years. We can’t stop now. Let’s get on with it.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "December 8, 2009 Austin, Texas\n\nThank you, Barry [Mayer].\n\nThere are many distinguished Texans in this room. I would like to single out one of them: my daughter, Alison. I am very proud of her. She inherited her mother’s brains and graduated with honors in English literature from Harvard, where she was president of the Seneca, one of the largest women’s service organizations on the Harvard campus. Alison is now a graduate student at UT–Austin, in her second year at the LBJ School of Public Affairs. She is not only smart and strong and beautiful, but she is tolerant—so much so, she is even willing to sit through one of her father’s speeches. I am thrilled she is here.\n\nEducation is something I hold dear to my heart. It changed my life. Neither of my parents—Alison’s paternal grandparents—was formally educated. My father never made it past fourth grade. In lieu of middle school and high school, he swept floors under the lathes at a metalworking factory in Australia. My mother, a stern Norwegian raised in South Africa, attended the equivalent of a secretarial high school. They wanted better for me. Among the many fond memories I have of my mother, God rest her soul, two came to mind as I prepared this little sermon for today. The first was our twice-monthly trek when I was 12 to a local store to get the latest installment of the Golden Book Encyclopedia—these were the only books we could readily afford in our household at the time. Golden Books issued one volume per letter of the alphabet, and she insisted I read it cover to cover in order to “earn” the next volume. The second was her admonition that I had “better do well in school and learn to love to learn” because, in her stern words, “you can’t expect to get by in America just relying on your looks or your athletic ability.”\n\nIn his introduction, Barry listed all those great schools I was lucky to attend and all the fancy jobs I’ve had—shorthand in our resume-driven society for “he’s done all right.” All that can be traced back to a determined mother and the Golden Book Encyclopedia, as well as some inspirational teachers in primary and secondary school and a pragmatic father. When I got my M.B.A. from Stanford, my dad pulled me aside and said: “Enough already. In one generation, we’ve gone from no education to too much! Now get a job and go to work!”\n\nI have a job to do today, so I better go to work speaking on the topic you asked me here for: the subject of education.\n\nThe benefits we derive from the books and the buildings and the teachers and tutors that form the building blocks of our educational society don’t stop at the classroom door. They spread outward, affecting our lives and the lives of others around us in innumerable ways. Today I am going to speak from the perspective of the economy and living standards, a principal preoccupation of the Federal Reserve.\n\nThere are countless studies in the economics literature that highlight the links between increases in educational levels and economic productivity and improvements in society’s welfare. Employment is significantly higher among the more educated. Workers with a college degree experience lower fluctuations in employment and, if they do lose their jobs in tough times such as these, do so at a lower rate than their less-educated peers and are more likely to find new jobs.\n\nThe simple fact is you earn what you learn. Education pays off. We can see this in the wage data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Last year, the average hourly wage in Texas was $18.90. In the same period, the average hourly wage in Texas for internal medicine doctors was $77.22, $42.67 for geological engineers, $43.50 for computer engineers and $29.70 for nurses. The more you learn, the more you earn.\n\nIn 1980, a college degree would earn you about 50 percent more than a high school diploma. In 1990, that differential jumped to 73 percent and, in 2000, to 85 percent. Today, someone who holds a college degree earns 97 percent more than his or her classmate who went no further than high school.\n\nYou earn what you learn. Higher education is the key to improved earnings and social prosperity.\n\nThis is no great mystery. We make our living as Americans less with our muscles than we do with our brains. At the beginning of the 20th century, when my parents were born, 37 percent of the U.S. workforce was employed in agriculture. Today, in Alison’s world, agricultural output represents less than 2 percent of our gross domestic product and employs just over 1 percent of our workers. In 1900, 38 percent of our labor force worked in “industry,” a broad category that includes manufacturing, construction and mining. Today, manufacturing employs 10 percent of our workforce, and mining—less than 1 percent.\n\nThe delivery of services has replaced ag and manufacturing and mining and oil and gas and is the engine of our growth. At the beginning of the 20th century, 26 percent of our workforce was employed in services. Today that number is about 80 percent. We are a service-driven economy. Winston Churchill used to refer in his speeches to the “superfine processes” that added value to basic raw material inputs in the era when Britannia ruled the waves of the Manufacturing Age economy. Today, we live at an ever-higher end of the value-added spectrum, with education being the stuff of our economic success.\n\nWe have the most efficient services workers in the world. Contrary to popular belief, we sell those services not just at home, but around the globe. Sales of things like computer and information services, research and development, accounting and auditing, and management and consulting earn us substantial foreign income—so much so that while we run a deficit in our trade in goods with the rest of the world, we run a surplus in our trade in services. It trims our overall trade deficit some 20 percent from what it would otherwise be.\n\nEven lawyers make money abroad. Imagine that! Our exports of legal services in 2008 were four times our imports. In the same year, exports in advertising, finance, medical services and education exceeded our imports in these categories by a factor of three. And thanks to Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise and Angelina Jolie and Jessica Simpson—and, indeed, despite Sunday night’s ignominious defeat, Jessica’s ex, Tony Romo—our foreign distribution of films, TV shows, performing arts and sports programming and products are in such tremendous demand abroad that their overseas sales exceed our imports by a factor of seven.\n\nThe point is this: The fields and factories that powered the economy of yesterday remain important in the United States and in Texas. But more important in the current economy and to our economic future is the production of high-value-added services. As some have previously noted, in the world of “superfine processes” of the Knowledge Age, digits are the new widgets. The brain is to the Knowledge Age and the mastery of digits what the engine was to the Manufacturing Age and the management of widgets. Education is the steam and the oil and the gas that propel that engine. The speed at which we move our economy forward from this point onward will depend on how well we educate our children. We cannot produce the skilled labor needed to advance this economy without a top-notch educational system—one that relentlessly pushes America farther up the value-added ladder while the Chinese and the Indians and others scurry up the lower rungs of that ladder with their billions of eager workers and ever-more agile grasp of the most basic tools of technology.\n\nAs I understand this conference, you all are here to “grade [your] own paper”—to assess your efforts to create a top-notch educational system here in this great city and state.\n\nGene [Austin], you wrote a comprehensive piece on this subject just last month in the Austin American-Statesman. I agree that many efforts undertaken at the state and local levels—like the “20,010 by 2010” initiative—are producing real results. But we cannot declare victory yet. We have many, many miles to go before we sleep.\n\nPersonally, I will not sleep until we get our higher education house in order. For a state as great as Texas, we are woefully lacking in tier-one universities.\n\nI want you to consider the following. It is fashionable in economic and financial circles to talk about the “BRIC” nations: Brazil and Russia, India and China. Yet, in the second quarter of this year, Texas produced more than two of those four countries did: more than Russia and more than India. And we were not all that far behind Brazil. You heard me correctly. The 24 million people of the Lone Star State, in the second quarter of this year, produced more in dollar-denominated economic output than the 1.1 billion people of India or the 140 million of Russia, at then-current exchange rates, and about 81 percent of what Brazil produced with half of South America’s population and just under half of South America’s land mass.\n\nTexas is a global economic power, surpassed in the United States only by California. So far, so good. But as you look into the future of the Knowledge Age and contemplate the ambition of the BRIC countries and others that will compete with us for a piece of the global economic pie, the picture darkens.\n\nConsider this: Texas has six major public university systems. The University of Texas System, whose home is right here in Austin, is the granddaddy of them all, with just under 200,000 students in nine universities and six health institutions. The Texas A&M System has 11 universities with 100,000-plus students and a multicampus health science center. The remaining students are spread over the campuses of the Texas State University System, the University of North Texas System, the University of Houston System and the Texas Tech System. Stephen F. Austin, Midwestern State, Texas Southern and Texas Woman’s are each independent public universities. Together, these institutions house over 530,000 students.\n\nBy contrast, California has more than 650,000 students enrolled at just 33 public campuses. The granddaddy of that state educational system is the University of California, with 220,000 students spread over 10 universities.\n\nHow many people in this room think that Berkeley is the only center of excellence in the University of California System? Not one of you. That is because you know that in addition to Berkeley, the University of California System has UCLA, UC–San Diego, UC–Irvine, UC–Davis and UC–Santa Barbara. All that before you take into account Stanford, USC, Caltech and the Claremont Colleges.\n\nNow here is a fact we must face up to. According to the latest U.S. News & World Report survey, Berkeley, UCLA, UC–San Diego, UC–Davis, UC–Santa Barbara and UC–Irvine all outranked our beloved UT–Austin—which placed 47th—for overall educational excellence. And the rest of our universities? The Aggies in College Station ranked 61st. The Mustangs of SMU ranked 68th, the Baylor Bears 80th and the Horned Frogs of TCU, 110th. The shining stars of our higher education galaxy are the appropriately named Owls of Rice, ranked 17th behind Johns Hopkins, tied with Vanderbilt and above Berkeley.\n\nIt galls me that the “overtaxed, overregulated, left coast state” of California has within one fleet six universities that are ranked better than UT–Austin, our flagship. It bothers me to no end that we have only one university in our state that ranks in the top 20 in the nation.\n\nWhen you get a chance, take a look at the membership list for the Association of American Universities (AAU), which is regarded by most scholars as the definition of the cream of the crop of research universities. The AAU consists of 60 U.S. and two Canadian universities. These 60 U.S. schools garner about 57 percent of all federal R&D dollars to colleges and universities; they are home to 81 percent of all elected members of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine—the highest recognition in each of those fields. Since 1901, 35 percent of all Nobel Prizes have gone to individuals affiliated with AAU universities. It is fair to say that everyone in this room would like to have our Texas universities included in this prestigious group of 60.\n\nCalifornia has nine AAU members, with four of those in the greater Los Angeles area alone. New York has seven: Columbia, Cornell, New York University, Syracuse, Stony Brook University, the University of Rochester and the University of Buffalo. You actually should add an eighth by including Rutgers, which is within arm’s reach of New York City.\n\nAnd Texas? We have three: Rice, UT–Austin and Texas A&M.\n\nThink about it. The great state of Texas—the state I love to brag and boast about, a state that has a glorious history second to none—has the same number of AAU member universities as Boston. The Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex—my hometown—has … none. Think about that: The fourth-largest metropolitan district in America does not have a single top-ranked academic institution. We do have UT–Southwestern, a top-tier medical school, of course. But a medical school standing alone, no matter how good, is not enough in a world that is built on advanced technology and in-depth knowledge across many fields.\n\nNow, how can we expect to navigate our way into the economic future in a fiercely competitive globalized world without a single elite university in Dallas? Or with only one in the great city of Houston? With a university ranked 47th in Austin? And with none of the top 50 in any other city in Texas? How can we expect Texas to continue to out-produce India and Russia and other hungry competitors and excel in the Knowledge Age—an era in which prosperity and wealth will be defined by cyberspace, nanotechnology, robotics and biology and mathematics-driven financial expertise—with so few established fountainheads of advanced knowledge? How can we reasonably expect to prepare the youth of today—a group that I know you all care about, or else you would not have sacrificed your time to be here—if we aren’t providing them with top-notch preparation for the economy of tomorrow?\n\nWhen we leave this luncheon today, I want you to look around Austin’s cityscape. When you travel to Dallas or Houston or any of our other great cities, look at their skylines. How many factories will you see? You won’t see any—at least none of the old-fashioned kind with smokestacks and loading docks and noisy machines. Instead, you will see glass and steel buildings that house the machines and the capital stock of the modern economy: human brains. Brains that are employed in many of the high-value-added sectors I described earlier.\n\nWe need more of that brainpower, right here in River City. We need thousands upon thousands of the world’s best and brightest here in Texas, here in Austin, and in Houston and Dallas and Fort Worth and every nook and cranny of South and East and West Texas. We can fuel our economy with graduates from California and Massachusetts and other states and other countries—up to a point. But that is no substitute for Texas-bred intellectual talent, with its roots in our community and its commitment to building our state and all the benefits it would bring to our arts and civic and educational communities, on top of the economic muscle it would add.\n\nLike everybody in this room, I swelled with pride when I watched Hunter Lawrence put that football through the uprights in the last second of Saturday night’s game at the “House that Jerry Built.” I delight in seeing TCU ranked among the nation’s top teams. As a former high school quarterback, I love dropping in on high school games on Friday nights. And whenever I lecture these days at our universities across the state, I can’t help but notice how handsome or beautiful the young men and women are in our classrooms.\n\nBut then I think back to my mother’s admonition: “You can’t expect to get by in America just relying on your looks or your athletic ability.” We can’t expect Texas to get by, let alone dominate, in a globalized economy where digits are the new widgets simply by relying on our good looks and athletic prowess.\n\nHere is the punch line: If you are willing to leave this room today accepting the fact that we have only two universities ranked in the top 50 in the nation and only one, Rice, in the top 20, then you are not the Texans I know and love. If you are willing to accept that the Longhorns of UT–Austin, mighty as they are, are outflanked on the educational battlefield by six campuses of the UC System, then I have severely overestimated your commitment to this great state of ours. If any of you are willing to accept that Guy Bailey at Texas Tech or David Daniel at the University of Texas at Dallas or Gerald Turner at SMU or Victor Boschini at TCU or Ricardo Romo at UT–San Antonio or Diana Natalicio at UTEP or Renu Khator at the University of Houston or Bowen Loftin at Texas A&M or William Powers here at UT–Austin is fighting with one hand tied behind his or her back because the powers-that-be here in the capital cannot rise to the cause and give to this state what California has in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, or Los Angeles or San Diego or Santa Barbara, or what New York has in Manhattan, Rochester or Buffalo, then, well, you, my friends, are suffering from a serious case of denial.\n\n“Denying” the people of Texas the tier-one universities they deserve presents a serious barrier to our future prosperity. We face many challenges head-on in this state. This is the biggest challenge of all. Face up to it, and get on with it. Thank you.",

            "content": "November 19, 2009 Washington, D.C.\n\nSometimes it helps to contemplate economic predicaments by seeking wisdom from definitively noneconomic sources. Consider this passage from Book III of Milton’s Paradise Lost, where God answers the question of why He created men and angels who could rebel against Him. Of man, He responds:\n\nAs is clear from this most celebrated work of literature, the issue of whether entities—be they mortal or divine—should be allowed to fail is one of the oldest philosophical quandaries. It has been debated for eons on a much higher plane than economics or finance. And yet Milton is germane to the subject of this conference: “Restoring Global Financial Stability.” There is no way we can reasonably expect to restore global financial stability without addressing the vexing issue of institutions considered “too big to fail.”\n\nI shall focus my comments today on this issue. I do so very much as a Lone Ranger—perhaps what you might expect from a Texan. I am merely one of the 17 who currently sit at the table for policy deliberations on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). I speak only for myself and the Dallas Fed and not for any other policymaker or division of the Federal Reserve.\n\nOnly a short while ago, we were teetering on the brink of global financial collapse. Essentially, what occurred was a crisis of unintended consequences: Misperceptions of risk and misplaced incentives led to misguided actions. The crisis metastasized in large financial institutions and spread through the entire body of the financial system. Both on and off balance sheets, banks levered up to cancerous levels and funneled funds into assets of questionable quality.\n\nThese bad bets were made worse by their scale and the rapidity with which they spread. It was not enough that one or two large institutions erroneously thought that real estate prices would rise forever—nearly all of the biggest banks did. It was not enough that one or two large institutions thought they could contract with third parties they presumed would immunize them against failure—nearly all did. And it was not enough that one or two regulators turned a blind eye to the systemic risk posed by this behavior—nearly all did, including the Federal Reserve.\n\nThis is not something new. Readers of history might recall Charles Mackay’s 1841 Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions, in which he wrote:\n\nTo which he caustically added: “Men … think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds ...”\n\nOr they might note this from Walter Bagehot’s essay on Edward Gibbon in the National Review in 1856:\n\nOr Dickens’ bon mot, where he defined insurance as:\n\nHow different things might have been if financial actors had kept the most human instincts of “love of gain” and “necessity of excitement” from leading them to become accomplices to herd-like imitation and uninsurable speculation. This behavior begat a panic where, but for the intervention of the Federal Reserve and other central banks, the entire payments system froze and brought the world economy within a hair’s breadth of depression.\n\nHaving staved off the inevitable consequence of the pathology I have just summarized, it is high time to treat the most malignant of its perpetrators—financial institutions thought to be too big to fail—as we refashion, modernize and provide needed improvements to the regulatory system.\n\nDan Tarullo from the Federal Reserve Board recently put it this way: “… the regulatory system did not come close to adequately accounting for the impact of trading, securitization, and some other capital market activities on both traditional banking and systemic risk.… The need for a thorough overhaul of the financial regulatory system is thus borne out not only by our frighteningly close brush with financial collapse … but also by the degree to which too-big-to-fail perceptions and capital-market sources of systemic risk had been permitted—if not encouraged—by regulatory developments in the preceding decades.”[3]\n\nFrom the perspective of monetary policy, I view of paramount interest an overhaul of a system that has come to coddle such “too-big-to-fail perceptions and capital-market sources of systemic risk.” My colleague Harvey Rosenblum and I explained why in the opinion section of the Wall Street Journal on September 28 in an essay titled “The Blob That Ate Monetary Policy.”\n\nWe noted that the very existence of the blob of banks considered as too big to fail blocks, or seriously undermines, the mechanisms through which monetary policy influences the economy.\n\nWhen the Fed encounters rising unemployment and slowing growth, it purchases short-term Treasury bonds, thus lowering interest rates and inducing banks to lend more and borrowers to spend more. The banking system, and the capital markets that respond to these same signals, are critical to transmitting Fed policy actions into changes in economic activity.\n\nThese links normally function fairly smoothly. Numerous academic studies have concluded that monetary policy before the financial crisis was working better, faster and more predictably than it did a few decades ago. Monetary policy’s increased effectiveness helped usher in a quarter century of unprecedented macroeconomic stability with infrequent and mild recessions and low inflation. This was perhaps the closest we have come to economic paradise.\n\nThen the Blob gummed up the works. With financial markets in trouble and the economy wobbling, the Fed began lowering its target interest rate two years ago, bringing it close to zero by December 2008. Other central banks followed suit. Based on recent experience, such aggressive policies should have returned our economy to the trajectory of stability and growth more quickly. Unfortunately, the Blob began blocking the channels monetary policy uses to influence the real economy.\n\nAs the financial crisis erupted, the largest banks, by capitalization and influence, saw their capital bases erode, and wary financial markets made them pay dearly for new capital to shore up their balance sheets.\n\nIn this environment, monetary policy’s interest-rate channel operated perversely. The real borrowing costs that matter most for the economy’s recovery—those paid by businesses and households—rose rather than fell. Those banks with the greatest toxic asset losses were the quickest to freeze or reduce their lending activity. Their borrowers faced higher interest rates and restricted access to funding when these banks raised their margins to ration the limited loans available or to reflect their own higher cost of funds as markets began to recognize the systemic risk posed by banks presumed to be too big to fail.\n\nThe credit channel also narrowed because undercapitalized banks, especially those writing off or recognizing massive losses, must shrink, not grow, their private-sector loans. Too-big-to-fail institutions account for more than half of the U.S. banking sector, and the industry is even more highly concentrated in the European Union. Small banks, most of them well capitalized, simply don’t have the capacity to offset shrinking lending activity of the behemoth banks. This problem is exacerbated by the procyclical nature of bank capital regulation, which operates on the implicit assumption that banks get into trouble one, or a couple, at a time. Bank capital regulation provides some microeconomic incentives, but destabilizing macroeconomic outcomes, when a large number of very large banks are simultaneously in trouble.\n\nThe balance-sheet channel depends on falling interest rates to push up the value of homes, stocks, bonds and other assets, creating a positive wealth effect that stimulates spending. When the financial crisis pushed interest rates and spreads perversely high, balance-sheet deleveraging took place instead, with households and businesses cutting their debt at a time when stimulative efforts were needed to prop up the macroeconomy.\n\nFalling interest rates, all else equal, usually nudge down the dollar’s value against other currencies, opening an exchange-rate channel for monetary policy that boosts exports and tempers imports. In the financial crisis, the dollar rose for about nine months relative to the euro and pound (but not the yen). This unusual behavior partly reflected higher interest rates and no doubt some “flight to quality” but probably had more to do with the perception that financial conditions at the very largest banks were worse in the U.K. and the rest of Europe than in the U.S.\n\nFinally, the troubles of mega-financial institutions interfered with the capital-market channel. In past crises, large companies had the alternative of issuing bonds when troubled banks raised rates or curtailed lending. In the past decade, however, deregulation allowed mega-banks to become major players in capital markets. The dead weight of their toxic assets diminished the capacity of markets to keep debt and equity capital flowing to businesses and scared investors away.\n\nObstructions in the monetary policy channels worsened a recession that has proven to be longer and, by many measures, more painful than any post-World War II slump. With its conventional policy tools blocked, the Fed resorted to unprecedented measures, opening new channels to bypass the blocked ones and restore the economy’s credit flows.\n\nIn summary, the Blob reduced the effectiveness of monetary policy’s transmission mechanisms. To be sure, the Fed found ways, under Ben Bernanke’s adroit leadership, to bypass those blockages by undertaking unorthodox policies. It would be dishonest of me to say that I have not supported many of the Rube Goldbergian devices we have crafted. But it would be disingenuous of me to deny that these measures carry great and unprecedented risk. They give rise to questions about the Federal Reserve’s commitment to its traditional mandate, to suspicions that we are undertaking fiscal-like initiatives and to concerns that these initiatives might compromise our independence by putting us on the road to political perdition. At a minimum, they bloat our balance sheet, requiring us to now craft and articulate an exit strategy that might take us even further from our traditional practices.\n\nIn my view, the sooner we are able to return to traditional policymaking the better. I do not believe we can do so without treating the basic pathology of too big to fail.\n\nSo I am a keen student of the various remedies that have been prescribed. They essentially break down into two camps: “learn to live with ’em” or “get rid of ’em.”\n\nThe “learn to live with ’em” camp bases its position on a presumption that we derive economic value from large firms, especially in a globalized world where businesses need transnational financial services delivered efficiently. Only this week, Josef Ackermann, the CEO of Deutsche Bank, speaking in Frankfurt, restated the argument that big banks provide “the necessary means for financing growth and innovation” because they can most efficiently provide loans and services like cash management and foreign-exchange trading for big international companies. [4]\n\nThoughtful proponents of this approach recognize that the benefits of supra-large banks—from formerly traditional banks like Citigroup to newly converted ones like Goldman Sachs—come with risks that must be corralled. According to members of this camp, that corralling may be achieved through a mixture of various tools, including:\n\nEssentially, the proponents of this approach understand the fallibility of regulatory institutions and the permeability of rules and capital requirements but believe they can be improved upon.\n\nMembers of the “get rid of ’em” school do not believe that there is any other way aside from their own to treat the moral hazard created by a too-big-to-fail culture that inculcates the privatization of gains and the socialization of losses—what some refer to as “heads I win, tails you lose.” They understand the academic and management theories that posit the benefits of size and sophistication, especially in a globally interconnected world. They also accept that banks need to invest their own capital and hedge against investments that flow naturally from their banking business. But they are wary of the distortions they believe derive from having government guarantees of deposits and other underpinnings of public trust underwrite additional risk-taking ventures such as proprietary trading.\n\nIn trying to develop my own perspective, I return to where I began this monologue: to more of Milton’s prose. The stanza from Paradise Lost that follows closely upon the one I read earlier is as follows:\n\nThe Fed, like the other regulators and the Congress that will ultimately fashion a new regulatory regime designed to treat too-big-to-fail and other problems, is far from divine. We are a worldly institution created to further the efficiency of mammon’s great agent of capitalism, what I consider to be the most effective vehicle for economic progress. I am a disciple of Schumpeterian creative destruction: I accept that, painful as it might be, destruction of errant or inefficient economic agents must occur for progress to take place in a capitalist society—that without failure there can be no good. Therefore, in the words of Milton, I would say that regulation should be designed to enable financial institutions to be “sufficient to have stood, though free to fall.”\n\nOverall, I would recommend that the treatment for too-big-to-fail be crafted with the late Irving Kristol in mind. Kristol was no Milton. Nor was he an economist. But he was nonetheless a wise man whose writings in the journal The Public Interest had an early influence on my approach to problem-solving. In writing his eulogy this past September in the New York Times, David Brooks summarized him this way: “Kristol grew up in a working-class neighborhood … and seems to have absorbed the elemental Jewish commandment: Don’t be a schmuck. Don’t fall for fantastical notions that have nothing to do with the way people really are.”[6]\n\nIt is a fantastical notion to ignore the dynamic that leads business and financial organizations to want to grow to become the biggest and the most profitable. It is a fantastical notion to assume that smart bankers will not take advantage of government guarantees to customers or creditors of one part of their business to incur risk and higher returns in another part, as long as they are allowed to do so. It is a fantastical notion to expect that the law of unintended consequences can be repealed and that mortals, be they bankers or regulators, will not henceforth miscalculate risk or take misguided actions. It is a fantastical notion to expect that having once pulled poorly run, systemically threatened firms out of the fire, government won’t do it again, no matter how many times and how loudly it says it won’t.\n\nTo craft a smart solution to this vexing problem of banks considered too big to fail requires that we deal with the way people and businesses really are. To me this means finding ways not to live with ’em and getting on with developing the least disruptive way to have them divest those parts of the “franchise,” such as proprietary trading, that place the deposit and lending function at risk and otherwise present conflicts of interest.\n\nBut we can’t stop there. Our supervisory structure must ensure that these institutions do not have the opportunity, or the incentive, to grow to too-big-to-fail status again. Activities that present risks to taxpayers must be contained using at least some of the tools proposed by the “learn to live with ’em” camp—increased capital requirements, “living wills,” “Coco” bonds and the like. We would also be well-served to roll back various pieces of the government’s safety net, forcing creditors of risky, nonbank behavior to bear the full cost of their actions. These higher requirements could act as a tax or disincentive to bigness and, if structured properly, could provide a useful brake on the dynamic that leads to reckless growth and unmanageable complexity.\n\nI know this conclusion will hardly endear me to the handful of large institutions that are commonly viewed as too big to fail. But I think it best to take a lesson from Paradise Lost and “revoke the high decree … which ordained their freedom”—for, after all, “they themselves ordained their fall.”\n\nWith that, I’ll stop. And, in the best traditional practice of central bankers, proceed to avoid answering any questions you might have.",

            "content": "November 10, 2009 Austin, Texas\n\nThank you, Tom [Granger], for that kind introduction.\n\nComing in from the airport, I again saw that fabled bumper sticker calling on local voters to “Keep Austin Weird.” It reminded me of the old saw that Washington is 10 square miles surrounded by reality.\n\nAustin might be justly proud to consider itself 272 square miles surrounded by normality. But I know better. When I made my hapless run for the U.S. Senate in 1994, I managed to visit every nook and cranny of this state. I know from personal experience that, thankfully, there is nothing normal about Texas.\n\nTake my wife’s family, for example. Her great-great grandfather was William Miles. He hailed from Nip ’n Tuck, a little town near what is now Longview in East Texas. He served gallantly in the Mexican Wars and then, after a substantial interlude, joined the 14th Regiment of the Texas Unmounted Cavalry—they had no horses but they were proud Texans and called themselves “cavalry” nonetheless—and went off to fight for the Confederacy. He had his arm shot off in battle, was discharged and sent home. To get back, he swam across the Mississippi—no small feat for a one-armed man. He is memorialized by the nickname “Sidestroke” in the family annals. Old “Sidestroke” then walked back to Nip ’n Tuck to become a dirt farmer.\n\nHe arrived home broke; he could not immediately afford a mule, so until he could, he hitched a plow to his six daughters—there was a seventh but she got smart, married a Yankee and was promptly disowned. William Miles never spent a dime; he saved every penny he earned and prospered handsomely. He died in 1910. His will instructed his executor to auction off all he had accumulated—his house, his equipment, the works—so his net worth could be calculated in hard currency.\n\nAll this is captured on his tombstone in the Gum Springs graveyard near Longview. His stone records the dates of his and his wife Nancy’s births and deaths, and the dates of his service in both the Army of the U.S.A. and the Army of Jefferson Davis. On the back of the stone, for all the world to see, are carved the words “Value of my estate $44,378.34.” That’s nearly $1 million in today’s dollars. That’s the good news. He died a rich man. The bad news is that his will required his daughters to buy everything back that was sold in his estate sale.\n\nYou cannot tell me that Austin has a corner on the market for being “weird.”\n\nInteresting as all of that is, I know you didn’t ask me to return tonight to regale you with the legends and lore of my wife’s family. You asked me here to provide insight into something even more resilient and more “weird” than William “Sidestroke” Miles—our economy. So let’s get down to business.\n\nAs you all know, the Federal Reserve’s principal monetary policymaking group, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), met last Tuesday and Wednesday. Our statement—released like clockwork at the conclusion of every FOMC meeting precisely at 1:15 p.m. Central time—summed up our collective wisdom: With a host of caveats, we noted that activity in the American economy has continued to pick up and appears to be on the mend. Despite this progress, however, we remain vigilant.\n\nLet me explain why.\n\nJust this spring, economic conditions were drastically different than they are today. We were engaged in battle against an attack that ravaged our economy on four fronts. First: a collapse in home building, the worst we’d seen since the Great Depression. Second: a reversal of wealth—the worst decline in real or nominal terms that we can find in data that begin in 1952. Third: a financial panic, complete with extreme risk aversion and a credit contraction in securities and direct credit markets. And last but not least: a bank credit crunch.\n\nA severe contraction had taken root beginning in the fall of 2008, and the Federal Reserve, as the monetary authority of the United States, was duty-bound to do everything within its power to mitigate the damage. Our task was no less than to drag the global economy abruptly and forcefully from the edge of the abyss.\n\nI believe we will be judged by history as having done so. Time will tell, of course. But this much I know: The policy actions taken by the Federal Reserve, combined with the inherent resiliency of the American economy, have helped us reverse the onslaught on three of those four fronts. Despite deterioration in nonresidential construction, the housing sector appears to be stabilizing. With regard to wealth, after plunging 24 percent in inflation-adjusted terms from mid 2007 through the first quarter of this year, net worth across all American households rose slightly in the second quarter and will likely be found to have risen in the third. And, after surging to incredibly high levels, interest rate spreads have returned to near-normalcy in the commercial paper and mortgage markets and are returning to Earth in the bond market.\n\nEfforts to free up bank credit have helped slow the pace at which banks have tightened their credit standards. The latest reports we have received from bank lending officers, released just yesterday, confirm this. However, with the lagging effects of loan quality problems, difficulties in the commercial real estate market and uncertainty over regulatory reform, a full resuscitation of bank credit has yet to take place and will take considerable time.\n\nThe progress we’ve made on each of these fronts is most certainly a welcome relief, but questions remain. Where are we headed, and when will we get there?\n\nAs we closed out the summer, I pointed out in an interview with the Dallas Morning News that there were good reasons to expect fairly strong output growth—what an economist would call “above trend growth”—in the second half of this year.[1] The reason? I like to call it the “Johnny Mercer effect,” after the great Hollywood lyricist of the 1940s: Growth follows almost automatically if you “ac-cen-chu-ate the positive and e-lim-i-nate the negative.”[2]\n\nThat’s essentially what we saw in the third quarter. Fixed investment flattened out and ceased to be a drag on the economy, eliminating an important negative from the GDP calculus. Consumer spending, which was neutral in the first half, became a strong positive. And exports and inventory investment did a 180, flipping from sources of weakness to sources of strength.[3]\n\nNow, I’ve often thought that economic forecasters seem to be cursed—or maybe blessed, I suppose, dependent upon your point-of-view—with a short-term memory: They tend to extrapolate only the most recent trends into the future. As if goosed by the more optimistic tone of the latest GDP release, many now believe that solid output growth will extend into the first half of next year. The latest Blue Chip survey, for example, shows that professional forecasters expect GDP growth averaging 2.8 percent in the first half of 2010.\n\nI am wary of the consensus view. For a good while now, I’ve suggested that we are more likely to see a more uneven recovery—not a “V”-shaped recovery but something more akin to a check mark, where the elongated arm of that check mark inclines at a slope that is less than desirable and might possibly be repressed by an occasional pause or several quarters of weak growth.\n\nWhy a check mark?\n\nSeveral recent sources of strength are likely to wane as we head into next year. Cash-for-clunkers and the first-time-homebuyer tax credit have both shifted demand forward, increasing sales today at the expense of sales tomorrow. Neither of these programs can be repeated with any real hope of achieving anywhere near the same effect: The more demand you steal from the future, the less future demand there is for you to steal. The general tax cuts and government spending increases included in this year’s fiscal stimulus package won’t have their peak impact on the level of GDP until sometime in 2010, but their peak impact on the growth of GDP has come and gone; the fiscal stimulus continues to drive GDP upward, compared with what it would otherwise have been, but the increments to GDP are beginning to shrink. And, as we all know, the shot in the arm that our economy is receiving from inventory adjustments is, while welcome, inherently transitory.\n\nWhat about growth in the longer term—the second half of 2010 and beyond? American households have finally come to realize that they’ve been playing the part of the grasshopper in Aesop’s fable: They see that our previous spending boom was financed by somewhat reckless disregard for tomorrow by over-eager creditors feeding their desire for unsustainable leveraging of their income and balance sheets and, for the nation as a whole, by increases in overseas borrowing. That reality has been largely absorbed, and consumer spending is growing again—albeit from a lower base and at a slower pace. I doubt it will recover its previous vigor for some time to come. I expect that the strong bounce-back in consumer demand that we’ve come to expect in recoveries past will be absent this time around as Americans recalibrate the proportion of their income and wealth that they need to save versus what they need to consume. We need not become a nation as parsimonious as William Miles, but we are going to have to be more ant- than grasshopper-like in our behavior.[4]\n\nWith a likely subpar showing from household spending, one other candidate as a source of growth is government spending. We should be hesitant to become overly dependent on it. As consumer credit conditions gradually improve, any boost the economy gets from growth in government purchases will increasingly be offset by reductions in household spending—people will save to meet a higher prospective tax burden.\n\nUnfortunately, this prospect of an uneven and comparatively weak recovery—in combination with excess capacity and uncertainty about the impact of new government initiatives and regulation—is taking its toll on business confidence. Firms are hesitant to add plant and equipment. In my surveys of corporate CEOs with significant capex wherewithal—a personal survey I conduct religiously before every FOMC meeting—it appears that those who are beginning to budget expanding plant and equipment are less inclined to do so here at home and more interested in doing so abroad in areas they consider to have greater risk-adjusted profit potential.\n\nMost painfully, they remain hesitant to add labor. I’m sure you all saw the headlines last Friday—despite a continuing decline in payroll losses and initial unemployment claims, the jobless rate in this country has officially reached a 26-year high of 10.2 percent, not counting those who have given up looking for work. Far fewer of you likely saw the latest numbers on labor productivity: According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics release last week, nonfarm labor productivity increased at an annualized rate of 9.5 percent in the third quarter. That is the highest quarterly increase we’ve seen in six years.\n\nWhat does this tell us? After a prolonged period of payroll growth, firms are using this downturn to reorganize and retool. To control costs and preserve margins that can cushion the top line, employers are learning to do more with less. They are squeezing all the productivity they can from their employees. You can get a snapshot of this in the recent round of earnings releases by the 453 of the S&P 500 companies that have reported third quarter performance thus far: Earnings for these companies were down 10 percent year-over-year. But top-line growth—total revenue growth—was down 14 percent. As long as this condition obtains, companies can hardly be expected to add to payrolls.\n\nThis is not surprising if you think about it. Before the crisis, we had a long period of economic expansion and easy access to money. Historically, the longer the expansion or period of prosperity, the more complacent businesses become. A growing economy, like sailing in a following sea and pleasant weather for days on end, weakens the discipline to run a tight ship. But once a storm strikes, captains of industry have no choice but to batten down the hatches and reef their sails. The more intense the storm, the longer it takes for the inefficiencies incurred during the previous expansions to recede from memory, even after fair weather returns. I would think that in this recovery period the willingness to rehire or expand capital expenditures will be long in coming. Chastised by recent experience, businesses will continue to run tight ships, with all resources, including labor, being driven to maximum efficiency.\n\nIt may be some time before significant job growth occurs and even longer before we see meaningful declines in the unemployment rate.\n\nSo we have a mixed picture for economic growth down the road, despite the pickup we’ve seen lately. What are the implications of all this for monetary policy?\n\nWith financial-market conditions normalizing—if not yet fully normal—most of the special programs that the Federal Reserve introduced last winter to backstop bank and nonbank credit have either already unwound or are rapidly doing so. For example, the special facility we put in place to revive the commercial paper market when it succumbed to paralysis last year—a facility that expanded our balance sheet by $350 billion at its peak usage level—has fallen to under $10 billion as the market has been restored. As to the longer-lived asset purchases we have made, now that mortgage-finance spreads have narrowed, our purchases of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are tapering off. We expect those transactions—which will total up to $1.25 trillion—to be executed by the end of next year’s first quarter.\n\nA legacy of MBS acquisitions is a Fed balance sheet that has more than doubled in size. This expanded balance sheet has as its counterpart a greatly elevated level of bank reserves. Banks, seeking liquidity and avoiding risk, have so far been content to let their reserves sit at the Federal Reserve, earning a modicum of interest. Ultimately, as confidence returns, these funds will be used to support an expansion in bank lending, increasing the velocity of base money in our economy. That would not necessarily be a bad thing, within limits, given all the idle resources in the economy at present. Of course, the Fed must be wary that velocity does not explode and create inflation pressures resulting from too much money chasing too few goods and services. If credit growth at some point threatens to become excessive, we have the tools to rein it in, ranging from selling the assets we have acquired so as to suck up excess money, to adjusting the rate we pay on excess reserves, to utilizing other techniques such as large-scale reverse repurchase agreements, or “repos,” to even raising the Fed funds rate.\n\nThe press and the markets are eager to know when we might undertake a tightening in policy. The answer to this question is … “It depends.” Our mandate is to pursue the maximum level of employment consistent with long-term price stability. So, when and how rapidly we reduce our accommodative policy must depend on fine judgments about how quickly the real economy gets back on track without jeopardizing our longer-run price-stability goal. As noted in our most recent statement, the FOMC will consider a variety of economic indicators—including resource slack, inflation trends and inflation expectations—when making this decision. But for the foreseeable future, the FOMC considers policy to be appropriately calibrated to the times.\n\nMy own judgment—based partly on available estimates of slack, but also on the behavior of prices, and informed by the anecdotal input I receive monthly from business leaders as to their intentions—is that inflation is likely to remain subdued for some time, and thus our current policy is appropriate. Of course, I recognize that our measures of slack and our understanding of the determinants of inflation are uncertain. And agile business leaders can change plans on a dime. Being what some believe to be the most hawkish member of the FOMC, I am very Reagan-esque in my evaluation of inflationary potential: I trust but continually seek to verify that inflation is not raising its ugly head. So, as I’ve always done, I will keep a close eye on price developments as they unfold.\n\nRight now, I see more immediate deflationary pressures than inflationary ones. Yet I am fully aware that the law of unintended consequences is always lurking in the shadows. For instance, having spent a few years early in my banking career as a foreign exchange advisor to investors and corporations, I am particularly mindful of the risks we run by stating in FOMC statements that we expect to maintain the Fed funds rate at “exceptionally low levels” for “an extended period.” This could fuel the “carry” trade, whereby speculators—assuming U.S. rates will remain unchanged over a reasonable time horizon—can borrow plentiful amounts of dollars cheaply and invest them in securities denominated in other currencies that yield more or offer greater returns, in the process driving those securities and currencies to prices beyond their equilibrium levels. Were this to become a disorderly influence, I would expect the FOMC and other authorities to craft an appropriate remedy.\n\nTom, here is the bottom line: The Federal Reserve has done what it can to prevent Depression 2.0 and the deflation that one would have expected might accompany economic collapse. It will take some time, in my opinion, to get back on a steady pathway to a pace of growth that will result in significant job creation. We are in for a long slog. We had a snapback in growth in the third quarter and can expect that will continue in the current quarter. But looking into 2010 and perhaps to 2011, the most likely outcome is for growth to be suboptimal, unemployment to remain a vexing problem and inflation to remain subdued.\n\nMind you, you should take economic forecasts—even my own—with a big grain of salt. Jamie Galbraith’s dad, John Kenneth Galbraith, may have been more right than econometricians like to think when he said that “the only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable.”\n\nNobel Prize-winning economist Kenneth Arrow has his own perspective on forecasting. During World War II, he served as a weather officer in the U.S. Army Air Corps and worked with individuals who were charged with the particularly difficult task of producing month-ahead weather forecasts. As Arrow and his team reviewed these predictions, they confirmed statistically what you and I might just as easily have guessed: The Corps’ weather forecasts were no more accurate than random rolls of a die.\n\nUnderstandably, the forecasters asked to be relieved of this seemingly futile duty. Arrow’s recollection of his superiors’ response was priceless:\n\n“The commanding general is well aware that the forecasts are no good. However, he needs them for planning purposes.”\n\nTom asked me to provide you tonight with my forecast for the economy. This evening, I have done as asked, drawing upon the models and judgment of the Federal Reserve, which are among the most complex and comprehensive in the world. But we cannot lose sight of the unfortunate fact that, despite our best efforts, no one can precisely predict the future. While we know where the economy has been and believe we understand the gearing of the economy as well as anybody can, we cannot know with certainty where it’s headed. That said, I hope my musings this evening have been better than “no good” and are of some assistance to you for your planning purposes.\n\nThank you for listening. Now, in the tradition that is hallmark of Federal Reserve officials, I would be happy to avoid answering any questions you might have.",

            "content": "October 16, 2009 Dallas, Texas\n\nThank you, President [R. Gerald] Turner.\n\nIt is common for a speaker at SMU to say how honored he is to be introduced by Gerald Turner. In my case, it is especially true. My wife’s—Nancy’s—family has been involved in SMU almost from the time Dallas Hall was the sole building on “The Hill.” Today, I am speaking in a building named for my father-in-law, the late, great Jim Collins, Class of ’37, who turned his energy to serving Dallas in the U.S. Congress after building a business: Fidelity Union Life. That business, which was sold to Allianz of Germany in the late 1970s, was the source of the funding for every facility on this campus with the name Collins or Sharp or Altshuler attached to it. Countless Collinses and Sharps and even two Fishers have been educated here. I know SMU well, and I knew Jim Collins as well as you could know any man. He would be very proud of what you have done as president of SMU and would consider you one of the greats, Gerald. And I know he would be very pleased to see his son-in-law given such a nice introduction, speaking here in the Crum Auditorium, attached to the building the university so graciously named in his honor. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nToday, you are going to hear from people who know firsthand what it means to operate a business in a globalized economy—particularly a business located in this unique part of the country, the global business nexus we call Dallas. Tom [Falk] and Rich [Templeton] are no strangers to the challenges and opportunities that await American businesses in an interconnected world, and I am confident that you all will benefit from their special insight.\n\nI’d like to speak more about the context in which global business is conducted, in order to set the stage for what I expect Tom and Rich will be saying.\n\nWe have all read the headlines and listened to the pundits’ chatter about a looming threat of “deglobalization.” A slew of armchair analysts, calling to our attention historic declines in world trade and a rise of protectionist instincts, have lamented what they believe to be an impending reversal of globalization.\n\nThis morning, I will argue that a decline in trade flows, at least to some degree, was to be expected during this tumultuous period, the most severe global financial and economic crisis in decades. I will then turn to protectionism, the bête noire of internationally minded business operators and policymakers. And then I will conclude with some comments on where we are likely to go from here, making the point that globalization is still very much alive and that, like the music of Wagner, all is not as bad as it sounds.\n\nAs usual, I will speak only for myself, not for any other member of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System. Which is fitting, for I will draw not only on my perspective as a Federal Reserve policymaker, but also on the four years I spent negotiating trade agreements for our country.\n\nLet’s begin with what the pundits have right: Our recent economic crisis has led to some truly historic declines in world trade. According to the International Monetary Fund’s most recent World Economic Outlook, global exports of goods and services, by volume, will decline over 11 percent this year, with exports of advanced economies projected to fare worse than those of their emerging and developing peers.[1] If you look to the history books, you will learn that, by some measures, the pace of international trade’s decline in the first year of this crisis was even greater than what we experienced during the Great Depression.[2]\n\nEvidence of the harsh nature of the contraction in trade we have recently experienced can be found in international shipping costs. For years, I have used the Baltic Dry Index, a price index that captures movements in the shipping market for dry bulk commodities, as one indicator of the relative health of international trade flows. In the span of less than seven months, this index took an incredible nosedive, plummeting over 94 percent by the early part of December 2008. The price data for leasing “Capesize” vessels—one of the best indicators of shipments of iron ore, a critical ingredient to the key building blocks of infrastructure worldwide—is even more volatile: They reached a peak of nearly $235,000 per day in the summer of 2008 and, since that time, have fallen over 80 percent.[3] Data for container ships, the carriers of many consumer durables, are similarly bleak, as are the data for the rails that carry goods from the ports to the distribution points of consumer outlets. And, if you’d read page C1 from today’s edition of the second-best newspaper in the world, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, you would have seen that Alliance and DFW airports—in addition to others, like San Francisco, LAX and JFK—experienced sizable cargo business declines last year (although, for DFW, relatively less than its peers).[4] While the numbers were not broken out, it is likely that at least some of that downturn could be attributed to a decline in goods shipped between international destinations.\n\nIn the blink of an eye, we went from shortage-driven inflation in transportation costs to dramatic overcapacity and slack. A little over a year and a half ago, daily lease prices of railcars in the United States were escalating rapidly; as of Oct. 1 of this year, roughly 178,000 railroad-owned freight cars, which placed end to end would total some 2,900 miles, have been laid up in storage for at least five months, according to what Matt Rose, the CEO of BNSF, recently told me. This is something of an improvement from a comparable car count for the previous month of 185,000, but it nonetheless provides a graphic indication of the enormous amount of slack in idle rail assets and the compression that had occurred in final demand for finished goods produced both domestically and abroad.\n\nThe broader, aggregate data speak to the implosion in trade that we have witnessed. As of June of this year, our quarterly imports, by volume, had fallen just over 20 percent after peaking in the third quarter of 2007. A similar measure of American exports, by volume, peaked later—as the crisis went global in the second quarter of 2008—but still managed to drop roughly 15 percent through this June.\n\nThese are just some of the doomsday figures that naysayers have highlighted to portend an onslaught of deglobalization. To be sure, these data are quite startling and, indeed, quite historic. But do they portend that deglobalization is taking root? I think not.\n\nAs most of you know, I am not a trained economist. I earned my bona fides like many of you in this room—in the world of private business, after earning an M.B.A. at Stanford: the SMU of California. That said, I have spent enough time around economists to learn two things:\n\nBefore asserting that “deglobalization” is occurring, we  must understand what has driven these global trade declines and look behind the simple headline figures and “instant analysis”—my favorite oxymoron—that accompanies the assertion of the Eeyores of punditry who claim that globalization is at risk.\n\nLet’s start by examining how the dramatic trade declines of the past year compare with what we otherwise might have expected in the midst of a global recession and whether a reversal of globalization, or maybe something else, is to blame. My colleagues at the Dallas Fed’s Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute—specifically, its director, Mark Wynne, and one of its senior economists, Jian Wang—have been doing just that.[5] I want to share some of their preliminary findings with you.\n\nFirst, a look to the dictionary: What exactly do we mean by globalization? Let me give you my CliffsNotes definition: Globalization is the process by which national borders become increasingly open to international transfers of goods, services, capital, people, ideas and a variety other economic inputs and outputs. To businessmen and women, globalization is about managing to greater efficiency by driving the costs of goods sold, expenses, inventory sourcing and management to optimization. It is also about maximizing market reach and expanding top line volume. For the business operator, globalization is a means to better profits so as to maximize returns to a company’s stakeholders. You will no doubt hear much about this from Tom and Rich.\n\nTo macroeconomists, globalization is about the integration of national markets into one global market. Fluctuations in the flows of goods and services may certainly be necessary for, or symptomatic of, such integration, but the extent to which any economy can be said to be globalized—the extent to which a domestic economy is integrated with economies elsewhere—is best judged on the basis of how close its domestic prices for various goods and services are to those on world markets.\n\nIn the presence of transportation costs, barriers to trade and so on, we can reasonably expect that there will be a difference between the domestic price of a good and the price that prevails globally. The size of this difference or distortion determines just how much of the good we will import and consume. With the removal of these barriers, that distortion will decline, domestic prices will fall and trade will increase.\n\nIt is possible for trade volumes to increase without an integration of markets. While trade growth is necessary for globalization, it is by no means sufficient. A domestic boom, for example, could leave us clamoring for all kinds of goods and services, in all price ranges, without driving down those domestic price distortions. The same could happen in reverse: A global recession that reduces import demand would likely lead to a decline in trade but might not have any effect on the wedge between domestic and international prices.\n\nThat, arguably, is largely what took place from last fall through the first half of this year. As the crisis spread from North America to the rest of the globe, the dramatic deterioration in economic prospects and the contagious seizure that afflicted financial markets in the advanced economies following the failure of Lehman Brothers last September caused the markets for emerging-market exports to dry up, engulfing them in the global downturn.\n\nAs policymakers, we would prefer to study price differentials when looking for evidence of globalization. Trade growth, again, is necessary but insufficient. And alternatively, evidence of trade decline is likely necessary, but insufficient, as evidence of that alleged multisyllable phenomenon, deglobalization.\n\nUnfortunately, we lack the reliable global price data needed to perform a more thorough analysis on that front. As such, we must move forward—cautiously—with our discussion of trade flows. If we posit that deglobalization is not the likely culprit behind the recent historic declines we have witnessed in global trade, we have to ask ourselves what other factors might be at play.\n\nWith regard to fluctuations in international trade relative to movements in the business cycle, two facts are worth mentioning. First, exports and imports are, in economists’ lingo, “procyclical.” In other words, they move in tandem with GDP. Second, swings in exports and imports are far more volatile than those of the business cycle. The average volatility, or standard deviation, of GDP is about 1.7 percent. For exports, that number is over three times greater, at 5.6 percent, and for imports, 5.2 percent.\n\nIn short, international trade flows move in the same direction as—and are a lot more volatile than—the overall economy.\n\nWhy is this the case? Despite innovations that now allow market participants to pass what we once defined as “nontradable” assets across national borders, the composition of international trade is still heavily skewed toward goods. Goods, by value, make up close to 70 and 84 percent of our exports and imports, respectively. More important, most of those goods fall into the category of “durables.” In 2008, for example, more than 60 percent of American traded-goods trade, excluding energy, was classified as durable.\n\nA durable good can be loosely thought of as anything with a relatively longer lifespan. Consumers and producers make use of these products for an extended period. As an economist might say, they provide utility over time. For a firm, this might include large manufacturing equipment. For a household, it might include a car or a refrigerator. Or, in the case of my friend and neighbor, Jerry Jones, it might include an 11,500-square-foot, flat-screen television that footballs can reach. Demand for these goods—except for in the case of Jerry, who is a unique risk taker!—is quite volatile. When the economy hits a wall, as it did last year, households postpone these larger purchases, and firms rein in previously scheduled capital expenditures.\n\nThat is what we’ve seen this year: In the final three months of 2008 and beginning of 2009—again, as the crisis went global—worldwide demand for durable goods fell substantially, registering annualized quarter-over-quarter declines in some developing nations that are well into the double digits. Given the contribution that these goods make to international trade, it should come as less of a surprise that global exports and imports dried up in the midst of the most severe global recession since World War II.\n\nThere is another reason we might expect a relatively sharper decline in trade flows during a global economic downturn—one that is tied to globalization itself. Economists call it “vertical specialization” or “internationalized production.” The other gentlemen you will hear from today might know it simply as doing business in a global world.\n\nMany goods today are manufactured in more than one place. Firms are no longer beholden to the labor and capital available within their own national borders. They can source various stages of production from anywhere in the world, using each host nation’s comparative advantage to drive down costs and expand profit margins. Whereas in previous periods, trade was composed solely of finished products, the story is now much more complex. Firms export materials to countries around the world and receive finished—or perhaps near-finished—goods that they can then sell at home or abroad or ship away for further finishing.\n\nWhen global demand takes a hit, we don’t just see a drop-off in the international exchange of finished goods. Intermediate products that multinational firms trade in this globalized production process fall by the wayside as well. Trade losses are compounded, relative to what they might have been before globalization began.\n\nAgain, it should come as no surprise, then, that as the global economy declines, trade flows decline even more.\n\nWhat has come as a surprise, however, is that the magnitude of this decline has been over and above what we might have expected based on our understanding of fundamentals.\n\nIn the past, econometric models with only two variables—American income and dollar strength—have done reasonably well explaining quarterly fluctuations in our imports. Also, and not surprisingly, models that contain foreign income and dollar strength have typically done well explaining quarterly fluctuations in American exports.\n\nUntil last fall.\n\nI am given to reminding the economists at the Dallas Fed that my undergraduate professor, John Kenneth Galbraith, used to say that economic modeling and forecasting was invented to “make astrology look respectable.” So I have asked them to dig deeper into what might have caused this breakdown. As you may recall, there was no shortage of stories in the financial media last fall about the drying up of trade finance and credit and its detrimental effect on trade flows. Given the nature of the crisis and the abundance of this anecdotal evidence, it is reasonable to assume that a severe reduction of trade finance may well have been the culprit.\n\nTrade finance is, broadly, every kind of loan, insurance policy or guarantee tied to an international good or service transaction. It includes a range of tools: from direct credit extended by an exporter to government-backed guarantees to letters of credit issued by commercial and multilateral banks and private insurers. Trade finance instruments can even act as pure risk hedges, insuring against the myriad potential problems (commercial, political and the like) that can arise in international transactions.\n\nWhile hard data on trade-specific finance are difficult to obtain, there are a few quantifiable measures we can point to as evidence of a drying up of this important trade tool. Since the summer of 2007, private capital coming into and out of the U.S. has plunged. In the span of one year, these flows fell from 15 percent of our GDP to zero. Declines in trade credit were similarly dramatic. The contraction in trade credit available, for example, to Korean firms in the fourth quarter of last year was the most severe since the Asian crisis of the late 1990s. And for Brazilian firms, the contraction was more severe than during the real devaluation crisis in the early part of this decade.\n\nWhen a global flight to quality takes hold—something we’ve witnessed to a startling degree during this financial crisis—we might expect that investors, banks and firms would limit their exposure to relatively risky nations. Surprisingly, though, emerging markets were not the only victims. Firms in the U.S., Japan and Germany, for instance, also saw record drops—literally unprecedented at the end of last year—in trade credit liabilities.\n\nThe subject of trade finance is very much on the front burner in the debate on the need for a new regulatory regime governing financial institutions. Had you read page 4 of yesterday’s Financial Times, you would have seen an intriguing article discussing the accounting treatment of trade credit and an assertion that the “shortage of trade finance [during the financial crisis] was responsible for more than 10–15 percent of the fall [in global trade].” It went on to say that “… bankers warn that a diminished capacity for trade-related lending could create bottlenecks that will slow or stop the recovery.”[6]\n\nHere is the point: The dramatic turndown in trade we have witnessed was the result not of some invidious plan to undo globalization. It resulted from a turndown in the domestic gearing of the world’s larger economies, which spread to the emerging economies that feed into demand from those larger economies, and it was exacerbated by the financial crisis, including a clampdown in trade credit.\n\nThis does not mean globalization is being undone. It does not mean that “deglobalization” has begun.\n\nThat said, we must remain ever vigilant to forces that we know can undo the good that has come from globalization. The biggest threat of all is the political instinct when times are tough to embrace protectionism.\n\nToday, protectionism is more subtle than in the past. Governments no longer have to resort to explicit tariffs and quotas to stave off the inflow of foreign goods and services. They can be more creative. At the Dallas Fed, we commonly watch indicators released by the World Trade Organization such as antidumping investigations. While these numbers are still well within the experience of the past decade, their increase throughout 2008 and in the first half of 2009 is not something we can simply ignore.\n\nOne cannot be too blunt about the dangers of protectionism. It is, quite frankly, the crack cocaine of economics: It may provide politicians with a temporary high, yet it is instantly addictive and inevitably proves debilitating and fatal for an economy. We must keep a watchful eye on quick fixes—like the imposition of tariffs on affordable Chinese tires—to make sure this dangerous instinct does not get out of hand. We cannot forget that what made the Great Depression “great” or the even worse 23-year “Long Depression” that closed out the 19th century “long,” was the onslaught of protectionist measures enacted by a host of countries around the world. We would be well-served to remember that lesson.\n\nHaving said all that, I must tell you, as a former trade representative, I am encouraged by recent developments on the trade front. For example, we hear little these days from Sen. Schumer and Sen. Graham (or even the Secretary of the Treasury) about the need to take punitive actions in retribution for what they consider insufficient flexibility in the exchange rate of the Chinese currency. While I disagree, from a free-trader’s perspective, on the Section 421 action taken on Chinese tires—an action that only hurts lower-income groups in the U.S. who buy those cheaper tires—I assume, without any more knowledge than what I learned about the way things operated when I was a trade representative during the second term of the Clinton administration, that the current administration undertook that action as an inexpensive way to placate an important constituency and that there might have been far more expensive alternatives on the table. And I take heart that while Congress has not seen fit to act on the U.S.–Korea Free Trade Agreement—an agreement I have long championed—it has at least been agreed to between negotiating parties and has occasioned an agreement between Korea and the European Union that was initialed yesterday (and modeled in-fact on the Korea–U.S. agreement).\n\nWhile I doubt the practicability of letting the G-20 or the IMF become global regulatory forums or rule-making bodies that trump sovereign authorities of their member nations, I also take heart that at least these forums are being used proactively to discuss common problems and keep the momentum for positive financial reform and continued trade liberalization moving forward. That momentum could have easily gone into reverse under the difficult global financial and economic conditions that have obtained.\n\nThis does not mean that those who believe, as I do, that a more fully interconnected, globalized economy leads to the most efficient allocation of resources (which in turn leads to a more productive, efficient and prosperous environment for American businesses) should let down their guard. It does mean that we have cause for optimism. Globalization is proceeding. That’s the good news. And nobody is in better position to exploit it and make it work to the benefit of their stakeholders than Dallas-based businesses.\n\nThank you. And now, in the best tradition of central banking, I would be happy to avoid answering any questions you might have.",

While housing is showing some signs of having reached a bottom, we need to recognize that it is a sector still on life support. The Federal Reserve has been buying over 70 percent of the new mortgage originations in the MBS market—a process that has lowered mortgage rates and increased the availability of credit at affordable rates to a large swath of the market. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has announced its intention to slow its rate of mortgage acquisitions in the hope that private funding will begin to emerge. And the market for the purchase of new homes has also been helped tremendously by an $8,000 credit for new home buyers.\n\nOf course, there is some concern that the hope for a housing rebound could succumb to the headwinds experienced earlier if the efforts of fiscal and monetary authorities are allowed expire. Yet, that said, there is, in my opinion, a limit to the life support that can be provided by either the Federal Reserve on the monetary front or the Congress on the fiscal front. The market for housing will not become truly robust until market forces replace the prostheses of government support. We have thus indicated to the marketplace that, for our part, the FOMC expects we will complete the execution of our $1.25 trillion intervention in the mortgage-backed securities market by the end of the first quarter of next year.\n\n* * *\n\nAs to the long-term dangers of inflation posed by the expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, I remain ever vigilant. I have not hesitated in the past to vote against the majority of the FOMC when I felt they were being too accommodative, and I have been outspoken on the dangers of prolonged monetary stimulus in the future. Many of the Fed’s special credit facilities have been winding down at a rapid clip as financial markets have begun to function in a more normal manner. And my colleagues have come to accept the arguments I made regarding the necessity for the Fed to maintain its independence from the Treasury by not increasing its purchases of long-term Treasury securities. As to the Federal Reserve reducing its balance sheet so as not to monetize the excess reserves waiting to be converted to bank loans, I have been very clear: Given the lag between the time monetary policy is initiated and when it impacts the economy, that wind-down process needs to begin as soon as there are convincing signs that economic growth is gaining traction and that the lending capacity of the banking system is capable of expansion.\n\nI am not alone on this front. I have faith my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee will stand and deliver in a timely way. And I expect that when it comes time to tighten monetary policy, my colleagues and I will move with an alacrity that, if needed, will be equal in speed and intensity to that with which we pursued monetary accommodation.",

            "content": "September 29, 2009 Dallas, Texas\n\nThank you, Ralph [Babb] for that kind introduction.\n\nA little over a year ago, the nation was staring straight into the jaws of economic ruin. The Federal Reserve stepped into the breach and did what central bankers are called to do: We assumed the role of lender of last resort, enacting a sequel to the playbook written by the Bank of England over 180 years ago following the Panic of 1825. We opened the flood gates and lent freely, instituting unconventional measures to keep the financial lungs of the global economy from collapsing.\n\nIn doing so, we took enormous risk with our reputation and with our balance sheet, expanding it from north of $800 billion before the crisis to $2 trillion today. We knew full well that this would lead to a gnashing of teeth about the long-term consequences of our actions, not the least of which is the potential for all the money we have pumped into the economy to spark an inflationary conflagration once its gears start to mesh again.\n\nI am going to talk to you today, first, about where the economy and inflation now stand and then say a few words about the opportunities that lie before us as Texans as we move on down the road.\n\nThe long and short of it is that there are presently some signs that the economy is stabilizing and even reviving in certain areas, despite mixed signals. Financial markets are continuing to improve; household spending is stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth and tight credit; businesses are making progress in aligning inventories, though sales are still anemic and CEOs are continuing to cut back on fixed investment and payrolls. Given both the monetary accommodation we at the Fed have put in place and the stimulus of fiscal policy, it is now reasonable to expect a gradual resumption of economic growth in a context of price stability.\n\nThe operative words in that sentence were \"gradual\" and \"in a context of price stability.\" So, just what are the prospects for economic growth? And what is the outlook for prices?\n\nFor the past four years, I have personally surveyed 30 or more chief executives of key companies in a broad array of sectors before every Federal Open Market Committee meeting in order to get a read on how they are positioning their enterprises.\n\nThese operators of our economy—private-sector operators whose teams decide what to purchase, what to produce and how many workers are needed to turn inputs into products and sales—are still suffering from shock induced by the trauma of the crisis. I would say they are suffering from \"post-traumatic slack syndrome.\"\n\nUntil the summer of last year, businesses were emboldened by a prolonged period of ready money and robust global demand. They were geared toward the expansion of plant, equipment and payrolls. At the same time, inflationary pressures were building. Businesses took every measure possible to boost their top lines by passing on rising costs through higher prices. As we entered the summer of 2008, the inflation data exhibited frightful tendencies. Of the 178 items in the consumer's basket used to measure PCE, 77 percent were rising, and the number rising above 3 percent per annum was the highest we had seen in nearly two decades.\n\nThere are limits to the costs that can reasonably be passed on to consumers without damaging top-line revenue performance. Thus, simultaneously, businesses worked like beavers to preserve their bottom lines by controlling the costs of goods and services they sold, shifting their management models and budgeting accordingly.\n\nThen they experienced a traumatic shock. Demand imploded. The equity and fixed-income markets seized up. Bank credit evaporated. The growth of the global economy hit a wall. Whereas just over a year ago managers were coping with a pervasive scarcity of inputs and escalating prices, there is now an abundance of almost every input and output and no pricing power. There are too many ships at sea; too many rail cars; too many airplanes and trucks; too many homes; too many hotels and apartments and office buildings; too many retail stores and malls and convenience stores; too much oil, natural gas and corn; and, according to Wall Street Journal reports last week, even too much champagne and bottled water.[1]\n\nAnd yes, thank you Lord, we have finally come to realize there are too many lawyers.\n\nIn almost every sector of the economy—save for nonelective medical services and a few basic commodities being hoarded by the Chinese—the CEOs I survey are struggling to cope with excess capacity and slack.\n\nBusinesses trying to sell products and services feel they are pushing on a string and are adjusting their behavior accordingly. To maintain sales volumes and clear inventories in the face of weakened demand, they are cutting prices. In the fourth quarter of last year, we began to see an upward shift in the number of items falling, rather than rising, in price. In the July data recently released, almost 50 percent of the items in the PCE basket—weighted either by simple count or expenditure—were falling in price. Small wonder that headline inflation was negative over the year ended in June.\n\nAnd top lines have evaporated. In this most recent quarter, for example, the 376 nonfinancial companies in the S&P 500 reported a nearly 20 percent decline in top-line revenues. This is the third sales decline in a row—the first time we have seen this since 1965.\n\nThe new numbers tell me two things. First, for the immediate future, the risk to price stability is a deflationary risk, not an inflationary one. And second, businesses will continue to run tight budgets as they try to preserve profit margins while operating in the absence of pricing power with the pervasive difficulty of expanding top-line revenues in the face of weak demand. They will continue to focus on cost control, most painfully by shedding workers and driving those who remain on the payroll to higher levels of productivity.\n\nAll of which means that we are likely to see a prolonged period of sluggish economic performance and uncomfortably high unemployment as businesses reallocate capital and labor to fit the new economic landscape.\n\nThe needed reallocation of labor and capital has been, and will continue to be, impeded by financial markets. Although substantially improved from last fall—due in significant part, I would argue, to the work of the Federal Reserve—markets are still a long way from having normalized. We know from our own experience and from the experience of other countries that financial headwinds like these take years to abate.\n\nTo offset those headwinds, fiscal authorities have stepped forcefully into the breach, putting in place a massive stimulus effort. They have done so with the intent of limiting the damage to disposable income from unprecedented declines in wage and salary income—while trying to goose up capital expenditures on infrastructure.\n\nIf you go back to the rudimentary formula taught in high school economics to account for the makeup of GDP—consumption plus investment plus government expenditures plus net exports—the \"G,\" or government, variable is receiving enormous emphasis, while \"C\" is flaccid, \"I\" is hesitant and net \"X\" is tentative. At the present rate, federal, state and local authorities are expected to spend, net of intragovernmental transfers, $5.4 trillion in 2009—just under 40 percent of expected GDP.\n\nThe problem is that government stabilization measures come with a real long-term price tag: higher tax rates, greater national indebtedness and the prospect of higher interest rates and the debasement of the dollar driven by the government's issuance of massive amounts of debt. These long-term costs of a larger government limit the American people's willingness to rely on the public sector to drive overall economic growth. A fiscal gag reflex ensues, and the public-sector option looks less and less attractive as anything other than a temporary source of growth.\n\nThe major challenge facing U.S. fiscal authorities is meeting the need for near-term economic stimulus while pursuing a practicable plan to stabilize the government's debt-finance obligations. The secretary of the Treasury is doing his level best to reassure investors—both overseas and here at home—that the programs put in place by the Obama administration and the Congress will work their magic and then be gradually withdrawn as the economy gets back into stride. But this is no simple task. It is now common knowledge that deficits are growing at $3 million per minute and will accumulate to some $9.1 trillion over the next decade. And our fiscal predicament is compounded by the embedded unfunded liabilities of Social Security and Medicare. By our calculation at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, the present value of the unfunded debt of these two entitlement programs has reached $104 trillion, with $88.9 trillion of that due to Medicare alone.\n\nThe legendary actor Errol Flynn is reported to have quipped that his problem lay in \"reconciling [his] gross habits with [his] net income.\" I imagine the American public and its representatives are close to their limit of tolerance of the \"gross habits\" of government and the net new indebtedness they are willing to pass on to their children, all of which suggests that, as an antidote to what ails the economy, government spending is a thin reed on which to rely. Given the expected slow adjustment rate of the other components of final demand, my guess is it will be a long time before we see growth strong enough and sustained enough to make an appreciable dent in excess capacity. I envision an output path going forward from here that looks something like a check mark, with a near-term snapback from the short, intense downstroke we have experienced, followed by a transition to a long period of slower growth corresponding to the elongated side of the mark.\n\nMind you, one of my college professors was John Kenneth Galbraith, who warned his students that \"the only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable.\" My forecast for the economy might be totally wrong. But that is how I see it as a Piscean, and I'm sticking with it.\n\nAs to the long-term dangers of inflation posed by the expansion of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, I remain ever vigilant. I have been outspoken on the reduced need for monetary stimulus in the future. Many of the Fed's special credit facilities have been winding down at a rapid clip as financial markets have begun to function in a more normal manner. And I have been outspoken on the necessity for the Fed to maintain its independence from the Treasury by not increasing its purchases of long-term Treasury securities. As to the Federal Reserve reducing its balance sheet so as not to monetize the excess reserves waiting to be converted to bank loans to the private sector, I have been very clear: Given the lag between the time monetary policy is initiated and when it impacts the economy, that wind-down process needs to begin as soon as there are convincing signs that economic growth is gaining traction and that the lending capacity of the banking system is capable of expansion. Cynics retort that \"the Fed may know what to do—but will it have the guts to pull the trigger?\" Well, we Texans are not afraid to pull the trigger (as anybody knows who has gone duck hunting with vice presidents of the United States!). I have faith my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee will stand and deliver in a timely way.\n\nRecently, a book titled In Fed We Trust: Ben Bernanke's War on the Great Panic, written by the Wall Street Journal's David Wessel, was released. In it, he describes me as one of the \"jocks\" on the Federal Open Market Committee who is \"determined to show [his] manhood by talking tough about inflation and economic rectitude.…\"[2] He's got that right. I am proud of it. I am paid to be a compulsive worrier preoccupied with price stability and monetary integrity, and I aim to earn my pay.\n\nThe Fed does not pay me to promote Dallas and Texas. But I do anyway.\n\nI am grateful beyond belief that Ray Hunt, who was then chairman of the Dallas Fed board, brought me home from eight years in Washington to be president and CEO of the Dallas Fed. I loved being an ambassador; I loved negotiating for my country. But you know what they say. \"Washington is 10 square miles, surrounded by reality; Washington is Hollywood for ugly people; Washington is a place where a friend is someone who stabs you in the chest.\" These are exaggerations. But I do feel blessed to be able to work on national policy at this amazing juncture in economic history with the brilliant staff of the Dallas Fed and live among genuine people who are hard headed, pro-business, unafraid of competition, no-nonsense and hardly enamored with the heavy hand of government. They give me the perspective and moral support I need to make the arguments I do at that big mahogany table where the Federal Open Market Committee meets.\n\nIt is a great source of pride to me that in 2007, Texas created almost 30 percent of all the private sector jobs in the nation. I delight in the fact that my Federal Reserve District was the only one in the country that created jobs in 2008. Imagine that: While the nation lost over 3 million jobs in 2008 as the peanut butter hit the fan, we managed to create 63,100 jobs in Texas.\n\nIt is true that our job-creating machine rolled over in the early fall, and we entered a recession like the rest of the country. And yes, my staff projects that we will have up to 212,000 jobs lost in Texas this year. That hurts: Roughly one of every 50 people in this room has already lost or will lose his or her job this year. My expectation, however, is that the cut is going to be less deep here and require fewer stitches than elsewhere. I expect that we will come out of the recession chute not only quicker but stronger than many other parts of the country.\n\nWhy? Because we have the right stuff. If you didn't see it, you should read and re-read the Economist magazine's cover article and special section on Texas in the July 11 issue—this little baby right here. It cites many things that are music to my ears. For example, it points out that Chief Executive magazine ranks Texas as the best state in which to conduct business. It goes on to say that Texas, and I quote, \"has coped well with the recession, with an unemployment rate two points below the national average and one of the lowest rates of housing repossession … [and its] banks … did not overexpand...\" (no doubt due to great regulatory oversight by the Dallas Fed!). Texas, it concludes, \"offers a different model [than the rest of the states], based on small government … no state capital-gains or income tax, and a business-friendly and immigrant-tolerant attitude.\"[3]\n\nThe magazine is balanced; it also points out our weaknesses—primarily a lack of Tier 1 universities and the potential for a repetition of California's woes as the demography of our state changes. But it makes a clear argument that Texas has the potential to be the crucible of the future of the United States.\n\nThis wasn't written by the governor's economic development office. It was written by unbiased parties in one of the most respected journals in the world. I suggest to this chamber that they take this and every piece of propaganda we can garner and immediately put it in the hands of every CEO and leading academic in the country—in Michigan (where Ralph and Comerica moved from) and in California and New York and every other place that has run aground on the shoals of the Great Recession—and proactively go out and incent them to pull up their stakes wherever they are and replant them in this great city and state. We need to strike now and press our comparative advantage to secure the future prosperity of our children and their children and their children after that.\n\nYou ought to pursue this mission with the same kind of enthusiasm and vigor you always have in fulfilling your mission here in the North Dallas Chamber. What you have done with this group and all your other efforts for the greater Dallas area have made and continue to make a huge difference.\n\nI consider chambers of commerce to be the Marine Corps of the economic community of any city.\n\nYou remember what Ronald Reagan said about the Marines: \"Some people spend an entire lifetime wondering if they have made a difference. The Marines don't have that problem.\" Dallasites don't have that problem. Texans don't have that problem. If we can just harness the spirit and devotion that is in this room and spread it city- and statewide, our future will never be in doubt and we will, indeed, inspire the nation.\n\nThanks for listening. Now, in the best tradition of the Federal Reserve, I'll do my best to avoid answering your questions.",

            "content": "September 3, 2009 University of California, Santa Barbara\n\nThank you, Professor [Peter] Rupert. I am grateful to you and especially to our mutual friend, Finn Kydland, for inviting me to speak at this magnificent university tonight under the auspices of the Laboratory for Aggregate Economics and Finance.\n\nIf I may, before starting my speech, I would like to say a few words about Finn. I am half Norwegian: My mother descends from the seafaring Andersen clan of Sandefjord, a former whaling town roughly 400 kilometers east of the farmlands of Jaeren, where Finn was born. You can’t have a trace of Norwegian blood and not be proud of Finn. Only 11 Norwegians have ever won a Nobel Prize, and only six have done so in my lifetime. Three of those were prizes in economics.\n\nWhich brings to mind the old saw that there are three kinds of economists—those who can count and those who can’t.\n\nFinn can count. And reason clearly. And teach, patiently and lucidly. He has been of great help to us at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas in improving our understanding of time inconsistency and the business cycle. And he honors us by serving on the advisory board of the Dallas Fed’s Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute. I am most thankful to Finn for his contributions to economics, to the Federal Reserve and to Norwegian pride.\n\nNow to the subject at hand.\n\nAs Professor Rupert mentioned, my wife Nancy and I are bibliophiles. We collect rare books. This is an expensive hobby that began when I wrote a paper as a student at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business on the imperfect auction market for out-of-print first editions. As you might guess, the recent financial crisis has ratified much of what I wrote about over 30 years ago, and that, as Peter mentioned, is what enabled my recent bargain-priced purchase of the original Oxford English Dictionary and a near-mint-condition 1841 printing of Mackay’s Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions, a book I recommend to anybody who wants to understand the pathology behind the recent—and any other—financial crisis.\n\nOur interest in books led us to serve on a committee that advises the Library of Congress. It was through the library that we were introduced to the country singer Dolly Parton. Most people think of Dolly as the caricature of Marx’s—Groucho’s, not Karl’s—swarmy quip: “She has eyes that folks adore so, and a torso even more so.” But Ms. Parton has a prodigious brain for music and business—and a passion for books. She has done a great deal for education—her foundation now gives out, free of charge, over 6 million books a year to pre-K children in more than 40 states, the District of Columbia, Canada and the United Kingdom to start them on the road to reading.\n\nWhat does this have to do with the economy? Well, in thinking about what I wanted to say tonight, I was reminded about an incident that occurred when Ms. Parton was given the Library of Congress’ Living Legend medal for her contributions to American culture. At dinner afterward, a rather indignant woman, offended by Ms. Parton’s … topography, thought to diminish her by noting how disproportionately small her feet seemed to be. Dolly’s saucy riposte was a classic: “Well, you know, sweetie, it is very hard to grow anything in the shade.”\n\nTonight, I wish to speak of the difficulty of growing our economy in the shade of an abundance of excess capacity for the production of goods and services worldwide.\n\nThe Present Situation\n\nYou will have read in this morning’s newspapers of the minutes released yesterday of the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee meeting of Aug. 11–12 and the conclusions drawn at that meeting regarding the status of the economy. The collective sense of our group was that the economy was leveling out. We noted that conditions in financial markets were continuing to improve; household spending was stabilizing but remained constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth and tight credit; and businesses were making progress in aligning inventories with still-anemic sales and were continuing to cut back on fixed investment and payrolls. The committee concluded, given both the monetary accommodation we had put in place and fiscal policy, that it was reasonable to expect a gradual resumption of economic growth in a context of price stability.\n\nThe operative words in that sentence were “gradual” and “in a context of price stability.” Just what are the prospects for economic growth? And what is the outlook for prices?\n\nIn explaining how the economy will transition from recession to recovery, we at the Dallas Fed have been referring lately to “the Johnny Mercer effect,” after the Hollywood lyricist who penned the refrain “Ac-cent-chuate the positive [and] e-lim-i-nate the negative.”\n\nHere is how it works. Residential investment, inventory investment and consumer spending together account for 3 percentage points of the 3.9-percentage-point decline in real gross domestic product (GDP) that we’ve seen over the past four quarters. So, if we eliminate these negatives, we go a long way toward stabilizing the economy.\n\nThe latest monthly indicators suggest that the drag from residential investment has stopped. Indeed, our latest estimate is that residential investment will add roughly half of 1 percentage point to GDP growth in the current quarter. Inventory investment is likely to remain negative, but as long as it does not become even more negative, it will cease to be a drag on GDP growth. And if the pace of inventory liquidation moderates, you eliminate a powerful negative and begin to accentuate the positive.\n\nConsumption, the most prominent of all GDP components, has suffered its biggest four-quarter drop since 1951.[1] But, as Milton Friedman taught us, households adjust their spending levels quickly as the economic outlook changes, without waiting for the changes to be realized. In other words, they cut their spending as job prospects deteriorate rather than wait for layoffs to actually occur. This means that the worst may well be over for household consumption, barring some new shock. We certainly do not expect American consumers to come surging back to fuel a global boom any time soon, but the latest data on personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and retail sales are broadly consistent with Friedman’s theory. Real household spending rose for the third month in a row in July and is up 0.6 percent (not annualized) so far this year, though some of this growth undoubtedly reflects the cash-for-clunkers program, which has now expired.\n\nIn a similar vein, the latest report from the Institute for Supply Management shows export orders swinging into positive territory as the economies of our overseas trading partners begin to turn around. Again, we have a reversal of signs and the elimination of a negative: Falling exports subtracted 1.9 percentage points from GDP growth over the past four quarters. Nonresidential fixed investment has been an even larger drag on the economy, subtracting 2.4 percentage points from GDP growth. But, as with consumption, the latest monthly indicators suggest a bottoming out and hint at the beginnings of a modest expansion.\n\nMeanwhile, government stimulus spending is kicking into gear, accentuating a positive: Government purchases added 1.3 percentage points to GDP growth last quarter, up almost 1 percentage point from the average of the previous three quarters.\n\nThe point is: A lot of former negatives are being eliminated or even turned into positives. Former positives, like government purchases, are being accentuated. The combination is beginning to propel the economy upward.\n\nThe question is: How robust and sustainable will the recovery be?\n\nInventory adjustments, while welcome, are of temporary utility. Any boost to growth we receive as firms achieve control of their inventories will be the result of a rebalancing of supply and demand that is inherently transitory. Sustained growth will have to come from somewhere else.\n\nI doubt it will come from housing or a return to the bad old days of financial Bacchanalia. We do not want—and cannot expect—massive foreign capital inflows or domestic investment indifferent to risk to finance another boom in household spending and residential investment. That means we will need to see a massive reallocation of capital and labor away from such formerly hot growth areas as construction and finance. This reallocation will be impeded by financial markets that—while improving—continue to operate at less-than-full efficiency. I surmise that the re-gearing will take time and that, in the interim, households and businesses will focus on shoring up their savings and balance sheets rather than spending money. For consumption, that translates into a slow crawl out of purgatory. For capital expenditures and employment rolls, it means an emphasis on tight budgeting and a continued focus on absolute needs rather than wants.\n\nFor the past four years, I have personally surveyed 30 or more chief executives of key companies in a broad array of sectors before every Federal Open Market Committee meeting to get a read on how they are positioning their enterprises.\n\nThese operators of our economy—private-sector operators whose teams decide what to purchase, what to produce and how many workers are needed to turn inputs into products and sales—are still suffering from shock induced by the trauma of the crisis. I would say they are suffering from “post-traumatic slack syndrome.”\n\nUntil the summer of last year, businesses were emboldened by a prolonged period of ready money and robust global demand. They were geared toward the expansion of plants, equipment and payrolls. At the same time, inflationary pressures were building. Businesses took every measure possible to boost their top lines by passing on rising costs through higher prices. As we entered the summer of 2008, the inflation data exhibited frightful tendencies. Of the 178 items in the consumer’s basket used to measure PCE, 77 percent were rising, and the number rising above 3 percent per annum was the highest we had seen in nearly two decades.\n\nThere are limits to the costs that can reasonably be passed on to consumers without damaging top-line revenue performance. Thus, simultaneously, businesses worked like beavers to preserve their bottom lines by controlling the costs of goods and services they sold, shifting their management models and budgeting accordingly.\n\nThen they experienced a traumatic shock. Demand imploded. The equity and fixed-income markets seized up. Bank credit evaporated. The growth of the global economy hit a wall. Whereas just over a year ago managers were coping with a pervasive scarcity of inputs and escalating prices, there is now an abundance of almost every input and output and no pricing power. There are too many ships at sea; too many rail cars; too many airplanes and trucks; too many homes; too many hotels and apartments and office buildings; too many retail stores and malls and convenience stores; too much oil, natural gas and corn; and, according to Wall Street Journal reports this week, even too much champagne and bottled water.[2]\n\nAnd yes, thank you Lord, we have finally come to realize there are too many lawyers.\n\nIn almost every sector of the economy—save for nonelective medical services and a few basic commodities being hoarded by the Chinese—the CEOs I survey are struggling to cope with excess capacity and slack.\n\nBusinesses trying to sell products and services feel they are pushing on a string and are adjusting their behavior accordingly. To maintain sales volumes and clear inventories in the face of weakened demand, they are cutting prices. Beginning in the fourth quarter of last year, we began to see an upward shift in the number of items falling, rather than rising, in price. In the July data just released, almost 50 percent of the items in the PCE basket—weighted either by simple count or expenditure—were falling in price. Small wonder that headline inflation was negative over the year ended in June: This is the first time since 1955 that we have seen deflation.\n\nAnd top lines have evaporated. In this most recent quarter, for example, the 376 nonfinancial companies in the S&P 500 reported a nearly 20 percent decline in top-line revenues. This is the third sales decline in a row—the first time we have seen this since 1965.\n\nEvaluating the Numbers\n\nThe new numbers tell me two things. First, for the immediate future, the risk to price stability is a deflationary risk, not an inflationary one. And second, given they are operating in the shadow of the absence of pricing power and the pervasive difficulty of expanding top-line revenues in the face of weak demand, businesses will continue to run tight budgets as they try to preserve profit margins. They will continue to focus on cost control, most painfully by shedding workers and driving those who remain on the payroll to higher levels of productivity.\n\nAll of which means that we are likely to see a prolonged period of sluggish economic performance and uncomfortably high unemployment as businesses reallocate capital and labor to fit the new economic landscape.\n\nThe needed reallocation of labor and capital has been, and will continue to be, impeded by financial markets. Although substantially improved from last fall—due in significant part, I would argue, to the work of the Federal Reserve—markets are still a long way from having normalized. We know from our own experience and from the experience of other countries that financial headwinds like these take years to abate.\n\nTo offset those headwinds, fiscal authorities have stepped forcefully into the breach, putting in place a massive stimulus effort. They have done so with the intent of limiting the damage to disposable income from unprecedented declines in wage and salary income—while trying to goose up capital expenditures on infrastructure.\n\nIf you go back to the rudimentary formula taught in high school economics to account for the makeup of GDP—consumption plus investment plus government expenditures plus net exports—the “G,” or government, variable is receiving enormous emphasis, while “C” is flaccid, “I” is hesitant and net “X” is tentative. At the present rate, federal, state and local authorities are expected to spend, net of intragovernmental transfers, $5.4 trillion in 2009—just under 40 percent of expected GDP.\n\nThe problem is that government stabilization measures come with a real long-term price tag: higher tax rates, greater national indebtedness and the prospect of higher interest rates driven by the government’s issuance of debt. These long-term costs of a larger government limit the American people’s willingness to rely on the public sector to drive overall economic growth. A fiscal gag reflex ensues, and the public-sector option looks less and less attractive as anything other than a temporary source of growth.\n\nThe major challenge facing U.S. fiscal authorities is meeting the need for near-term economic stimulus while pursuing a practicable plan to stabilize the government’s debt-finance obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury is doing his level best to reassure investors—both overseas and here at home—that the programs put in place by the Obama administration will work their magic and then be gradually withdrawn as the economy gets back into stride. But this is no simple task. It is now common knowledge that deficits are growing at $3 million per minute and will accumulate to some $9.1 trillion over the next decade. And our fiscal predicament is compounded by the embedded unfunded liabilities of Social Security and Medicare. By our calculation at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, the present value of the unfunded debt of these two entitlement programs has reached $104 trillion, with $88.9 trillion of that due to Medicare alone.\n\nThe legendary actor Errol Flynn is reported to have quipped that his problem lay in “reconciling [his] gross habits with [his] net income.” I imagine the American public and its representatives are close to their limit of tolerance of the “gross habits” of government and the net new indebtedness they are willing to pass on to their children, all of which suggests that, as an antidote to what ails the economy, government spending is a thin reed on which to rely. Given the expected slow adjustment rate of the other components of final demand, my guess is it will be a long time before we see growth strong enough and sustained enough to make an appreciable dent in excess capacity. I envision an output path going forward from here that looks something like a check mark, with the Johnny Mercer effect giving us a near-term snapback from the short, intense downstroke, followed by a transition to a long period of slower growth corresponding to the elongated side of the mark.\n\nNow, mind you, this is what I foresee from my vantage point, standing before you tonight. Yet well before I met Finn Kydland or could afford to collect rare books or was taught economics by Dolly Parton, I took an undergraduate course from John Kenneth Galbraith. Galbraith warned his students that “[T]he only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable.” My forecast for the economy might be totally wrong. But that is how I see it as a Piscean, and I’m sticking with it.\n\nPeter, thank you. I would now be happy to avoid answering any questions the audience might have.",

            "content": "July 23, 2009 Carlsbad, California\n\nIn his upcoming book, In Fed We Trust: Ben Bernanke’s War on the Great Panic, David Wessel of the Wall Street Journal writes that “Fed officials are the Jewish mothers of the global economy. They always have to worry about something …”[1] He also organizes the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) into “cool guys,” “jocks,” “geeks” and “wannabes.” I am classified as one of the “jocks” who, according to Wessel, are “determined to show their manhood by talking tough about inflation and economic rectitude.”[2] So this morning, you are going to hear from a compulsive worrier preoccupied with price stability and monetary integrity.\n\nIf you had turned to page 2 of the Wall Street Journal on Monday, you would have seen a felicitous headline that read, “Fed’s Lending Ebbs as Crisis Subsides.” The leading indicators for June that were released on Monday by the Conference Board do, indeed, hint at a crisis subsiding: The index rose for the third straight month and, in doing so, has registered gains comparable to those seen last in the economic recoveries of 1991 and 2001–02. The index reflected recent increases in residential building permits, a modest increase in the manufacturing workweek, a retreat in initial jobless claims and slight improvement in supplier deliveries. Taken together with other, recent economic data releases, these movements might be viewed as signaling improving conditions in manufacturing and distribution. As to the Fed’s lending, had you suffered through my last few speeches, you would have heard me say that the Federal Reserve had pulled the economy back from the abyss as I reviewed the success of the temporary programs we put in place to revive the functioning of the key credit markets.[3]\n\nThe Journal is right: Our lending from these facilities has ebbed. To update you: At last count, our holdings of commercial paper had been reduced from $350 billion at its peak to $111 billion; the primary dealer credit facility has gone untapped for 10 weeks; overseas central bank borrowing under the swap arrangements we put together at the end of 2007 and significantly expanded afterward is running at a fifth of its peak rate. The term asset-backed securities loan facility, or TALF (which some wags said was too clever by HALF), is still growing but comprises a very small proportion of the Fed’s emergency lending portfolio. And the term auction facility, or TAF—the very first facility we created in December of 2007 to auction significant amounts of discount window credit to primary-credit-eligible depository institutions—is running an average daily balance that is almost half the rate it reached during the fourth quarter of 2008.\n\nSo what’s to worry about?\n\nWell, central bankers always find things to worry over—we are genetically programmed that way. Today I’ll speak of two concerns. The first is the longer-term outlook for the economy. The second has to do with the separate but related problem of the concentration of financial power in the hands of too few institutions and the pathology of too-big-to-fail.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nThe outlook for real activity over the next several quarters is improving. While there is considerable angst regarding the problem of growing unemployment, which in the troughs of the last two recessions was a painful and politically evocative lagging indicator, there are clear signs that the economy is stabilizing and even reviving in critical areas. The mathematics of stabilization is interesting. One of my colleagues at the Dallas Fed calls it “the Johnny Mercer effect,” after the famous Hollywood lyricist who penned the refrain “Ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive [and] e-lim-i-nate the negative.”\n\nHere is how it works. Residential investment, inventory investment and consumer spending each subtracted more than a percentage point from GDP growth, on average, during the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009 (the latest periods for which we have data). The latest monthly indicators suggest that the drag from residential investment has stopped and may even be reversing. Inventory investment is likely to remain negative, but as long as it does not become more negative, it will cease to be a drag on GDP growth. And if the pace of inventory liquidation moderates, you eliminate a powerful negative and begin to accentuate the positive.\n\nAs to consumption, the most prominent of all GDP components: With the exception of the episode in the spring of 1980 when President Carter imposed credit controls, consumption has suffered its biggest two-quarter drop since records began in 1947. But, as Milton Friedman taught us, households adjust the level of their spending quickly as the economic outlook changes, without waiting for the changes to be realized. In other words, they cut their spending as job prospects deteriorate rather than wait for layoffs to actually occur. This means that the worst may well be over for household consumption, barring new bad news. While we do not expect American consumers to come surging back to fuel a global boom any time soon, latest data on personal consumption expenditures and retail sales appear consistent with Friedman’s theory.\n\nIn a similar vein, the latest reports from the Institute for Supply Management show export orders stabilizing as the economies of our overseas trading partners begin to bottom out. Again, we have a reversal of signs and mitigation—if not elimination—of the negative: Falling exports subtracted 3.8 percentage points from GDP growth over fourth quarter 2008 and first quarter 2009. Nonresidential fixed investment was nearly as large a drag: 3.6 percentage points. But, as with residential investment, the latest monthly indicators suggest at least a bottoming out and, hopefully, even the beginnings of a rebound.\n\nMeanwhile, government stimulus spending is about to kick in, turning a 0.2-percentage-point drag on GDP growth into a significant plus.\n\nA lot of former negatives are being eliminated. We are seeing changes from negative impulses to slightly positive ones. This accentuates the positive in the aggregate. We probably have the beginnings of a faint recovery.\n\nHow robust and sustainable will the recovery be? There’s the rub—the stuff of concern.\n\nInventory adjustments, while welcome, are of temporary utility. Any boost to growth from inventory investment will be the result of a rebalancing of supply and demand that is inherently transitory. Sustained growth will have to come from somewhere else.\n\nI doubt it will come from housing or a return to the bad old days of financial Bacchanalia. We do not want—and cannot expect—massive foreign capital inflows or domestic investment indifferent to risk to finance another boom in household spending and residential investment. That means we will need to see a massive reallocation of capital and labor away from such formerly hot growth areas as construction and finance. I surmise that this regearing will take time and that, in the interim, households and businesses will focus on shoring up their savings and balance sheets rather than spending money. For consumption, that translates into a slow crawl out of purgatory. For capital expenditures and employment rolls, it means an emphasis on tight budgeting and continued focus on absolute needs rather than wants.\n\nThe needed reallocation of labor and capital has been and will continue to be impeded by financial markets. Although substantially improved from last fall—due in significant part, I would argue, to the work of the Federal Reserve—markets are still a long way from having normalized. We know from our own experience and from the experience of other countries that financial headwinds like these take years to abate.\n\nTo offset those headwinds, the fiscal authorities have stepped forcefully into the breach, putting in place a massive stimulus effort. They have done so to prevent unprecedented year-over-year declines in wage and salary income from translating into falling disposable income—while simultaneously trying to goose up capital expenditures on infrastructure.\n\nIf you go back to the rudimentary formula taught in high school economics to account for the makeup of GDP—consumption plus investment plus government expenditures plus net exports—the “G,” or government, variable is receiving enormous emphasis while “C” is flaccid, “I” is hesitant and net “X” is tentative. At the present rate of government expenditures thus far this year, federal, state and local authorities—net of intragovernmental transfers—are expected to spend $5.6 trillion in 2009, equivalent to 40 percent of expected GDP.\n\nThe problem is that government stabilization measures almost certainly come with a real long-term price tag: higher tax rates, greater collective indebtedness and the prospect of higher interest rates driven by the government’s issuance of debt. These long-term costs of a larger government put a limit on the American people’s willingness to rely on the public sector to drive growth in the overall economy. A fiscal gag reflex ensues, and the public-sector option looks less and less attractive as anything other than a temporary source of growth.\n\nThe major challenge facing U.S. fiscal authorities is meeting the need for near-term economic stimulus while simultaneously pursuing a practicable plan to stabilize the government’s debt-finance obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury is doing his level best to reassure investors—both overseas and here at home—that the programs put in place by the Obama administration will work their magic and then be gradually withdrawn as the economy gets back into stride. He will, incidentally, have to square his corners with the Congressional Budget Office, which estimates that annual deficits will stay above at least $600 billion a year over the next decade and will require an addition of $9.1 trillion in debt.\n\nErrol Flynn is reported to have quipped that his problem lay in “reconciling [his] gross habits with [his] net income.” I imagine the American public and its representatives are close to their limit of tolerance of the gross “habits” of government and the net new indebtedness they are willing to pass on to their children, all of which means to me that reliance on government spending as an antidote to what ails the economy is a thin reed to rest on. Given the expected slow adjustment rate of the other variables that make for sustainable economic growth, my guess is it will be a long time until we reach a point when that growth will carry on at rates to which we had become accustomed. I envision an economic path forward from here that looks something like a check mark, with the Johnny Mercer effect giving us a snap back as the negative momentum of the short, intense down stroke of the check mark abates and turns upward but then settles into a lower growth slope on the elongated side of the mark.\n\nMind you, one of my professors at Harvard was John Kenneth Galbraith, who warned us that “economic forecasting was created to make astrology look respectable.” I might be totally wrong here. But that is how I see it presently from my perch at the Dallas Fed: Economic growth is likely to be slower in the out years than we have become accustomed to.\n\nThe challenge for the Federal Reserve is to provide needed near-term monetary stimulus while maintaining a credible commitment to long-term price stability. This means (a) distinctly avoiding any perception that we are willing to monetize this or any other administration’s fiscal initiatives, and (b) providing the marketplace with a clear sense of how we will unwind in a timely manner the stop-gap measures that have resulted in a dramatic expansion of our balance sheet.\n\nI want to return to the chart on page 2 of Monday’s Wall Street Journal. While the temporary liquidity programs I mentioned earlier have retracted, our balance sheet has expanded due to the increase in our holdings of securities held outright. Here are the numbers for the past year through last week: The Fed has taken onto its consolidated balance sheet $205 billion in Treasury securities, $102 billion in the debt of Federal agencies and $526 billion in mortgage-backed securities. We presently carry a total of $1.3 trillion in securities held outright, accounting for roughly 63 percent of our total assets.[4] When the Fed acquires securities, the funds enter the banking system and ultimately appear in the reserve accounts held at the Fed by banks and other financial institutions. When these reserves are removed from our balance sheet and lent out to the public, expansion in the money supply and easier credit conditions could ultimately result in inflationary pressures. Mindful of this, concerned parties have asked what our “exit strategy” will be.\n\nChairman Bernanke provided what I thought was a fulsome exposition of our exit arsenal in his semiannual Humphrey–Hawkins testimony (the CliffsNotes version of his presentation was made available in an op-ed in the Journal on Tuesday).[5] He detailed the means by which the FOMC can either directly reduce the stock of reserves or temper the incentive for banks to deploy them into the economy by making it attractive for banks to keep them on deposit at the Fed through higher interest rate payments. We could also drain reserves and excess liquidity by arranging large-scale reverse repurchase agreements (reverse repos), have the Treasury sell bills to the public to sop up money in the system and place the proceeds on deposit at the Fed and, if necessary, sell outright into the market some of the longer-term securities we hold on the left side of our balance sheet.\n\nI will say no more about this here today; I think the chairman has covered the waterfront on this subject. But I will acknowledge that, yes, to pull the credit markets out of a death spiral, we have taken great risk with the Federal Reserve balance sheet. We never contemplated doing more than the minimum necessary. And we know that we can do too much. For example, while one can argue that by agreeing to purchase up to $300 billion in long-term U.S. Treasuries, the FOMC provided a needed short-term tonic to private credit markets, we dare not come to be viewed as a handmaiden to the Treasury. By loosening the anchor we have established for long-term inflation expectations, we could create the perception that monetary policy is subject to political imperatives, doing lasting damage to our ability to maintain price stability and restore full employment. I believe we have come as close as we dare to the line between acceptable and unacceptable risk in this regard, and do not personally wish for us to expand or extend our purchases of Treasuries beyond the cumulative $300 billion planned by this fall.\n\nTo conclude this little diversion on exit strategy, let me say that I am aware some will argue that laying out our arsenal is not enough; we need to convince markets we have the nerve to deploy it in a timely fashion. Within minutes of the conclusion of the chairman’s testimony, one commentator sent out a client note, later echoed by many others on op-ed pages and on the web, as follows: We now “know the Fed has the bullets, but fear it will not have the guts to pull the trigger.” To a Texan who lives in a gun culture, this is a cute analogy (especially coming from someone who’s Swiss!). But I would not doubt our resolve. We know full well that monetary policy trickles in with a lag and that we will have to “pull the trigger” of tightening policy well before it is politically convenient.\n\nToo Big to Fail\n\nFiscal and monetary authorities today face the additional, special challenge of reforming financial regulation so as to minimize the chances of a future meltdown. Here, again, there is a tension between the short term and the long term. In the short term, once a financial crisis has begun to develop, the natural focus is on limiting the damage—on preventing contagion. A real danger is that in the longer term, the prospect of these government damage-control efforts will lead financial institutions to take inappropriate risks, making the financial sector even more dysfunctional.\n\nThe financial crisis has had some important consequences for the structure of the banking industry—indeed, the financial industry as a whole. We saw the investment banking model largely disappear as some of the major players—Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley—converted to bank holding companies, while some others—Merrill Lynch, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers—are no longer with us. The restructurings that have taken place have certainly altered the shape of the U.S. banking industry.\n\nA major concern of mine is that all the crisis-related acquisitions we have seen may further consolidate financial assets and power into the hands of a few large organizations, leading ultimately to reduced competition and a less diverse and efficient financial sector. The massive government assistance recently provided to large banks may be artificially tilting the competitive balance in favor of large institutions.\n\nFor example, each of the four largest commercial banking organizations, and others as well, was provided with substantial government assistance during the crisis—all, at least implicitly, in the name of the too-big-to-fail doctrine. As a group, the total asset base of the four has grown 30 percent since June 2007.[6] In contrast, industry assets outside the four have grown a smaller 12 percent.\n\nThat growth reflects acquisitions. Bank of America’s assets grew 51 percent from June 2007 to March 2009, assisted in no small part by its acquisitions of Countrywide Financial and Merrill. Wells Fargo’s asset base grew 138 percent, thanks mainly to its acquisition of Wachovia. J.P. Morgan Chase acquired both Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual and grew 43 percent.\n\nThe only institution among the top four that did not grow is Citigroup, whose assets declined almost 20 percent. And here’s an interesting observation: Rough estimates suggest the top four institutions together would have shrunk—not just Citigroup—if not for the acquisitions just mentioned. Taking out the acquired assets, the current top four likely would have shrunk 7 percent as a group over the period in question.\n\nThe acquisitions of troubled banks have worked to perpetuate size concentration in the banking industry. The top four currently control 44 percent of industry assets. If we simply take away from the top four the assets they recently acquired, they would have “only” 30 percent of the industry’s asset base.\n\nIn using acquisitions to resolve the crisis, we may have unwittingly perpetuated one of its root causes—the too-big-to-fail doctrine.\n\nThoughtful critics will point out that too-big-to-fail is economically perverse: There is something inherently anticapitalistic when you have a system that allows banks, their shareholders and creditors to profit when things go well but leaves the taxpayer holding the bag when things turn sour.\n\nThe economist Allan Meltzer likes to say that “capitalism without failure is like religion without sin: It doesn’t work.” In order to have a financial system that remains the fountainhead of credit and the wherewithal for business men and women to bring forth new ideas and products and create employment, we must have a dynamic system that rewards winners rather than coddles losers, that incentivizes prudent behavior and harshly penalizes imprudent behavior.\n\nMy colleague Gary Stern—the outgoing president of the Minneapolis Fed who literally wrote the book on TBTF (too big to fail)—recently gave a speech that pulled no punches on this front. He said (a) “it is striking that most of the losses suffered to date during the financial crisis have been at the largest institutions operating in the country,” (b) the problem of too-big-to-fail was “not … addressed effectively by the FDICIA legislation of 1991 [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act]” and (c) “creditors of such [large] complex financial institutions expected, on the basis of relatively well-established precedents and on an understanding of policymakers’ motivations, protection if failure threatened.”[7] Thus incentivized, management of these institutions took excessive risk, and the market underpriced that risk. And it follows in President Stern’s mind, as it does in mine, that unless incentives are focused upon in seeking to cure the problem of TBTF, we will not only fail to address this most troublesome pathology but may make it worse.\n\nStern argues that the Treasury proposal now on the table to correct the problem “fails” in regard to corralling incentives for managers of large institutions to repeat the errors for which the public has recently paid so dearly. Here is his punch line: “I would describe the Treasury plan … as ‘status quo plus’—[with] more capital, more liquidity, better supervision, [and] far-reaching resolution authority for the largest institutions. [But] [t]here is little reason to think that these steps will … succeed in reining in TBTF effectively over time because they do not change the incentives which create the problem. In fact,’’ Stern concludes, “there is nothing in the Treasury proposal designed to put creditors of large, systemically important financial institutions at risk of loss. … [T]he Treasury proposal … leaves the financial system considerably more vulnerable …”[8]\n\nAs we grapple with TBTF and with the overall regulatory treatment of so-called Tier 1 institutions, we are going to have to bear Gary Stern’s criticism in mind. The only way to ensure a robust financial system is to enforce a system that marries risk-taking to consequences and see to it that the consequences for mismanagement are loss of managerial positions and the capital of shareholders and creditors, including uninsured depositors, rather than a second chance that only further concentrates financial power.\n\nThis is important—not only to ensure a more efficient economic system but to better facilitate the implementation of monetary policy. The extent and duration of the extraordinary steps taken by those of us at the Fed are complicated by the prolonged existence of financial institutions that fall into this troublesome category.\n\nBanks that are too big to fail exacerbate business and credit cycles. In the good times, these institutions use excessive leverage and their cost-of-funds advantage to grow more rapidly than smaller banks. Expansionary monetary policy is then given a boost as these institutions grow at eye-popping rates.\n\nBut what happens when financial conditions worsen? Too-big-to-fail banks must de-lever, shrinking their asset books and, in general, swimming against the tide of easier monetary policy. As the weak capital position of these institutions becomes widely recognized, they find it difficult and costly to raise funds. A weakened financial system with several of these banks will induce a flight to quality, increasing credit spreads and interest rates at a time when the Fed is attempting to do just the opposite. This slows economic growth, reducing asset values and overall wealth as credit availability deteriorates further. An adverse-feedback loop is created, working in direct opposition to the policy efforts of the central bank.\n\nThe existence of financial institutions that are too big to fail dramatically impacts the transmission mechanisms of monetary policy. The blockages they create—in credit markets and on balance sheets throughout the economy—compound our travails by making it more difficult to get the timing and dosage of monetary policy “right.” They reduce the effectiveness of our traditional tools, introducing a need for special liquidity and credit facilities that are difficult to unwind.\n\nI know my opinions on this subject will hardly endear me to the largest financial institutions. On his death bed, Voltaire (who was neither a Hollywood lyricist nor a movie actor nor the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis) was asked to renounce the devil. He is said to have replied that this was no time for making new enemies. Some think that during this time of crisis and with financial and economic recovery still so tenuous, it is not the right time to think about proposals that make the perfect the enemy of the good. I disagree. I believe we need to “think long,” as the Californian George Shultz likes to say, and the current policy prescription for treatment of TBTF is a bit shortsighted or, at best, necessary but not sufficient. If we want to avoid a repeat of what has just happened over the past 18 months, we need to exorcise the notion that an institution is too big to fail and remove all incentives for any institution to risk infecting the health of the financial system. If we make some enemies in the process, so be it. The object is to get it right.\n\nThank you. I would be happy to avoid answering any questions you might have.",

            "content": "May 28, 2009 Washington, D.C.\n\nI want to thank the Washington Association of Money Managers for having me here this evening and Fred Boos for that kind introduction. Thank you also for allowing two of my best friends, Evan Thomas and the Reverend Derrick Harkins, to join me tonight.\n\nNeither Evan nor Derrick is a money manager. Evan is editor-at-large of Newsweek and is one of the great American nonfiction writers. He wrote The Wise Men and one of the great biographies of Bobby Kennedy. Yet, as an Annapolis man, I love him best for his work on John Paul Jones—the father of the American Navy. But that is not why he is here tonight. We are \"cousins\" through marriage: Both he and my wife, Nancy, descend from the family tree of Norman Thomas, a Presbyterian minister who ran for the presidency six times as a socialist and pacifist. Evan is here because in a most nonpacifist manner, he plans to dispatch with me on the golf course this weekend and wants to make amends ex ante.\n\nI shall appeal to Reverend Harkins for some ex ante divine intervention in Saturday's match! Derrick leads the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church and has been my pastor for many years, going back to when he led the New Hope Baptist Church in Dallas. He is one of our country's most eloquent preachers, and I am honored that he is here.\n\nWith such a distinguished man of the cloth present among this group of people dedicated to the pursuit of mammon, I thought I would give a little sermonette this evening.\n\nHere are four quotes from financial scripture:\n\nThe first is from Charles Mackay's Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions, written in 1841:\n\nThe second is taken from the father of central banking—Walter Bagehot—from his essay \"Edward Gibbon,\" in the 1856 edition of National Review:\n\nFrom Liaquat Ahamed, who has written a superbly entertaining book, published earlier this year, titled Lords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the World:\n\nFinally, Paul Volcker as quoted in Bill Neikirk's Volcker: Portrait of the Money Man in 1987:\n\nTonight, I will reference each of those passages as we explore where we have been, where we are today and the fiscal predicament that awaits us further down the road. But first, some context.\n\nReverend Harkins will no doubt have heard the story of the humble Presbyterian pastor who visited a shelter where he found a man who looked particularly downtrodden. This generous pastor took pity upon the man. He took him to a barber for a shave and a haircut and to a store for a pair of shoes, a shirt, a tie and a new suit. The pastor then dropped the man back at the shelter, handed him $20 and told him, \"Son, you have been saved. My church is just one block away from here. I want you to come to my church on Sunday and praise the Lord.\"\n\nSunday came but the man did not. So immediately after the service, the pastor went to the shelter. There was the man, sitting in a rocking chair, all dressed up and beautifully groomed, reading a newspaper. \"Son, I had asked you to come to my church this morning to give testimony to having been saved. Where were you?\" asked the pastor.\n\n\"Pastor,\" the man replied, \"I surely did go to church. I woke up this morning, shaved my whiskers, combed my hair, put on this beautiful shirt and tie you bought me and dressed in this new suit. I put on these fancy new shoes. When I looked in the mirror, I felt like a millionaire. So I used the $20 to take a cab to the Episcopal church.\"\n\nI certainly don't need to tell a room full of Washington money managers what got the nation into its current economic situation. A sudden new set of circumstances, easy money seemingly heaven-sent and the short-sighted suspension of time-tested, prudent financial practice led us on the road, not to salvation, but to economic perdition.\n\nThe new set of circumstances included the economic and financial windfalls that came from at least two major structural changes. The first was the end of the Cold War and the commercial reorientation of China, Vietnam, India and Eastern Europe, which unleashed enormous new capacity for the increased production of goods and services, held down costs and restructured the global economic map. The second was the explosion of computational power and communication ease that came from technological advancement and the Internet, facilitating globalization and leapfrogging frontiers that formerly separated the economic landscape. The world was our oyster. It simultaneously gave us new consumers and suppliers. It provided new sources of funds as well as new places to invest.\n\nEasy money may well have been encouraged by central banks that held interest rates too low for too long. But it was exacerbated by lenders, investors and consumers who—keen on enhancing returns that seemed pedestrian with a flat yield curve anchored by low, risk-free rates—\"craved\" and \"devoured\" new risk instruments, to paraphrase Bagehot. As a result, they came up with new \"schemes\" and \"projects\" and \"phantasies\" made more enticing by expanded markets and financial innovation.\n\nShort-sightedness was manifest in the abandonment of prudential practices. For the banker and lender, the time-tested principle of \"know your customer\" took a back seat to the mad rush to package and sell exposure to others. For the consumer, \"living within your means\" became a less compelling discipline in a world where a house was not just a home but a means to financial gain. For the investor, prudence took on another dimension with the presumed ability to mathematize judgment and hedge away the risk of default.\n\nAnd yet, while the world had indeed changed, the behavioral pathology documented by Mackay and Bagehot in the 19th century—a pathology based on their studies of countless debacles through history—prevailed. A \"plethora\" of commercial and financial opportunity begat \"speculative\" excess that inevitably begat a \"panic.\" The thundering \"herd,\" spurred on by \"the love of gain, the necessity of excitement or mere force of imitation\" and \"mad\" with irrational exuberance for the upside, suddenly realized in 2008 it had \"devoured\" more risk than it could stomach and panicked. The financial system seized up and the economy descended into recession.\n\nWho is to blame? Well, if you had been listening to the radio on Feb. 26, 1933, you would know the answer. You would have heard a crazed Father Charles Coughlin, pastor of the Shrine of the Little Flower in Royal Oak, Mich., rail against \"the Morgans, the Kuhn-Loebs, the Rothschilds, the Dillon-Reads, the Federal Reserve banksters, the Mitchells[1] and the rest of the undeserving group, who without … the blood of patriotism … flowing in their veins have shackled the lives of men and of nations with the ponderous links of their golden chain.\"\n\nAdvance the tape 76 years. If you substitute Goldman Sachs for the Rothschilds, Lehman Brothers for Kuhn-Loeb, AIG for Dillon Read, Ken Lewis or John Thain for \"Sunshine Charlie\" Mitchell and keep the text about Federal Reserve \"banksters,\" you will have captured the liturgy of invective heard from Father Coughlin's contemporary secular cousins. Nothing is new under the sun; old prejudices and conspiracy theories never die.[2] On airwaves and in the blogosphere, on editorial pages and even in the halls of Congress and foreign parliaments, critics are casting about for whom to blame for \"shackl(ing) the lives of men\" and women from Bethesda to Beijing with the \"ponderous links\" that took us to the very edge of the abyss of global economic collapse.\n\nI will let you draw your own conclusions about who is to blame. In my time at the Federal Reserve, starting in 2005 and working predominantly under the chairmanship of Ben Bernanke, my colleagues and I have been focused primarily on finding a way to undo past errors and mend the system.\n\nI believe that the initiatives taken by the Federal Reserve prevented us from falling into the chasm of an economic depression. Beginning in August of 2007, we confronted a total breakdown of the financial system. Having announced our extension of term lending to banks in December, in rapid order, we then set in motion a series of steps to provide liquidity, strengthen the security of certain banks, become the equivalent of market maker for key financial instruments such as commercial paper and certain asset-backed securities and, in ways appropriate to the times, deliver on our mandate as lender of last resort.\n\nYou are all familiar with the efforts taken by the Federal Reserve to these ends. I won't review them program by program this evening. I think it fair to say that with these actions the Federal Reserve has done everything in its power to avoid making the modern equivalent of the \"misjudgments\" that Liaquat Ahamed argues were made by our predecessors in the 1930s (and, I should add parenthetically, that everyone and their brother feel Japan made in the 1990s).\n\nThere is evidence that our actions have succeeded in pulling the financial markets and the economy from the edge of the abyss. There are, as many have noted, some \"green shoots\" beginning to sprout that will help end the contraction in output and set the stage for a recovery. This is not to be Pollyannaish or imply that these sprouts are spreading like kudzu. But the knock-on effect of the Fed's direct efforts does seem to have reignited animal spirits in markets that had been frozen. The commercial paper market has been revived. Mortgage rates have declined significantly. Issuance of corporate bonds has become robust. The premium over Treasuries that investment-grade corporations pay to borrow in the open market has fallen by more than 35 percent since peaking last December. The same can be said of higher risk bonds as well as jumbo mortgages—all markets considered to be at the far end of the risk spectrum. This round-trip back from last fall's unprecedented flight to quality is also reflected in the stock market, as equity markets have coursed upward and volatility has diminished.\n\nWhile it takes some time for these improved financial conditions to start helping the broad economy, I am pleased to see a reaction on Main Street: The most recent reports indicate that purchasing managers see an abatement in the pace of decline in new orders; manufacturers surveyed by the Kansas City, Philadelphia, Richmond and Dallas Feds, to varying degrees, report a moderation in their previous rates of decline in activity;[3] retail sales are no longer plunging; and, as all of you heard from the Conference Board on Tuesday, consumers' assessment of the economy over the next six months—driven primarily by slowing job losses—appears to be less pessimistic.\n\nThese are encouraging signs. But, to be sure, we are not out of the woods. We have miles to go before we sleep.\n\nCompared with the fourth quarter of last year, first quarter results for the nation's largest banks are encouraging, yet obvious challenges remain. Confidence among business women and men—the creators of lasting, productive jobs and prosperity—has shown signs of revival but remains elusive. Consumers at home remain cautious, for fear of losing their homes or their jobs. The markets we sell into abroad—Mexico and Europe, for example—remain strikingly weak, while others such as China are perhaps more robust but are insufficiently sized to fill the hole left by consumers at home and in our larger export markets.[4]\n\nUnder these conditions, I have been forecasting a slow recovery. Not a V-shaped snapback—nor even a U-shaped one—but a very slow slog as we find a more sensible and sustainable mix between consumption, savings and investment. It is worth recalling that employment did not reach its nadir until 21 months after the end of the 2001 recession, though headwinds then were not nearly as severe as those we face today.\n\nYou know the numbers that have been reported for the nation for the first quarter: Even after upcoming revisions, I venture we will find we contracted at somewhere between an annualized 5 and 6 percent. The pace of decline will moderate in the current quarter, and then we are likely to bounce along the bottom for a while. I would be delighted, but surprised, if meaningful sustained growth gets under way before the end of the year. Regardless, increases in unemployment, while mitigated by the expansion of government (particularly the need for census takers), will likely take us to a 10 percent jobless rate before we reverse course. And global excess capacity is likely to remain excessive for some time to come.\n\nAs to price stability—the touchstone of central banking—given the vast amount of slack worldwide, the near-term outlook for inflation is meek. Indeed, the recent pressures have been to the deflationary side. As evidenced in the Dallas Fed's most recent manufacturing survey, firms receiving lower prices for their goods outnumbered those receiving higher prices 11-to-1, although firms do expect deflationary pressures to begin subsiding.[5]\n\nNeither deflation nor inflation engenders confidence. Both distort the decisionmaking of households as well as businesses. Both inhibit sustainable employment growth. If you want to know the outlook for inflation over the next quarter or next year, look at current domestic and global slack: It is doubtful that inflation will raise its ugly head until employment and capacity utilization tighten. Looking further out, however, Milton Friedman—who, in keeping with the theme of this evening, I suppose I could safely refer to as the Moses of monetary policy—reminds us that inflation, defined as \"a steady and sustained rise in prices,\" is \"always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.\"[6] Bearing this in mind, we must be careful with the deployment of our monetary initiatives.\n\nAs the nation's central bank, the Fed performs two major roles, in addition to its regulatory duties. One is the standard conduct of monetary policy—a blunt instrument of adjusting interest rates and the money supply to achieve our long-term objectives of price stability and sustainable employment.\n\nThe Fed's other role is, as mentioned, to act as a lender of last resort—to stabilize financial markets when confidence breaks down and markets become unduly segmented and dysfunctional. This entails targeted injections of liquidity to keep markets functioning under dire circumstances. Reflecting the larger role of securities markets in funding loans, the Federal Reserve has extended its lender of last resort role beyond banks. Since the fall of 2007, the Federal Reserve has been aggressive in putting programs in place to revive the functioning of key credit markets and pull the economy away from the brink. I point to the term auction (TAF) and commercial paper (CPFF) facilities as examples of initiatives that have worked as planned by the FOMC and are now shrinking in size. These actions are not permanent injections of money that may later fuel inflation, but rather are temporary injections of liquidity to stabilize malfunctioning markets. As such, they are intended to promote financial stability, sustainable growth and price stability.\n\nCongress, spurred on by the new president, has been aggressive with fiscal policy. The good news is that if fiscal policy has been properly designed—and time will tell if it has been—it should propel the economy farther away from the edge and put it on its way to a new cycle of economic growth, somewhat tentatively at first but hopefully gathering momentum as time passes.\n\nUnfortunately, that momentum faces a real, long-term threat: storm clouds on the horizon in the form of daunting fiscal imbalances.\n\nThat deficits will be high over the next few years seems clear, with a $1.8 trillion deficit expected this year and $3.8 trillion in new debt issuance now forecast over the next five years. Perhaps more important, annual deficits exceeding half a trillion dollars are projected for at least 10 years into the future, emphasizing that we as a nation will continue to spend considerably more than we take in long after the current economic crisis.\n\nThe country's major newspapers recently reported with great urgency the administration's finding that Social Security would begin spending more than it takes in by 2016—seven short years from now. Left unreported was the fact that the discounted present value of entitlement debt, over the infinite horizon, reached $104 trillion.[7] This is almost eight times the annual gross domestic product of the United States—and almost 20 times the size of the debt our government is expected to accumulate between 2009 and 2014.\n\nMost of this entitlement shortfall comes from Medicare rather than Social Security. As you may know, Medicare has three main components: Part A for hospital stays, Part B for doctor visits and Part D for prescription drugs. The fiscal shortfall for Part A alone is $36.4 trillion—about one third of all entitlement debt. Part B's shortfall is just a tad larger, clocking in at $37 trillion. Part D—the latest addition to the Medicare program—registers a shortfall of $15.5 trillion. And Social Security, the program about which various reforms have been so frequently mooted in recent years, registers a deficit of $15.1 trillion—only one seventh of the total unfunded liability from entitlement programs.\n\nThis is the fiscal predicament to which I alluded earlier—a looming budgetary threat to our long-term economic prosperity. And while the announcement that the Social Security trust fund will begin its decline one year earlier is an important fiscal event, the swelling of overall entitlement debt to more than one hundred trillion dollars has far more serious implications for economic growth—implications we are poorly positioned to address given the budget deficits we face today.\n\nOur successor generations are coming to grips with this daunting reality. Faced with the prospect of a government that they believe may be unable to deliver on its promise of long-term fiscal balance—particularly with regard to entitlement programs—these individuals might logically begin to alter their consumption patterns, spending less today to save more for tomorrow. There is nothing wrong with increasing savings. But, in an economy driven by consumption, this intertemporal hedging may dampen the pace of future economic growth.\n\nOf course, any student of history knows that throughout time, governments unwilling to face the music and fund their liabilities have turned to monetary authorities to print their way out of their predicament. We all know by heart the pathologies that afflicted Weimar Germany, Argentina and other countries. And we have daily reminders from bond vigilantes like Bill Gross about the prospect of losing our AAA rating. This cannot be allowed to happen in America. Which is why I am pleased to see that the new administration has embraced what was hitherto perceived as the third rail of American politics and brought the issue of unfunded entitlement liabilities to the fore. For the sake of our grandchildren, I hope that the administration and the Congress will take this vexing beast of a problem by the horns and tame it.\n\nAgainst that background, it is important that monetary policymakers be especially sensitive to concerns voiced about the dramatic expansion of the Fed's balance sheet in an era of high deficits. I return to the Book of Ahamed and the Book of Volcker. Ahamed speaks of the miscalculations of policymakers. Volcker warns that the Fed cannot monetize deficits without heightening fears of inflation and negatively impacting the future course of interest rates.\n\nThose of us responsible for developing monetary policy must constantly bear both observations in mind. We have been very careful to calibrate our actions so as to accommodate the needs of credit markets and the economy—not political imperatives. We are well aware that some of our balance sheet additions, designed to pull markets and the economy from the edge, have raised a few eyebrows (like the $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities we have pledged to purchase if necessary—although it has unquestionably driven mortgage rates to historic lows). And while it is not unusual for the System Open Market Account to buy Treasuries along the yield curve, the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) decision to purchase $300 billion in U.S. Treasuries—a decision made to improve the tone in private credit markets—has been viewed by some as skating a little too close to the edge of political accommodation.\n\nI can tell you that the FOMC is well aware of the doubts being voiced about its intentions. I can also tell you that nobody I know on the committee wants to maintain our current posture for any longer and to any greater degree than is minimally necessary to restore the efficacy of the credit markets and buttress economic recovery without inflationary consequences. Indeed, as I speak, we are studying ways to unwind our balance sheet in a timely way.\n\nIn the meantime, looming before us is the prospect of a heavy calendar of debt issuance by the Treasury. Between now and the end of the current fiscal year in October, the Treasury will issue just over $1 trillion in net new debt, with at least that much to follow in fiscal 2010. As the Book of Volcker warns, the Federal Open Market Committee can ill afford to be perceived as monetizing debt, lest we come to be viewed as an agent of, rather than an independent guardian against, future inflation and drive real interest rates higher.\n\nYou may wish to note that, press and analysts' reports to the contrary, a keen student of the H.4.1 and the Foreign and International Monetary Authority (FIMA) custody holdings reports of the Fed will detect that foreign official holdings of U.S. Treasuries and agencies have been growing at a robust pace, not shrinking. And from what I can detect from the activity of so-called indirect bidders in Treasury auctions—indirect bidders submit competitive bids through others rather than directly; central banks are among those who commonly bid indirectly—there continues to be strong demand for longer duration Treasuries—again, contrary to rumors and press reports. Thus, to date, our actions have not given rise to concern that we will violate Paul's Dictum.\n\nThis is important, for there are concerns in some quarters that the Federal Reserve will be politicized. For example, there have been suggestions that Congress should be involved in the selection of Federal Reserve Bank presidents, who, unlike the seven members of the Board of Governors, are not appointed by the president nor confirmed by the Senate. I trust that Congress will resist this initiative and not upset the careful federation that has for so long balanced the interests of Main Street with those of Washington, just as we at the Federal Reserve must resist the urgings of some to accommodate the short-term financing needs of the Treasury.\n\nYour central bank has worked hard to pull the economy back from the abyss. To be sure, the FOMC has taken risks to do so. We have no doubt erred on occasion, but for the most part, I think we have gotten it right—primarily because each of us has an abiding faith in the time-tested virtues of conducting responsible monetary policy. We will work hard to remain virtuous, always bearing in mind that our job is to conduct monetary policy with the simple, yet profound, mission of underpinning sustainable economic growth without sacrificing price stability.\n\nSo much for the Gospel according to the Dallas Fed! Thank you for letting me speak to you tonight. I will now do my utmost to avoid answering any questions you have.",

            "content": "May 15, 2009 San Antonio, Texas\n\nI have just read to you four passages from financial scripture. In this morning’s sermon, I plan to make reference to each of those passages as we explore where we have been and where we might be headed.\n\nBut first, I want to thank the Texas Bankers Association for having me here this morning and Victor Pierson, the honorable mayor of Jamaica Beach and president of Moody National Bank, for that kind introduction. Besides being pivotal in the organization of the TBA some 125 years ago, the Moody family has played a rich role in the life of Texas since well before that time (a fulsome history I heard often—always accompanied with a wry sense of humor—from old Dan Oppenheimer back in the 1980s). The lineal and business and banking descendents of Col. William L. Moody have navigated hurricanes, wars, depressions and banking crises—all of epic proportions—and have always remained standing. They are a monument to Texas resilience. It is an honor to be introduced by anybody associated with the Moody legacy.\n\nNow to the sermon.\n\nI once managed Dan Oppenheimer’s personal portfolio. One afternoon in 1982, I was visiting Dan at the Oppenheimer Bank here in San Antonio. A Baptist preacher came in to ask him for a “loan.”[1] He wanted to buy some cattle. Dan was teasing him about the prosperity he had achieved while preaching from the pulpit and warned him not to count on its permanence. “Your congregation might become as prominent as you,” he said, “and then migrate to a nicer church.” To illustrate the point, he invented a story about a Baptist preacher who visited a shelter where he found a man who looked particularly downtrodden. The generous preacher took pity upon the man. He took him to a barber for a shave and a haircut and to a store for a pair of shoes, a shirt, a tie and a new suit. The preacher then dropped the man back at the shelter, handed him $20 and told him, “Son, you have been saved. The Baptist church is just one block away from here. I want you to come to my church on Sunday and praise the Lord.”\n\nSunday came but the man did not. So immediately after the service, the preacher went to the shelter. There was the man, sitting in a rocking chair, all dressed up and beautifully groomed, reading a newspaper. “Son, I had asked you to come to the Baptist church this morning to give testimony to having been saved. Where were you?” asked the preacher.\n\n“Pastor,” the man replied, “I surely did go to church. I woke up this morning, shaved my whiskers, combed my hair, put on this beautiful shirt and tie you bought me and dressed in this new suit. I put on these fancy new shoes. When I looked in the mirror, I felt like a millionaire. So I spent the $20 and took a cab to the Episcopal church.”\n\nI certainly don’t need to tell a room full of Texas bankers what got the nation into its current economic situation. A sudden new set of circumstances, easy money seemingly heaven-sent and the short-sighted suspension of time-tested, prudent financial practice led us on the road, not to salvation, but to economic perdition.\n\nAllow me to address each of these individually.\n\nThe new set of circumstances included the economic and financial windfalls that came from at least two major structural changes. The first was the end of the Cold War and the commercial reorientation of China, Vietnam, India and Eastern Europe, which unleashed enormous new capacity for the increased production of goods and services, held down costs and restructured the global economic map. The second was the explosion of computational power and communication ease that came from technological advancement and the Internet, facilitating globalization and leapfrogging frontiers that formerly separated the economic landscape. The world was our oyster. It simultaneously gave us new consumers and suppliers. It provided new sources of funds as well as new places to invest.\n\nThe easy money may well have been encouraged by central banks that held interest rates too low for too long. But it was exacerbated by lenders, investors and consumers who—keen on enhancing returns that seemed pedestrian with a flat yield curve anchored by low, risk-free rates—“craved” and “devoured” new risk instruments. As a result, they came up with new “schemes” and “projects” and “phantasies” made more enticing by expanded markets and financial innovation.\n\nThe short-sightedness was manifest in the abandonment of prudential practices. For the banker and lender, the time-tested principle of “know your customer” took a back seat to the mad rush to package and sell exposure to others. For the consumer, living within your means became a less compelling discipline in a world where a house was not just a home but a means to financial gain. For the investor, prudence took on another dimension with the presumed ability to mathematize judgment and hedge away the risk of default.\n\nAnd yet, while the world had indeed changed, the behavioral pathology documented by Mackay and Bagehot in the 19th century—a pathology based on their studies of countless debacles through history—prevailed. A “plethora” of commercial and financial opportunity begat “speculative” excess that inevitably begat a “panic.” The thundering “herd,” spurred on by “the love of gain, the necessity of excitement or mere force of imitation” and “mad” with irrational exuberance for the upside, suddenly realized in 2008 it had “devoured” more risk than it could stomach and panicked. The financial system seized up and the economy descended into recession.\n\nWho is to blame? Well, if you had been listening to the radio on Feb. 26, 1933, you would know the answer. You would have heard a crazed Father Charles Coughlin, pastor of the Shrine of the Little Flower in Royal Oak, Mich., rail against “the Morgans, the Kuhn-Loebs, the Rothschilds, the Dillon-Reads, the Federal Reserve banksters, the Mitchells [2] and the rest of the undeserving group, who without … the blood of patriotism … flowing in their veins have shackled the lives of men and of nations with the ponderous links of their golden chain.”\n\nAdvance the tape 76 years. If you substitute Goldman Sachs for the Rothschilds, Lehman Brothers for Kuhn-Loeb, AIG for Dillon Read, Ken Lewis, Sandy Weill or John Thain for “Sunshine Charlie” Mitchell and keep the text about Federal Reserve “banksters,” you will have captured the liturgy of invective heard from Father Coughlin’s contemporary secular cousins. On airwaves and in the blogosphere, on editorial pages and even in the halls of Congress and foreign parliaments, critics have been casting about for whom to blame for “shackl(ing) the lives of men” and women from Bastrop to Beijing with the “ponderous links” that took us to the very edge of the abyss of global economic collapse.\n\nI will let you draw your own conclusions about who is to blame. In my time at the Federal Reserve, starting in 2005 and working predominantly under the chairmanship of Ben Bernanke, my colleagues and I have been focused primarily on finding a way to undo past errors and mend the system.\n\nI believe that the initiatives taken by my fellow “banksters” at the Federal Reserve prevented us from falling into the chasm of an economic depression. Beginning in August of 2007, we confronted a total breakdown of the financial system. In rapid order, we undertook a series of steps. We:\n\n—Created facilities to backstop money market mutual funds;\n\n—Initiated new measures in cooperation with the Treasury and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to strengthen the security of certain banks;\n\n—Undertook a major program to purchase commercial paper, a critical component of the financial system;\n\n—Began to pay interest on bank reserves;\n\n—Announced we stood ready to purchase up to $100 billion of the direct obligations of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks, then increased that sum to $200 billion;\n\n—Announced we would buy $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities backed by Fannie, Freddie and Ginnie Mae, then increased that sum to $1.25 trillion;\n\n—Announced a new facility to support the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by student loans, auto loans, credit card loans and loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, a facility which we have since stated we were prepared to expand significantly to other types of securities and beyond our originally planned $200 billion to $1 trillion; and\n\n—Began the process of purchasing up to $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities between March and September to help improve conditions in private credit markets.\n\nAnd, in a series of steps, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) reduced the fed funds rate to between zero and one-quarter of 1 percent, a process I supported once it became clear that the immediate inflationary tide was ebbing. Simultaneously, at the request of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, and again in a series of steps, the Board of Governors lowered the rate we charge banks to borrow from our discount windows, so as to lower the cost of credit to the economy.\n\nIn summary, the Federal Reserve did everything in its power to avoid making the modern equivalent of the “misjudgments” that Liaquat Ahamed argues were made by our predecessors in the 1930s (and, I should add parenthetically, that everyone and their sister feel Japan made in the 1990s).\n\nThere is evidence that our actions have succeeded in pulling the financial markets and the economy from the edge of the abyss. There are, as many have noted, some “green shoots” that have begun to sprout that will help end the contraction in output and set the stage for a recovery. In the world of finance, interest rates in key areas such as mortgages and the London interbank market have declined dramatically, enlivening the housing markets and reviving interbank lending; private bond market issuance has resumed and, indeed as you will see in this week and next week’s issuance calendar, at robust levels for both high-grade and junk issuers; and the stock market has rallied from its lows, bringing with it a surge in the volume of new stock issuance. While it takes some time for these improved financial conditions to start helping the broad economy, I am happy to see that some green shoots are also starting to emerge on Main Street: The most recent reports indicate that job losses may be slowing; trucking companies—a group often looked to as a leading indicator—report a slight pickup in sales; purchasing managers are reporting that the pace of decline in new orders has abated; and retail sales are getting slightly less worse.\n\nThese are encouraging signs. But we are not out of the woods. We have miles to go before we sleep.\n\nFirst quarter results for the nation’s largest banks are encouraging, but challenges remain. Confidence among business women and men—the creators of lasting, productive jobs and prosperity—has shown signs of revival but remains elusive. Consumers at home remain cautious, for fear of losing their homes or their jobs. The markets we sell into abroad—Mexico and Europe, for example—remain weak, while others such as China are perhaps more robust but are insufficiently sized to fill the hole left by consumers at home and in our larger export markets.[3]\n\nUnder these conditions, I envision a slow recovery. Not a V-shaped snapback—nor even a U-shaped one—but a very slow slog as we find a more sensible and sustainable mix between consumption and savings and investment.\n\nYou know the numbers that have been reported for the nation for the first quarter: Even after upcoming revisions, I venture we’ll find we contracted at somewhere between 5 and 6 percent at an annual rate. The pace of decline will moderate in the current quarter, and then we’re likely to bounce along the bottom for a while, perhaps punching through to positive growth as 2010 dawns. I would be delighted, but surprised, if meaningful sustained growth gets under way any earlier. Regardless, increases in unemployment, while mitigated by the expansion of government (particularly the need for census takers) will likely take us to a 10 percent jobless rate before we reverse course. And global excess capacity is likely to remain excessive for some time to come.\n\nAs to price stability—the touchstone of central banking—given the vast amount of slack worldwide, the near-term outlook for inflation is meek. Indeed, the recent pressures have been to the deflationary side, though we seem to have beaten that back.\n\nNeither deflation nor inflation engenders confidence. Both distort decisionmaking of households as well as businesses. Both inhibit sustainable employment growth. If you want to know the outlook for inflation over the next quarter or next year, look at current domestic and global slack: It is doubtful that inflation will raise its ugly head until employment and capacity utilization tighten. Looking further out, however, Milton Friedman—whom many consider the Moses of monetary policy—reminds us that inflation, defined as “a steady and sustained rise in prices,” is “always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.”[4] Bearing this in mind, we must be careful with the deployment of our monetary initiatives.\n\nAs the nation’s central bank, the Fed performs two major roles. One is the standard conduct of monetary policy—a blunt instrument of adjusting interest rates and the money supply to achieve our long-term objectives of price stability and sustainable employment. In performing that role, the Fed has lowered short-term interest rates to help cushion the economic downturn.\n\nThe Fed’s other role is to act as a lender of last resort—to stabilize financial markets when confidence breaks down and markets become unduly segmented and dysfunctional. This entails targeted injections of liquidity to keep markets functioning under dire circumstances. Reflecting the larger role of securities markets in funding loans, the Federal Reserve has extended its lender of last resort role beyond banks. Since the fall of 2007, the Federal Reserve has been aggressive in putting programs in place to revive the functioning of key credit markets and pull the economy away from the brink. These actions are not permanent injections of money that may later fuel inflation, but rather are temporary injections of liquidity to stabilize malfunctioning markets. As such, they are intended to promote financial stability, sustainable growth and price stability.\n\nThe Congress, spurred on by the new president, has been aggressive with fiscal policy. The good news is that if fiscal policy has been properly designed—and time will tell if it has been—it should propel the economy farther away from the edge and put it on its way to a new cycle of economic growth, somewhat tentatively at first but hopefully gathering momentum as time passes.\n\nPeople are understandably nervous about the combination of a dramatic expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet and a ballooning of federal budget deficits. I return to the Book of Ahamed and the Book of Volcker. Ahamed speaks of the miscalculations of policymakers. Volcker warns that the Fed cannot monetize deficits without heightening fears of inflation and negatively impacting the future course of interest rates.\n\nThose of us responsible for developing monetary policy must constantly bear both observations in mind. We have been very careful to calibrate our actions so as to accommodate the needs of credit markets and the economy, not political imperatives. We are well aware that some of our balance sheet additions, designed to pull markets and the economy from the edge, have raised a few eyebrows (like the $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities we have pledged to purchase if necessary—although it has unquestionably driven mortgage rates to historic lows). And while it is not unusual for the System Open Market Account to buy Treasuries along the yield curve, the FOMC’s decision to purchase $300 billion in U.S. Treasuries—a decision made to improve the tone in the private credit markets—has been viewed by some as skating a little too close to the edge of political accommodation.\n\nI can tell you that the FOMC is well aware of the doubts being voiced about its intentions. I can also tell you that nobody I know on the committee wants to maintain our current posture for any longer and to any greater degree than is minimally necessary to restore the efficacy of the credit markets and buttress economic recovery without inflationary consequences. Indeed, as I speak, we are studying ways to unwind our balance sheet in a timely way. Chairman Bernanke spoke of this just this past Monday in Georgia.\n\nIn the meantime, looming before us is the prospect of a heavy calendar of debt issuance by the Treasury. Between now and the end of the current fiscal year in October, the Treasury will issue just over $1 trillion in net new debt, with at least that much to follow in fiscal 2010. As the Book of Volcker warns, the Federal Open Market Committee can ill afford to be perceived as monetizing that debt, lest we come to be viewed as an agent of, rather than an independent guardian against, future inflation.\n\nAlready, there are concerns that the Federal Reserve will be politicized. For example, some have called for increased congressional involvement in the selection of Federal Reserve policymakers and a reduced role for member banks. I trust that the Congress will resist this initiative and not upset the careful federation that has for so long balanced the interests of Main Street with those of Washington, just as we at the Federal Reserve must resist the urgings of some to accommodate the short-term financing needs of the Treasury.\n\nYour central bank has worked hard to pull the economy back from the abyss. To be sure, the FOMC has taken risks to do so. We have no doubt erred on occasion, but for the most part, I think we have gotten it right—primarily because each of us has an abiding faith in the time-tested virtues of conducting responsible monetary policy. We will work hard to remain virtuous, always bearing in mind that our job is to conduct monetary policy with the simple, yet profound, mission of underpinning sustainable economic growth without sacrificing price stability.\n\nSo much for the Gospel according to the Dallas Fed! Thank you for letting me be here. Thank you for letting me serve you. And thank you for letting me tell one of my favorite stories about old Dan Oppenheimer, God rest his witty old banker’s soul.\n\nIn true central banking fashion, I will now do my utmost to avoid answering any questions you have.",

            "content": "April 17, 2009 Beijing, China\n\nThank you. I am delighted to be here at Tsinghua University, together with my colleagues, Mark Wynne, who is director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’ Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute, and Tao Wu, a Hubei-born senior economist and policy advisor at the Dallas Fed.\n\nI may have the longest experience in China not only of any Federal Reserve official, but perhaps of any American policymaker you will ever meet! My native Australian father and South African-born mother sailed out of Shanghai on the S.S. President Wilson just as the port was being shut down by the soon-to-be victorious forces of the Communist revolutionaries in 1948. In a story too long to tell here, my father had been dispatched to collect a dollar payment owed an American company—the Spazier Chemical and Soap Company. They left Shanghai for the U.S. with more than the money due Spazier: My mother was with child—me—and I was born the following March.\n\nSo my bona fides for standing at this lectern at this prestigious university in Beijing to discuss the economic predicament of the United States (and the Federal Reserve’s response) in a globalized world are as follows: I was assembled by an Australian–South African consortium in China, then shipped across the Pacific to become one of the innumerable factors that make for a dynamic economy that is uniquely American. When I served my government as an ambassador and trade representative in negotiating the bilateral aspects of your country’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), Madame Wu Yi once told me, “Of course you have done well in America. You were manufactured in China!”\n\nThirty years after my date of “manufacture,” I served in the Carter administration as coordinator of policy planning and assistant to Treasury Secretary Michael Blumenthal. Secretary Blumenthal brought me to China in 1979. I mention this for a reason. That early experience in China, coupled with my involvement 20 years later as deputy U.S. trade representative in negotiating China’s accession to the WTO for President Clinton, forms the lens through which I now view China’s success, challenges and potential.\n\nI am going to anchor my remarks today with some perspectives gained from that trip to China in 1979. Then I will turn to the economic situation of the United States and the Federal Reserve’s response, in keeping with our duties as the central bank of the largest economy in the world. Finally, I will endeavor to answer any questions you wish to ask.\n\nThroughout, please bear in mind that I am a Texan. Texans speak plainly and directly. In an academic setting like Tsinghua, I trust you will consider my candor as keeping fully in the spirit of intellectual exchange.\n\nA Short Historical Perspective\nPresident Nixon famously normalized political relations with China in his meetings with Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai in 1972. It fell to President Carter, however, to settle the counterclaims between the U.S. and China that stemmed from the Communist takeover in 1949. Chairman Mao’s forces did not seize the cash of Spazier Chemical and Soap, but they did seize the railroad stock and other assets the U.S. had lent to the Nationalist government; the U.S. government, in turn, retaliated by freezing China’s accounts in U.S. banks. Without settling those counterclaims, we could not normally trade with each other. So after months of rigorous preparation, at the behest of President Carter, Secretary Blumenthal and his team, including me as the secretary’s faithful chef de cabinet, dispatched to Beijing on Feb. 23, 1979, to settle the claims. We met with Secretary Blumenthal’s official counterpart, Finance Minister Zhang Jin-fu, then with Deng Xiaoping and Chairman Hua Guofeng.[1] We sealed the preliminary deal on March 1, after arduous negotiations with Deng, and that day officially raised the flag over the American Embassy in Beijing, establishing the fulsome diplomatic presence of the United States in China.\n\nThe memories of that trip flooded back as I prepared for today’s lecture.\n\nWhen we landed in Beijing on Saturday night, Feb. 24, 1979, our delegation was whisked off to the official guesthouse in Red Flag limousines. The roads into Beijing had no cars—not because the route had been cordoned off for our delegation but because there simply weren’t any. What traffic we did see included skinny horses, donkeys, camels, oxen, exhaust-spewing trucks and countless bicycles made in the Forever bicycle factory in Shanghai for the purpose of realizing Zhou’s “four modernizations.”\n\nThat was my first hands-on impression of China: There were no cars. Imagine that! Now, 30 years later, anybody attempting to navigate Chang’an Avenue on a bicycle would be taking his life in his hands. Beijing alone has over 2.5 million cars, and China overall roughly 40 million.\n\nAfter we reached the initial agreement to settle our claims, we flew to Shanghai on a People’s Liberation Army plane for a little R&R before returning to Beijing to tidy up some fine points and sign our accord. Your government had thoughtfully picked out the prettiest military women they could muster to serve us drinks and meals on the flight. On a whim, my counterpart and seat mate from the State Department, Robert Hormats, who is now vice chairman of Goldman Sachs, took out a Polaroid camera and took a picture of these impromptu flight attendants. You would have thought he had struck a match in some far corner of the world where fire had never been seen. The flight attendants squealed with delight, and the entire crew, including the pilots, came to the back of the plane to examine this previously unseen, newfangled technology that allowed photographs to develop after only a minute or so. Think about that. This was roughly a quarter century after Polaroid had become commonplace in the U.S. and four years after the first user-friendly personal computer was brought to market by Steve Jobs and the Apple Corporation. Yet, the Chinese public had never seen an “instant” camera, let alone heard of a personal computer.\n\nPolaroid has since filed for bankruptcy, having been overtaken by microprocessor-driven electronic cameras and photo-capable cell phones. Today, China annually produces roughly 100 million microcomputers, and it has 650 million domestic cell phone subscribers. Your country has become the world’s largest producer of semiconductors and the leading exporter of information technology goods.\n\nWhich brings me to China’s willingness to adopt and adapt. When Deng Xiaoping entered the room for the initial encounter with our delegation in the Great Hall of the People, he cackled, “Where are these big American capitalists we Chinese are supposed to be so afraid of?” During our meeting, he made a remark that paralleled his famous “black cat, white cat” theme—“it doesn’t matter if the cat is white or black as long as it catches mice.” Deng’s remarks encapsulated the importance of practical results over political correctness and economic development over ideological purity—both hallmarks of modern China. Deng made it clear to our delegation that China was intent on modernization and that the Chinese cat would be focused on catching droves of economic mice as it engaged the rest of the world, starting with the inputs and access from trade that would be liberated with our settlement that week.\n\nThis China has done. In 1979, the U.S. imported a mere $595 million from China under onerous tariffs; the Chinese did not have a single dollar in official reserves. Now, you send more than $300 billion in goods annually to the U.S. and hold on the order of $2 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, a majority component of which are U.S. dollar-denominated securities. Until recently, since Deng’s ascendancy, China has grown its economy at around 10 percent per annum, has become the world’s pivotal factory and is quickly moving to the cutting edge of technology.\n\nIt is worth noting that Deng and his successors’ approach to modernization differed from that of Japan. A contemporary of Deng Xiaoping told me that in a conversation with him in 1978, Deng had decided that, unlike Japan’s decision to utilize national champions to build its economy and then engage the world to leverage Japanese prosperity, the Singapore model of attracting the best and brightest from around the world up front would better pave the way for domestic development and quick growth. Thus, from the get-go, China has had an inherent stake in the success of globalization.\n\nOne final impression from that trip in 1979: During that trip, we were treated to a soiree in the Great Hall of the People on Feb. 27. The seventh act of the evening was a piano recital—a performance of Liszt’s “Hungarian Fantasy No. 6”—by a pianist named Liu Shikun. Today, Liu is regarded as China’s finest pianist; he has performed worldwide, including with Seiji Ozawa and the Boston Symphony for one of the best-selling classical music albums of all time. He had given his premiere performance at the age of 5. In 1949, at the age of 10, he had won the Chinese National Competition for Teenagers and Children. In 1956, at the age of 17, he was so brilliant in his performances around the world that the Hungarian government presented him with a lock of Liszt’s hair. He was a boy wonder, a musical genius who won innumerable international competitions worldwide.\n\nIf you read Liu’s official Chinese biography, you will note that “he has performed in front of several generations of Chinese statesmen, including Mao Zedong … Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao.” What it does not tell you is that he was imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution and, we were told, maintained his skills by carving a keyboard on the wall of his cell and playing it day after day, hearing its music only in his imagination. His performance for us that February evening in 1979 was one of his first public appearances since his “rehabilitation,” and it was so stirring that even our Chinese hosts were moved to tears.\n\nWhenever I contemplate China’s capacity to succeed in the global economy, I think of those first impressions of China of 30 years ago—the paucity of automobiles and the absence of computers; the determination of Deng Xiaoping to harness the best talent and techniques from all over the world; the example of the triumph over misguided policy that is embodied in the spirit and genius of Liu Shikun. And I conclude that as long as China continues to constructively engage the rest of the world and allow the tremendous talent of the Chinese people to flourish, the People’s Republic will not only be able to withstand the setbacks currently afflicting the global economy, but will continue to advance its standing as an economic juggernaut.\n\nOf course, in a globalized economy, we are all interdependent. To prosper, China needs and expects the largest economy of the world to overcome its economic and financial travails and lead the way to a global economic recovery. So let me now give you a briefing on the current U.S. situation.\n\nThe Present Situation\nThe data from the United States are grim. Our economy contracted at an annual rate of 6.3 percent in the fourth quarter of last year. I expect that when the numbers are properly tallied, we will have again contracted at a dispiriting rate in the quarter just ended. Unemployment is rising. We currently have roughly 13.2 million people without jobs, which equates to an unemployment rate of 8.5 percent. I expect the unemployment rate to continue rising to a level that could surpass 10 percent by year-end. Even in Texas, the most dynamic of the American states and the only large province in the U.S. to create jobs last year, we expect unemployment to rise, though not to national levels.\n\nAmong other things, this has compounded the problem of the much-watched housing market, where many of the problems we have encountered in our financial markets germinated: The most recent release of the Case-Shiller index reveals that home price declines accelerated in the 20 metropolitan districts tracked. Prices fell 19 percent on a year-over-year basis for the three-month period ended in January. But the problem with our economy is more pervasive. The men and women who operate our businesses and create and sustain employment have assumed an uncharacteristic defensive crouch. Confronted by dyspeptic financial markets, they are doing the best they can to preserve their margins by cutting costs (most significantly, the cost of labor), and running tight inventories, rationalizing supply lines, deferring all but the most necessary capital expenditures and, in general, avoiding risk. The result is an American economy in stasis. Presently, nothing is being ventured, and nothing is being gained.\n\nOf course, not helping matters is the implosion of our export markets, which are vital to the growth of an economy positioned to sell high-value-added goods and services—as well as agricultural and other basic goods—to others. The World Bank is predicting that global trade will contract by 6.1 percent in 2009.[2] The WTO is forecasting a 9 percent contraction.[3] This will be the first time since the 1940s that we have witnessed such a deep and synchronized retrenchment of global economic activity, and this makes tougher the task of growing the U.S. economy.\n\nOne of our founding fathers, James Madison, considered to be the father of the (American) Constitution, wrote that “the circulation of confidence is better than the circulation of money.”[4] There is presently a palpable lack of circulating confidence in the business community in America. Only when confidence is restored will the U.S. economy begin to grow again.\n\nCapital is the basis of capitalism. Without efficiently operating credit markets, the muscles of the economic body—private businesses that produce goods and services and employ workers and are the engines of prosperity—cannot function. Thus, the Federal Reserve has assumed a dramatically proactive and highly innovative role in seeking to restore vibrancy in the credit markets while stemming economic decline. This is an unaccustomed thing for our central bank. Ordinarily, the men and women of the Federal Reserve are the most shy and modest of economic agents. We prefer to move incrementally rather than exponentially, and we have historically treasured conducting our deliberations quietly and away from the public limelight. But confronted with a dysfunctional financial market and an implosion in our economy, in rapid order we have undertaken a series of very visible and widely broadcast initiatives. Over a period of a little more than a year, we:\n\nAnd, in a series of steps, the Federal Open Market Committee reduced the fed funds rate to between zero and one-quarter of 1 percent. Simultaneously, at the request of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, and again in a series of steps, the Board of Governors lowered the rate we charge banks to borrow from our discount windows, so as to lower the cost of credit to the economy.\n\nAll of this has meant expanding the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. As of today, the total footings of the Federal Reserve have expanded to roughly $2 trillion—more than a twofold increase from when we started in 2008. It is clear that we will grow our balance sheet even more as we complete our programs of purchasing longer-term Treasuries, expanding our holdings of mortgage-backed paper and purchasing larger amounts and different forms of asset-backed paper.\n\nBy being so proactive in straying from our usual business of holding plain vanilla, mostly short-term Treasuries as assets and by shifting policy away from simple titrations of the fed funds rate, we have raised a few eyebrows. But these are complex, trying times. Our economy faces a tough road. We are the central bank of the largest economy in the world, and we are duty bound to apply every tool we can to clean up the mess that our financial system has become and get back on the track of sustainable economic growth with price stability.\n\nThis expansion of our balance sheet has given rise to concerns that we may be:\n\nI understand these concerns. Especially from a Chinese perspective. Just as the effects of the arduous work and admirable thrift of the Chinese people are coming into fruition, your largest export market and source of much investment—the United States—enters a bone-crushing recession. And simultaneously, the largest and most liquid market for investing the hard-earned savings and reserves you have accumulated have become extraordinarily volatile.\n\nIt would be only natural for your leaders to wonder if the remedies we are applying to treat our economic pathology might eventually result in inflation and depreciation of the dollar.\n\nSo let me address each of these concerns in order.\n\nFirst, with regard to the potential inflationary consequences of our actions: Our assignment is to conduct monetary policy so as to engender sustainable, noninflationary job growth. Presently, the risk is deflationary job destruction. We have undertaken measures to counter that risk. And we seek to do so in a way that will not ignite the embers of either a future destructive inflation or a debasement of our currency.\n\nI have a reputation for being the most “hawkish” participant in the deliberations of the Federal Open Market Committee. I do not particularly like ornithological nomenclature—I would rather be considered a wise owl (and I certainly do not wish to be anybody’s pigeon). But I have a record that substantiates that “hawkish” reputation, having voted five times against monetary accommodation during the commodity-driven price boom of 2008. I consider inflation an evil spirit that rots the core of economic prosperity and must never, ever be countenanced. But it is clear to me that in this environment, inflation is unlikely to present a serious threat given the pervasive bias in the U.S. economy toward wage cuts and freezes, rising unemployment, the widespread loss in wealth that has resulted from both the housing and equity market corrections, continually declining consumption and business investment, and the anemic condition of the banking and credit system, all of which reinforce downside price pressures in a global economy groaning with excess capacity.\n\nFor as far ahead as I trust my forecasting ability[5] (that is to say, the next couple of years), the problem with regard to maintaining price stability most certainly is not inflation.\n\nWith regard to the fate of the dollar and the willingness of others to continue purchasing dollar-denominated debt, we realize that by purchasing Treasuries in volumes and of durations that are atypical, we are at risk of being perceived as monetizing the fiscal largesse of our Congress. And we are acutely aware that by intervening in the mortgage-backed securities and other markets that we are at risk of being perceived as blurring the lines between fiscal and monetary policy. We realize that this may give rise to some apprehension among large holders of Treasuries and agency paper such as your government and others in the Asian-Pacific region.\n\nAnd yet, let me remind you that over the past year since we began in earnest the process of using the new tools I have just articulated, the dollar has appreciated 17 percent against the euro and 29 percent against the British pound. Against the major reserve currencies, the dollar has depreciated against only one, the yen, and by 2 percent.\n\nHere are some numbers for you to contemplate: If a Chinese investor had purchased a three-month U.S. Treasury bill in March 2008 and rolled it over every three months until the end of this past month, the return would have been a negative 1.5 percent. That is hardly inspiring. But, had that same investor purchased and rolled over a three-month euro-area central government bond, the investment would have resulted in a loss of 16 percent.\n\nI would add that a foreign investor who moved out on the Treasury yield curve would have enjoyed superior returns to those just cited. In yuan terms, 10-year euro sovereigns would have earned a return of negative 11.6 percent over the past year. The equivalent return would have been a positive 9.5 percent for the Chinese investor in 10-year U.S. Treasuries. If I may paraphrase Andrew Mellon, at least for the period over which the Fed has been applying its new tools, it has been quite true that “gentlemen prefer American bonds.”\n\nCertainly for the past year to date, fears of debasement of fixed-income portfolios invested in dollar-denominated public debt due to the profound actions taken by the Federal Reserve have proven unfounded.\n\nBut that is in the past. As to the future, the underlying math becomes more complex: The net new supply of Treasury debt is predicted to expand by $2.5 trillion in the current fiscal year, versus $788 billion in the last fiscal year and only $145 billion in fiscal year 2007.[6] All things being equal, this would result in a move upward in yield and downward in price, providing negative returns absent any foreign exchange factor. But all things are not equal. For starters, the problems facing the largest competitive currency, the euro, are perhaps even more substantial than those confronting the United States. I will point to Spain as an example of a euro-area economy that led the European pack on the upside and now is cascading rapidly downhill. In the case of Japan, you are as aware as anybody of the economic and fiscal and political predicament they are faced with; I will say no more. My point is that demand for Treasuries and other official paper of U.S. government issuers will be determined by their attractiveness relative to alternatives, and they may well be judged more, rather than less, attractive under most reasonable future scenarios.\n\nMoreover, both the fate of budget imbalances and the potential for total returns earned by investing in U.S. securities depend on the efficacy of the fiscal policies Congress has advanced. These policies are designed to jump-start the economy while laying the groundwork for permanent structural reform. Time will tell if they achieve this multipurpose goal. If they do, they will engender growth of the economy and concomitant confidence in both the fixed-income and equity markets for private securities. In addition, tax flows will be restored and confidence boosted in the path of deficit reduction envisioned by the current administration in its budget projections. If these policies don’t jump-start the economy, then I am confident that the reaction within fixed-income markets will force those with the power to tax and spend, the Congress, to readjust their fiscal policies.\n\nI offer as evidence the revelation that came to the fiercely partisan Democratic operative James Carville during the Clinton administration. He said that were he to be reincarnated and wished to be the most powerful of all, he would come back not as a president or emperor or pope but as the bond market, for “[the bond market] can intimidate anybody.”[7] I suspect this respect for the power of bond markets remains true for the Obama administration and the current Congress.\n\nOf course, to maintain price stability and faith in the dollar, we must maintain the independence of our central bank, the Federal Reserve. The dangers that arise when monetary authorities become the handmaidens of political authorities are documented in countless historical examples—from the fall of ancient Rome to the Weimar Republic in Germany to the Nationalist Chinese government in the 1940s to modern Zimbabwe. In 2013, we will celebrate our 100th anniversary as the central bank of the United States. We are not as established as an ongoing entity as the Bank of England, nor as young as institutions such as the People’s Bank of China. This is not to say we are superior or always exemplary, but we are an elder in this business. We seek to be worthy of the veneration traditionally given to an elder. To this end, we must zealously guard our ongoing independence.\n\nWe have recently agreed with the U.S. Treasury to an accord to work together to support the goals of preserving both monetary and financial stability.[8] In this endeavor, it is the Federal Reserve’s job to maintain monetary stability, while the Treasury will enable the Fed to sterilize the impacts of its lending and securities purchases on its balance sheet—and on the balance sheet of the banking system. In essence, the Federal Reserve will not monetize the growth of the assets on its balance sheet that has been, and will continue to be, necessary to jump-start the credit markets that are so essential to the recovery of the U.S. and global economies. To put it another way, the Federal Reserve is in the process of acquiring the tools to short-circuit any inflationary consequences of its balance sheet growth.\n\nIn contemplating the future of the American economy and our ability to overcome our current financial predicament, I take great comfort in knowing that we have been faced with far tougher tasks and have always accomplished them. It is true that we Americans often confront storms of our making. We occasionally falter and get blown off course. But we never give up. And we always come roaring back stronger, leaner and more efficient than we were before. For 233 years, the people of the United States have demonstrated that they are masters of the process of creative destruction that economist Joseph Schumpeter articulated as the key to success for any economy, be it built upon Anglo-American or Asian-Pacific or any other principles.\n\nOur recent presidential election demonstrates that we are still possessed of a vibrancy and adaptability that the French social philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville found so inspiring in the early 19th century. As an American, I may be insufficiently humble—humility is, after all, anathema to Texans—but I think it reasonable to consider our track record and our adaptability to be the stuff of an eventual recovery that will take my country to new levels of prosperity. I am confident that the innovative policies being pursued by the Federal Reserve will facilitate and, indeed, expedite the recovery process. In doing so, we will serve not only the interests of the United States but also those of China. For without restoration of American prosperity, China cannot realize the successful accomplishment of the course I personally witnessed Deng Xiaoping initiate—a course his successors have so assiduously built upon and are working so hard to complete.\n\nNow, in the tradition that is the hallmark of central bankers everywhere, I will do my utmost to avoid answering any questions you may have. That’s a joke. I will be glad to answer questions in a straightforward manner for as long as you wish to ask them.",

            "content": "April 8, 2009 Tokyo, Japan\n\nDomo. Thank you. I am delighted to be here, together with my colleague Mark Wynne, who is the director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’ Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute.\n\nI first came to Japan with President Carter for the G-7 Summit hosted by Prime Minister Ohira in June of 1979. That experience whetted my appetite for Japanese culture. So after I returned to the private sector and had established an investment management firm in Dallas, I came back with my family to reside in Tokyo under the aegis of the Japan Society for most of 1990—arriving here shortly after the Nikkei Dow reached its all-time peak of 38,915. This gave me an invaluable opportunity to simultaneously learn about your country while providing my colleagues at Fisher Capital Management in Dallas insights into a financial market reversal of epic proportions—insights gleaned from an office kindly provided me by Nomura Research as well as from the bleachers on the various baseball fields where my teenage son played for the Minato Moose team in the Tokyo Senior Boys Spring League.[2]\n\nSeven years later, I rejoined the government and served President Clinton as deputy U.S. trade representative in numerous bilateral negotiations with your government. I also served as cochair with Deputy Foreign Minister Haraguchi of the multiyear, joint commission set up by Prime Minister Hashimoto and President Clinton on deregulation and competition. In this commission, we wrestled with everything from laws governing retail stores to electricity distribution to bid rigging in construction to financial deregulation and even what I referred to then as “mini-micro” issues—ranging from auditing standards to regulations governing law firms. I consider it a significant accomplishment for both sides that, today, one of the few issues from that agenda that remain unresolved is the matter of providing a level playing field for private insurance companies as they seek to compete with Japan Post Life Insurance, which like the rest of the Postal Savings system is now in a 10-year process of privatization.\n\nToday I have the honor of speaking to you in another capacity—as a representative of the central bank of the United States in my role as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, one of the Federal Reserve’s 12 operating banks.\n\nEach of the bank presidents participates in the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the body that sets monetary policy for the United States. The tradition of the Federal Reserve is that each member of the FOMC speaks only for himself or herself. I shall adhere to that tradition today. The observations I will offer today are my own and should be interpreted as a view only from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas—nothing more.\n\nI have been fortunate to see both my own country and yours from several perspectives. I have learned enough about Japan from my different experiences here and my amateur study of Japanese history and literature to know that I do not know much. The first Western interpretation of Japan that I remember taking to heart was that of Lafcadio Hearn, who wrote of “the immense difficulty of perceiving and comprehending what underlies the surface of Japanese life.”[3] I have worked with your government on trade issues, operated an investment fund from Tokyo, watched innumerable Japanese baseball games (I confess, at great risk in this audience of likely Giants fans, to being a fan of the Yakult Swallows, and even though they haven’t won a championship since 2001, I am hoping this 40th anniversary season for their franchise will be their lucky charm), read and re-read the classic works of Western interpreters like Hearn and [Edwin] Reischauer and [Karel] van Wolferen (and, my favorite as a baseball fan, Robert Whiting!) and studied the works of literary giants like Natsume Soseki and Tanizaki Jun’ichiro.[4] But I have barely scratched the surface of comprehending your rich and complex culture. These experiences have taught me enough, however, to be humble when addressing a Japanese audience of this distinction. So rather than prescribe policy to you, I will stick to describing the policy predicaments in which my own countrymen and women are immersed.\n\nOne of my favorite books in Japanese literature is Natsume Soseki’s Kokoro, a gorgeous novel written in 1914, two years after the death of the Emperor Meiji and two years before the author’s own death. Lafcadio Hearn offered what seems to me to be the best translation of the word kokoro—he defined it as “the heart of things.” In this lecture, I shall try to quickly get to the heart of things occurring in the U.S. economy. I will then summarize the consequences for U.S. monetary policy. And then, if you permit me, I will endeavor to answer any questions you might have. Throughout, I will do my best to achieve the stylistic simplicity that Soseki-san achieved in Kokoro, though undoubtedly without the beauty that is implicit in that novel, for there is little of apparent beauty in our current economic and financial situation.\n\nThe data from the United States are grim. Our economy contracted at an annual rate of 6.3 percent in the fourth quarter of last year. I expect that when the numbers are properly tallied, we will have contracted at a very similar rate in the quarter just ended. Unemployment is rising. We currently have roughly 13.2 million people without jobs, which equates to an unemployment rate of 8.5 percent. I expect the unemployment rate to continue rising to a level that could surpass 10 percent by year-end. Among other things, this has compounded the problem of the much-watched housing market, where many of the problems we have encountered in our financial markets germinated: The most recent release of the Case-Shiller index reveals that home price declines accelerated in the 20 metropolitan districts tracked, falling 19 percent on a year-over-year basis for the three-month period ended in January. But the problem with our economy is more pervasive. The men and women who operate our businesses and create and sustain employment have assumed a defensive crouch. Confronted by dyspeptic financial markets, they are doing the best they can to preserve their margins by cutting costs (most significantly, the cost of labor), and running tight inventories, rationalizing supply lines, deferring all but the most necessary capital expenditures and, in general, avoiding risk. The result is an American economy in stasis. Nothing is being ventured, and nothing is being gained.\n\nOf course, not helping matters is the implosion of our export markets, which are vital to the growth of an economy positioned to sell high-value-added goods and services—as well as agricultural and other basic goods—to others. The World Bank is predicting that the global economy will contract by 1.7 percent this year, and global trade by 6.1 percent.[5] This will be the first time since the 1940s that we have witnessed such a deep and synchronized retrenchment of global economic activity, and this makes tougher the task of growing the U.S. economy.\n\nOne of our founding fathers, James Madison, a coauthor of the Federalist Papers and considered by many to be the father of the (American) Constitution, wrote that “the circulation of confidence is better than the circulation of money.”[6] There is presently a palpable lack of circulating confidence in the business community in America.\n\nIn light of this, the Federal Reserve has assumed a dramatically proactive and highly innovative role in seeking to restore vibrancy in the credit markets while stemming economic decline. This is an unaccustomed thing for our central bank. Ordinarily, the men and women of the Federal Reserve are the most shy and modest of economic agents. We prefer to move incrementally rather than exponentially, and we have historically treasured conducting our deliberations quietly and away from the public limelight. But confronted with a dysfunctional financial market and an implosion in our economy, in rapid order we have undertaken a series of very visible and widely broadcast initiatives. Over a period of a little more than a year, we:\n\nAnd, in a series of steps, the FOMC reduced the fed funds rate to between zero and one-quarter of 1 percent, a process which I supported once it became clear that the immediate inflationary tide was ebbing. Simultaneously, at the request of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, and again in a series of steps, the Board of Governors lowered the rate we charge banks to borrow from our discount windows, so as to lower the cost of credit to the economy.\n\nAll of this has meant expanding the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. As of today, the total footings of the Federal Reserve have expanded to roughly $2 trillion—more than a twofold increase from when we started in 2008. It is clear that we will grow our balance sheet even more as we complete our programs of purchasing longer-term Treasuries, expanding our holdings of mortgage-backed paper and purchasing larger amounts and different forms of asset-backed paper.\n\nBy being so proactive in straying from our usual business of holding plain vanilla, mostly short-term Treasuries as assets and by shifting policy away from simple titrations of the fed funds rate, we have raised a few eyebrows. But these are complex, trying times. Our economy faces a tough road. We are the central bank of the largest economy in the world, and we are duty bound to apply every tool we can to clean up the mess that our financial system has become and get back on the track of sustainable economic growth with price stability.\n\nThis expansion of our balance sheet has given rise to concerns that we may be:\n\nI understand these concerns. And I have actively and loudly argued during deliberations of the FOMC that these risks represent a real and present danger. But I am here to tell you that I am not alone. The committee members—from the regional bankers like me to its chairman, Ben Bernanke, and other governors—are each and every one determined not to violate the basic tenets of Federal Reserve sanctity.\n\nLet me address each of these concerns in order.\n\nFirst, with regard to the potential inflationary consequences of our actions: Our assignment is to conduct monetary policy so as to engender sustainable, noninflationary job growth. Presently, the risk is deflationary job destruction. We have undertaken measures to counter that risk. And we seek to do so in a way that will not ignite the embers of either a future destructive inflation or a debasement of our currency.\n\nI have a reputation for being the most “hawkish” participant in the deliberations of the Federal Open Market Committee, and I have a record that substantiates that reputation, having voted five times against further accommodation during the commodity-driven price boom of 2008. I consider inflation an evil spirit that rots the core of economic prosperity and must never, ever be countenanced. But it is clear to me that in this environment, inflation is unlikely to present a serious threat given the pervasive bias in the U.S. economy toward wage cuts and freezes, rising unemployment, the widespread loss in wealth that has resulted from both the housing and equity market corrections, continually declining consumption and business investment, and the anemic condition of the banking and credit system, all of which reinforce downside price pressures in a global economy groaning with excess capacity.\n\nFor as far ahead as I trust my forecasting ability (that is to say, the next couple of years), the problem with regard to maintaining price stability most certainly is not inflation.\n\nWith regard to the fate of the dollar and the willingness of others to continue purchasing dollar-denominated debt, we realize that by purchasing Treasuries in volumes and of durations that are atypical, we are at risk of being perceived as monetizing the fiscal largesse of our Congress. And we are acutely aware that by intervening in the mortgage-backed securities and other markets that we are at risk of being perceived as blurring the lines between fiscal and monetary policy. We realize that this may give rise to some apprehension among large holders of Treasuries and agency paper such as your government and others in the Asian Pacific region.\n\nAnd yet, let me remind you that over the past year since we began in earnest the process of using the new tools I have just articulated, the dollar has appreciated 17 percent against the euro and 29 percent against the British pound. Among the major currencies, the dollar has depreciated against only one currency, Japan’s, and by 2.4 percent.\n\nHere are some numbers for you to contemplate: If a Japanese investor had purchased a three-month U.S. Treasury bill in March 2008 and rolled it over every three months until the end of this past month, the return would have been slim to none—about –1.4 percent. That is hardly inspiring. But, had that same investor purchased and rolled over a three-month euro-area central government bond, the investment would have resulted in a loss of 16 percent. A Chinese investor investing in euro bonds would have had the same experience. A Korean investor investing in the same manner would have earned a return of 21 percent in euros but would have earned a 42 percent return in won terms had he invested in three-month Treasury bills.\n\nCertainly for the past year to date, fears of debasement of fixed-income portfolios invested in dollar-denominated public debt have proven unfounded. To be sure, an investment in comparable maturities in yen would have earned a modest positive return of 0.47 percent for a Japanese investor. But, adjusted for liquidity, that is hardly sufficient incentive for not having a predominance of the world’s most significant currency in a portfolio.\n\nI would add that a foreign investor who moved out on the Treasury yield curve would have enjoyed superior returns to those just cited. In yen terms, 10-year sovereign Japanese paper earned a return of 2 percent from March of 2008 to March of this year. Ten-year euro sovereigns would have earned a return of negative 11.5 percent in yen terms. The equivalent return would have been a positive 10.4 percent for the Japanese investor in 10-year U.S. Treasuries. If I may paraphrase Andrew Mellon, at least for the period over which the Fed has been applying its new tools, it has been quite true that “gentlemen prefer American bonds.”\n\nBut that is in the past. As to the future, the underlying math becomes more complex: The net new supply of Treasury debt is predicted to expand by $2.5 trillion in the current fiscal year, versus $788 billion in the last fiscal year and only $145 billion in fiscal year 2007.[7] All things being equal, this would result in a move upward in yield and downward in price, providing negative returns absent any foreign exchange factor. But all things are not equal. For starters, the problems facing the largest competitive currency, the euro, are perhaps even more substantial than those confronting the United States. I will point to Spain and Ireland as examples of euro-area economies that led the European pack on the upside and now are cascading rapidly downhill. In the case of Japan, you are as aware as anybody of the economic and fiscal and political predicament you are faced with; I will say no more. My point is that demand for Treasuries and other official paper of U.S. government issuers will be determined by their attractiveness relative to alternatives, and they may well be judged more, rather than less, attractive under most reasonable future scenarios.\n\nMoreover, both the fate of budget imbalances and the potential for total returns earned by investing in U.S. securities depend on the efficacy of the fiscal policies Congress has advanced. These policies are designed to jump-start the economy while laying the groundwork for permanent structural reform. Time will tell if they achieve this multipurpose goal.

He said that were he to be reincarnated and wished to be the most powerful of all, he would come back not as a president or a pope but as the bond market, for “[the bond market] can intimidate anybody.”[8] I suspect this respect for the power of bond markets remains true for the Obama administration and the current Congress.\n\nAs to the independence of the Federal Reserve, let me remind you that in 2013, we will celebrate our 100th anniversary as the central bank of the United States. We are not as established as an ongoing entity as the Bank of England, nor as young as institutions such as the People’s Bank of China. This is not to say we are superior or always exemplary, but we are an elder in this business. We seek to be worthy of the veneration traditionally given to an elder.

As an American, I may be insufficiently humble, but I consider our track record and our adaptability the stuff of an eventual recovery that will take my country to new levels of prosperity. I am confident that the innovative policies being pursued by the Federal Reserve will facilitate and, indeed, expedite the recovery process.\n\nOne of the unique cultural artifacts that I found intriguing while I was here in Japan in 1990 was the senninbari. For the Western press that is here, these are the “thousand stitch cloths” that originated during the Sino-Japanese War. By tradition, they consisted of a strip of white cloth embellished with 1,000 French stitches sewn with red thread by a thousand women and given to soldiers to ward off bullets and ensure a safe return. There should be no doubt that we at the Federal Reserve, like central bankers everywhere, are subject to attack by the bullets of a severe global recession and financial turbulence. Perhaps we could use senninbari to protect us. But as symbolically and emotionally meaningful as they might have been, senninbari were no substitute for prudent maneuvering on the battlefield. As part of the team working very hard to successfully maneuver our central bank through the current financial battlefield, my colleagues and I are committed to the utmost to conducting monetary policy not only so as to ward off the bullets and other threats to our economy but to emerge from this stressful period with an American economy that is stronger and better and that plays an important role in renewing the vibrancy of the global economy.\n\nAnd now, in the tradition that is the hallmark of central bankers everywhere, I will do my best to avoid answering any questions you may have.\n\nGoseichou arigato gozaimashita.

            "content": "March 26, 2009 Dayton, Ohio\n\nEnough of this dismal stuff.\n\nI want to now put on my hat as a former investor and address the purpose of this conference: identifying investment strategies and opportunities.\n\nI opened with reference to Queen Elizabeth's \"annus horribilis.\" To be sure, 2008 might not have been the only \"annus horribilis\" we will have. It might well be extended to a biennium as we work to untie the Gordian knot of the economic mess in which we find ourselves. However glum you may feel, I remind you that the queen's reference was a play on words from a poem written in the year 1667 by John Dryden, titled \"Annus Mirabilis\"—the \"Year of Miracles\"—about the period of 1665 to 1666.\n\nGet this: The \"Year of Miracles\" that Dryden wrote about began with the Great Plague of London—a pandemic of something akin to bubonic plague—and ended with the Great Fire that burned London for five days.\n\nSo why did Dryden call it the \"Year of Miracles?\" Because from the wreckage, London rebuilt itself and arose from the ashes with wide streets, modern sewers and buildings commissioned by Charles II and designed by the great architect Christopher Wren that were so solidly constructed they last to this day. Our task is to turn the current \"annus horribilis\" into an opportunity, just as the Brits did 350 years ago—to emerge from the current economic wreckage stronger and better and more resilient than ever. If England could do it in the 17th century, we Americans, who face a far lesser challenge and have never, ever flinched from staring down and overcoming adversity, can certainly do it now. Turning something \"horribilis\" into a thing that is \"mirabilis\" is the American thing to do.\n\nViewed from this perspective, the current economic and financial predicament represents a potential gold mine rather than a mine field. Historically, great investors have made their money by climbing a wall of worry rather than letting a woeful consensus cow them.\n\nHere is a take-home quote from Charles Mackay's classic tome Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, written in 1841: \"Men think in herds … [and] they go mad in herds.\" Just as the astute investor should have resisted joining the thundering herd's mad euphoria, I suggest you resist joining in the current stampede of despair.\n\nBe ever mindful of the power of economic Darwinism, of what the great economist Joseph Schumpeter called \"creative destruction.\"\n\nWhile today's economic equivalent of brontosaurus die a slow death or are eventually dismantled by regulators, new, more adaptable replacements will emerge. Your job as investors is to identify the new, rather than mourn the old, to ferret out from the general market malaise good financial and business operators whose franchises and prospects are overdiscounted at current prices.\n\nWere I you—were I in my old business of being a market operator and investor—I would be licking my chops at the opportunities that always abound in times of adversity, while those who got too big or too dysfunctional lick their wounds.\n\nIn the parlance of the trade, there are a lot of dollar bills that can be found in the debris of the current markets that can be picked up for nickels and dimes.\n\nGo out and pick 'em up.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "March 4, 2009 Fort Worth, Texas\n\nThank you, Dan [Petty]. Dan and I go way, way back. I have enjoyed his friendship for over 30 years, from when we were just young pups in the Dallas Assembly and numerous other fora. I am always honored to be in Dan's presence, let alone to be introduced by him.\n\nThese are tough, challenging times for business men and women like you, central bankers like me, and for the legislators in Washington whom we collectively entrust with the power to tax and spend our hard-earned money—money whose purchasing power my colleagues at the Fed and I are duty bound to preserve and grow.\n\nIn preparing my talk for you today, I thought of a phrase coined by Queen Elizabeth II in her speech in 1992 marking the 40th anniversary of her accession to the throne. You may remember that that was the year when a series of personal tragedies, including the burning of Windsor Castle, beset her family. With classic British understatement, she told her subjects: \"1992 is not a year on which I shall look back with undiluted pleasure.… It has turned out to be an 'Annus Horribilis.'\" [1]\n\nFor all of us on this side of \"the Pond,\" this past year, 2008, was an annus horribilis—a truly horrible year that only a sadist could look back upon with pleasure.\n\nI want to talk to you today about what has happened and what we at the Federal Reserve are doing about it.\n\nYou all know the events that have transpired; I will not belabor them. They are neatly encapsulated in the most recent data.\n\nOur gross domestic product shrank at an annualized pace of 6.2 percent in the final quarter of 2008. Even here in Texas, we saw our economy shrink in the fourth quarter. Abroad, the European Union's economy declined at an annualized rate of 5.8 percent, England's by 5.9 percent, Japan's by 12.7 percent and Korea's by 20.6 percent. And China's growth tapered down significantly to a reported year-over-year rate of 6.8 percent. Our closest neighbors saw their economies shift into reverse gear: Mexico's economy contracted, as did that of Canada, a net oil exporter with a surplus in its federal budget, low corporate and consumer debt levels, and no apparent subprime mortgage problems.\n\nAll indicators thus far point to our economy being on track for a decline of roughly the same magnitude in the first quarter of 2009. Just last month, we learned that U.S. industrial production declined by 1.8 percent in January and that overall manufacturing output declined 12.9 percent over the past year. And while the pace of contraction seems to have slowed somewhat, the Institute for Supply Management reported on Monday that this broad-based manufacturing decline has officially continued through the first two months of 2009. Mind you, it is worse elsewhere. Japanese industrial production in the first three months of 2009 is expected to be 33 percent lower than it was one year ago. For historical perspective, you may recall that in the classic 1954 film, Godzilla destroyed Tokyo, which then represented roughly a third of Japan's industrial production. We might call this the Godzilla Economy: It presents a monstrous challenge.\n\nThis challenge is vexing to bankers and other creditors, to investors, and to business operators. The credit intermediation process has become dysfunctional, and as for stocks, the S&P 500 Index has become historically and hysterically volatile; it closed yesterday roughly 55 percent off its October 2007 peak. British stocks are off 40-some-odd percent over the same period, the German DAX and the Hang Seng Index are down over 50 percent, and the Nikkei Dow for Japan is down almost 60 percent.\n\nI will not venture to predict the future of our manic-depressive friend, Mr. Market. But I do know the consequences of his intemperate disposition. Faced with unforgiving stock and credit markets, American businesses are doing what they can to stay profitable: As demand for their products shrinks, they are slashing every cost factor under their control to preserve their profit margins. They are addressing their cost of labor by aggressively cutting \"head count.\" They are delaying capital expenditures, tightening inventory management and demanding that suppliers cut their prices. They are watching their receivables and stretching out their payables. And they are taking every step they can to clean up their balance sheets. (One of my colleagues recently quipped that when looking at the balance sheets of consumers or banks or many other companies these days, nothing on the left is left and nothing on the right is right.)\n\nThere are plenty of armchair quarterbacks who now claim to have seen all this coming. Indeed, we must acknowledge that many in the financial community, including those at the Federal Reserve, failed to either detect or act upon the telltale signs of financial system excess.\n\nPaul Volcker told me recently that in his day, he knew that a bank was headed for trouble when it grew too fast, moved into a fancy new building, placed the chairman of the board as the head of the art committee and hired McKinsey & Co. to do an incentive compensation study for the senior officers.\n\nPaul Volcker is the wisest of men. Yet, I believe the following, written by another wise man, provides a more fulsome and insightful description of what we recently experienced. This is a long quote, so bear with me, as it perfectly captures the circumstances that led up to our current predicament:\n\n\"Every now and then the world is visited by one of these delusive seasons, when 'the credit system' ... expands to full luxuriance: everyone trusts everybody; a bad debt is a thing unheard of; the broad way to certain and sudden wealth lies plain and open; and men ... dash forth boldly from the facility of borrowing.\n\n\"Promissory notes, interchanged between scheming individuals, are liberally discounted at the banks.... Everyone talks in [huge amounts]; nothing is heard but gigantic operations in trade; great purchases and sales of real property, and immense sums [are] made at every transfer. All, to be sure, as yet exists in promise; but the believer in promises calculates the aggregate as solid capital....\n\n\"Speculative and dreaming ... men ... relate their dreams and projects to the ignorant and credulous, dazzle them with golden visions, and set them maddening after shadows. The example of one stimulates another; speculation rises on speculation; bubble rises on bubble....\n\n\"Speculation ... casts contempt upon all its sober realities. It renders the [financier] a magician, and the [stock] exchange a region of enchantment.... No 'operation' is thought worthy of attention that does not double or treble the investment. No business is worth following that does not promise an immediate fortune....\n\n\"Could this delusion always last, life ... would indeed be a golden dream; but [the delusion] is as short as it is brilliant.\"[2]\n\nThat was not written this past year by Martin Wolf of the Financial Times or Paul Gigot of the Wall Street Journal or David Brooks of the New York Times. It was written by Washington Irving in his famous \"Crayon Papers\" about the Mississippi Bubble fiasco of 1719.\n\nIrving, mind you, had never heard of a subprime mortgage or a credit default swap or any of the other modern financial innovations that are proving so vexing to credit markets today. He had never heard of Bernie Madoff or Allen Stanford. But he understood booms propelled by greed and tomfoolery and what happens when what one old colleague called \"irrational exuberance\" is replaced by irrational un-exuberance—when what was a sure thing yields to uncertainty. Uncertainty is the ultimate enemy of decisionmaking, forcing an otherwise robust credit system into a defensive crouch. (A fellow being interviewed on television not long ago was asked what positions he would advise his clients to take to ride out the current storm. He replied, \"Cash and fetal.\")\n\nWith uncertainty in full fever, cash is hoarded, counterparties are viewed with suspicion and no business appears worthy of financing. The economy, starved of the lifeblood of capital, staggers and begins to weaken.\n\nSo what have we at the Federal Reserve done about it?\n\nIn normal times, central bankers appear to be the most laconic genus of the human species. In times of distress, we believe in the monetary equivalent of the Powell Doctrine: We believe that good ideas, properly vetted and appropriately directed with an exit strategy in mind, can and should be brought to bear with overwhelming force to defeat threats to economic stability.\n\nIn rapid order, over the course of a year, we took at least eight major initiatives: (1) We established a lending facility for primary securities dealers, taking in new forms of collateral to secure those loans; (2) we initiated so-called swap lines with the central banks of 14 of our major trading partners, ranging from the European Central Bank to the Bank of Canada and the Banco de México to the Monetary Authority of Singapore, to alleviate dollar funding problems in those markets; (3) we created facilities to backstop money market mutual funds; (4) working with the U.S. Treasury and the FDIC, we initiated new measures to strengthen the security of certain banks; (5) we undertook a major program to purchase commercial paper, a critical component of the financial system; (6) we began to pay interest on reserves of banks; (7) at the end of November, we announced we stood ready to purchase up to $100 billion of the direct obligations of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks, as well as $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities backed by Fannie, Freddie and Ginnie Mae; and (8) we announced, and just this Monday fleshed out, a new facility to support the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by student loans, auto loans, credit card loans and loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration—a facility which we have since stated we were prepared to expand significantly to other types of securities and beyond our originally planned $200 billion to $1 trillion, if needed.\n\nAnd, as you all know, in a series of steps, the Federal Open Market Committee reduced the fed funds rate to between zero and one-quarter of one percent, a process which I supported once it became clear that the immediate inflationary tide was ebbing (though I remain concerned about the effects low rates have on aging baby boomers and the elderly who played by the rules, saved and squirreled away money and are now earning meager returns on their fixed income portfolios and bank deposits). Simultaneously, at the request of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, and again in a series of steps, the Board of Governors lowered the rate it charges banks to borrow from our \"discount window\" so as to lower the cost of credit to the economy.\n\nAll of this has meant expanding the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. As of today, the total footings of the Federal Reserve have expanded to roughly $2 trillion—more than a twofold increase from when we started in 2008. It is clear that we stand ready to grow our balance sheet even more should conditions warrant. Our options include purchasing longer-term Treasuries, expanding our holdings of mortgage-backed paper and purchasing larger amounts and different forms of asset-backed paper.\n\nAs I said earlier, in times of crisis many feel that the best position to take is somewhere between cash and fetal. But it does the economy no good when creditors curl up in a ball and clutch their money. This only reinforces the widening of spreads between risk-free holdings and all-important private sector yields, further braking commercial activity whose lifeblood is access to affordable credit. We believe that the new facilities we have created will improve the functioning of credit markets and restore the flow of finance to the private sector.\n\nI realize that by straying from our usual business of holding plain vanilla, mostly short-term Treasuries as assets and by shifting policy away from simple titrations of the fed funds rate, we have raised a few eyebrows. One observer has posited that we have migrated from the patron saint of Milton Friedman to enshrining Rube Goldberg.\n\nI assure you the Federal Reserve has not abandoned the wisdom of Professor Friedman or any of the other established patron saints of central banking. But these are complex, trying times. Our economy faces a tough road. We are the nation's central bank and we are duty bound to apply every tool we can to clean up the mess that our financial system has become and get back on the track of sustainable economic growth with price stability. The men and women of the Federal Reserve spend every waking hour doing their level best to perform their duty. Even if we have to deploy a little Rube Goldberg engineering to get the task done.\n\nI would suggest to you that some of our innovative, Rube Goldbergian contraptions have begun to work. For example, the London interbank offered rate, known by its acronym Libor, has come down handsomely. This is important as most variable-rate subprime and Alt-A mortgages that will be reset in the immediate future are based on Libor. Our purchase of government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) mortgage-backed securities helped reduce the interest rate on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages to a record low of 4.96 in mid-January, according to Freddie Mac data that start in 1971—though the rate has floated back upward as the yield on longer-term Treasuries has risen with the new issuance calendar. And our commercial paper and money market fund facilities have improved the tone of the all-important commercial paper market—not just the A1/P1 paper market, in which we have directly intervened, but also in the A2/P2 market. It has also not escaped my attention that, while still quite high, the premium over Treasuries that some investment-grade corporations pay to borrow in the open market has declined substantially from its December peak, as has that for noninvestment-grade borrowers. In addition, corporate bond issuance has stepped up.\n\nDespite these accomplishments, we have miles to go before we sleep.\n\nPlease bear in mind that the Federal Reserve is only one arrow in the quiver that can be deployed to restore the nation's economic vitality. The power to stimulate activity through taxing and spending the American people's money lies with the Congress of the United States. All eyes have been on the stimulus package recently passed by the House and Senate and signed by President Obama. This was no easy task, and it was accomplished with unusual alacrity. Only time will tell if the stimulus, and the $3.5 trillion budget that has been proposed by the President for the coming fiscal year, will give our economic engine an activating short-term jolt without spooking the financial markets and/or encumbering or disincentivizing the entrepreneurial dynamic that has made for the long-term economic miracle that is America, and be executed, as Thomas Friedman reminded us recently in the New York Times, in a manner that encourages winners rather than \"bailing out losers.\"[3]\n\nI trust the Congress will get it right. And, in doing so, I trust that they—and you—will keep in mind both the limited powers of the Federal Reserve and the vital importance of allowing us to apply our own judgment on how best to exercise those powers in furtherance of our mandate—a mandate to promote financial stability, maximize sustainable job creation, and maintain price stability.\n\nAs a central banker, I am genetically programmed to be a worrier. In times of economic duress, there is always a temptation for political authorities to compromise the central bank. I saw this firsthand when I served in the Carter administration with the ill-advised imposition of credit controls. This was but one instance in a long history that stretches from the debauching of monetary probity in ancient Rome to the inflation disaster that is now modern Zimbabwe.\n\nLiaquat Ahamed, a former World Bank official and CEO of the bond management firm of Fischer, Francis, Trees and Watts, has written an entertaining book, titled Lords of Finance. In it, he notes that the founder of the German Reichsbank was Otto von Bismarck. When the Reichsbank was formed in 1871, Ahamed reports, Bismarck's closest confidant, Gershon Bleichröder, is reported to have \"warned [Bismarck] that there would be occasions when political considerations would have to override purely economic judgments and at such times too independent a central bank would be a nuisance.\"[4]\n\nIt is no small wonder that the political considerations of the First World War and the impulse to override what might have been the purely economic judgments of Germany's central bank led to the hyper-inflation of the Weimar Republic and the utter destruction of the German economy. I beg to differ with Herr Bleichröder. It is more important than ever that we maintain the independence of our central bank, keeping it free from being overridden by political considerations. As the executive branch and the legislature seek to navigate our economy to safe harbor, we must minimize the impulse to let political exigencies hamper the work of the Federal Reserve. If, in the process of doing what is right and proper by confining its activity to its singular purpose, the Federal Reserve becomes a \"nuisance,\" so be it. The Fed under Paul Volcker's leadership was certainly a \"nuisance,\" but you would be hard-pressed to find anyone alive today who would argue the fact that the Volcker Fed pulled the nation from the precipice of economic calamity. It is important that the Federal Reserve be left to do its job and no more.\n\nHaving drawn that line in the sand, let me conclude by venturing an opinion on another area where our lawmakers must exercise critical leadership: It is imperative that they withstand demands for protectionism, including disguised protectionism in the form of nontariff barriers, \"buy American\" provisions and restrictions on capital flows. What made the Great Depression regrettably \"great\" was the Smoot–Hawley Act, with which everyone in this audience is familiar. You may be less familiar with the Long Depression that began when a flowering of new lending institutions that issued mortgages for municipal and residential construction in the capitals of Vienna, Berlin and Paris turned a cropper and began the financial panic of 1873.\n\nIf you study that debacle, you will quickly determine that what transformed a severe global downturn into a depression that lasted 23 years was action taken by our buddy, the aforementioned Iron Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck. In 1879, he decided to abandon Germany's free trade policy and acquiesce to the growing demands of manufacturers and rural farmers for increased tariff protection. His actions were followed in quick succession by France and then by Benjamin Harrison, who won the U.S. presidential election of 1888 by running on a protectionist platform and eventually signed into law the tariff of 1890.\n\nI have been quoted as saying that protectionism is the crack cocaine of economics.[5] It provides a temporary high but is instantly addictive and leads to certain economic death. Were I not a taciturn, cautious central banker, I might have chosen my words with less constraint. As global growth slows and economic conditions in the United States toughen, our elected representatives, newly elected chief executive and his agents must resist with every fiber of their beings the temptation to compound our travails by embracing protectionism. For if they fail to do so, the economic situation we are now all working so hard to overcome will seem like a cakewalk.\n\nEnough of this dismal stuff. I would hate to leave this podium with your having concluded that I am just another sourpuss like seemingly all the economists and the pundits that you read in the papers or watch on television. I am, as I said, paid to worry. But I am a red-blooded American, as are all my colleagues at the Fed. I believe deep in my soul that when put to the test, Americans rise to the occasion, no matter how great the challenge.\n\nI opened with reference to Queen Elizabeth's \"annus horribilis.\" 2008 might not have been the only \"annus horribilis\" we will have. It might well be extended to a biennium as we work to untie the Gordian knot of the economic mess in which we find ourselves. However glum or \"lower-lipped\" you may feel, I remind you that the queen's reference was a play on words from a poem written in the year 1667 by John Dryden, titled \"Annus Mirabilis\"—the \"Year of Miracles\"—about the period of 1665 to 1666.\n\nGet this: The \"Year of Miracles\" that Dryden wrote about began with the Great Plague of London—a pandemic of something akin to bubonic plague—and ended with the Great Fire that burned London for five days.\n\nSo why did Dryden call it the \"Year of Miracles?\" Because from the wreckage, London rebuilt itself and arose from the ashes with wide streets, modern sewers and buildings commissioned by Charles II and designed by the great architect Christopher Wren that were so solidly constructed they last to this day. Our task is to turn the current \"annus horribilis\" into an opportunity, just as the Brits did 350 years ago—to emerge from the current economic wreckage stronger and better and more resilient than ever. If England could do it in the 17th century, we Americans, who face a far lesser challenge and have never, ever flinched from staring down and overcoming adversity, can certainly do it now. Turning something \"horribilis\" into a thing that is \"mirabilis\" is the American thing to do. We had best get on with it.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "February 23, 2009 Cambridge, Massachusetts\n\nThank you, Dean [David] Ellwood. Nancy and I are proud of our almost 40-year involvement with Harvard College and the Kennedy School and are especially grateful that our four children were blessed with a Harvard education.\n\nI am delighted to see so many friends from our various stages of Harvard life here tonight. I am tremendously honored to give this Albert H. Gordon Lecture. Al Gordon is 105 years old and an exemplar to us all—especially to stock pickers. I am told that on his birthday five years ago, he quipped that, having reached 100, he was \"going to split, two for one.\" The world would have been doubly enriched had he been able to do so.\n\nThis is humbling in more ways than one. Yesterday morning, as I got on the plane to fly up here, I turned to Nancy and said, \"In your wildest dreams did you ever envision me following in the footsteps of Mikhail Gorbachev, George H. W. Bush, David Rockefeller and Ban Ki-moon in giving the Gordon Lecture at the Kennedy School?\" And she replied, \"I hate to let you down, Richard, but after 35 years of marriage, you rarely appear in my wildest dreams.\"\n\nCertainly, few of us imagined in our wildest dreams that our global economy could have turned so rotten so quickly. Only yesterday, it appeared that the economy was cruising along in the most tranquil of seas. In the third quarter of 2007, we recorded our 25th consecutive quarter of economic growth. Unemployment hit a low of 4.4 percent in March of that year. And the stock market closed at an all-time high on Oct. 9, 2007, with the S&P 500 Index finishing the day at 1,565. To be sure, there were some signs of friction developing—most noticeably a heating up of headline inflation, which reached its peak at a 9.6 percent annualized rate in June of 2008. And there were fissures developing in the superstructure of the credit markets—most noticeably in the housing market but also on the balance sheets and income statements of major creditors and various consumers. But to the unsuspecting world, all was well.\n\nIn 2008, conditions shifted radically. You all know the events that have transpired, and I will not belabor them. They are neatly encapsulated in the most recent data. Our gross domestic product is no longer growing but shrank at an annualized pace of 3.8 percent in the final quarter of 2008, a figure likely to be revised downward after greater scrutiny. Even Texas, the only large state in the United States to have employment growth last year, saw its economy shrink in the fourth quarter. Abroad, the European Union's economy declined at an annualized rate of 5.8 percent, England's by 5.9 percent, Japan's by 12.7 percent and Korea's by 20.6 percent. And China's growth tapered down significantly to a reported year-over-year rate of 6.8 percent. Our closest neighbors saw their economies shift into reverse gear: Mexico's economy contracted, as did that of Canada, a net oil exporter with a surplus in its federal budget, low corporate and consumer debt levels, and no apparent subprime mortgage problems.\n\nLast Wednesday, we learned that U.S. industrial production declined by 1.8 percent in January and that overall manufacturing output has declined 12.9 percent over the past year. It is worse elsewhere. For example, Japanese industrial production is en route to declining by 30 percent this year. For historical perspective, you may recall that in the classic 1954 film, Godzilla destroyed Tokyo, which then represented roughly a third of Japan's industrial production. We might call this the Godzilla Economy: It presents a monstrous challenge.\n\nThis challenge is vexing to bankers and other creditors. The credit intermediation process has become dysfunctional, and as for stocks, the S&P 500 Index has become historically and hysterically volatile; it closed today roughly 50 percent off its October 2007 peak. British stocks are off 40 percent over the same period, the German DAX is down 49 percent, the Hang Seng Index is down 55 percent and the Nikkei Dow for Japan is down 57 percent.\n\nI will not venture to predict the future of our manic-depressive friend, Mr. Market. But I do know the consequences of his intemperate disposition. Faced with unforgiving stock and credit markets, American businesses are doing what they can to stay profitable: As demand for their products shrinks, they are slashing every cost factor under their control to preserve their profit margins. They are addressing their cost of labor by cutting \"head count\" so aggressively that unemployment appears to me to be headed in the direction of, and possibly past, 9 percent. Businesses are delaying capital expenditures. They are demanding that suppliers cut their prices and are tightening inventory management. They are watching their receivables and stretching out their payables. And they are taking every step they can to clean up their balance sheets. (One of my colleagues recently quipped that when looking at the balance sheets of consumers or banks or many other companies these days, nothing on the left is left and nothing on the right is right.)\n\nThere are plenty of armchair quarterbacks who now claim to have seen all this coming. Indeed, we must acknowledge that many in the financial community, including those at the Federal Reserve, failed to either detect or act upon the telltale signs of financial system excess.\n\nPaul Volcker told me recently that in his day, he knew that a bank was headed for trouble when it grew too fast, moved into a fancy new building, placed the chairman of the board as the head of the art committee and hired McKinsey & Co. to do an incentive compensation study for the senior officers.\n\nPaul Volcker is the wisest of men. Yet, I believe the following, written by another wise man, provides a more fulsome and insightful description of what we recently experienced. This is a long quote, so bear with me, as it perfectly captures the circumstances that led up to our current predicament:\n\n\"Every now and then the world is visited by one of these delusive seasons, when 'the credit system' ... expands to full luxuriance: everyone trusts everybody; a bad debt is a thing unheard of; the broad way to certain and sudden wealth lies plain and open; and men ... dash forth boldly from the facility of borrowing.\n\n\"Promissory notes, interchanged between scheming individuals, are liberally discounted at the banks....

Uncertainty is the ultimate enemy of decisionmaking, forcing an otherwise robust credit system into a defensive crouch. (A fellow being interviewed on television not long ago was asked what positions he would advise his clients to take to ride out the current storm. He replied, \"cash and fetal.\")\n\nWith uncertainty in full fever, cash is hoarded, counterparties are viewed with suspicion and no business appears worthy of financing. The economy, starved of the lifeblood of capital, staggers and begins to weaken.\n\nSo what have we at the Federal Reserve done about it?\n\nOf course, we could have let nature run its course for fear of making things worse. P. G. Wodehouse, my favorite comedic author, used to say that \"there is only one cure for gray hair. It was invented by a Frenchman. It is called the guillotine.\" But my colleagues at the Federal Reserve and I refuse to be fatalistic. (Besides, those of us who still have hair have seen it turn gray this past year.) Though in normal times, central bankers appear to be the most laconic genus of the human species, in times of distress, we believe in the monetary equivalent of the Powell Doctrine: We believe that good ideas, properly vetted and appropriately directed with an exit strategy in mind, can and should be brought to bear with overwhelming force to defeat threats to economic stability.\n\nLet me go back in history once more. The basic playbook for how a central bank, as the economy's lender of last resort, deals with a financial crisis was written in the 19th century by two men: Henry Thornton and Walter Bagehot.\n\nBagehot's prescription to counter a panic bears repeating: \"The holders of the cash reserve must be ready not only to keep it for their own liabilities, but to advance it most freely for the liabilities of others. They must lend to merchants, to minor bankers, to 'this man and that man' whenever the security is good.\"\n\nBagehot describes the response of the Bank of England to the Panic of 1825 by quoting its governor as follows: \"We lent it … by every possible means and in modes we had never adopted before; we took in stock on security, we purchased Exchequer bills, we made advances on [those] bills, we not only discounted outright, but we made advances on the deposit of bills of exchange to an immense amount, in short, by every possible means consistent with the safety of the Bank....\"[2]\n\nAll the while bearing in mind the advice rendered by Thornton, writing in 1802: \"It is by no means intended to imply, that it would become the [Central] Bank to relieve every distress which the rashness of [bankers and financiers] may bring upon them.... The relief should neither be so ... liberal as to exempt those who misconduct their business ... nor so scanty and slow as deeply to involve the general interests. These interests, nevertheless, are sure to be pleaded by every distressed person whose affairs are large, however indifferent or even ruinous may be their state.\"[3]\n\nIf you are looking for a cognitive road map of what the Fed has been up to as we navigate between the need to \"advance most freely for the liabilities of others, lend to bankers and merchants, and 'to this man and that man' whenever the security is good\" and the equally compelling need to fend off the moral hazard of relieving \"those who misconduct their business,\" you might dust off your Bagehot and Thornton.\n\nOf course, the panics of the 18th and 19th centuries were different in size and shape than those of recent times. The nature of financial crises changes with time, reacting to the dynamic contours of the economy and financial evolution. Thus we must learn from experience, augmenting the theories and models that come from the study of past remedies.\n\nI recently read Ken Follett's magnificent book World Without End.[4]. It is a massive tome that runs for 1,014 pages. (I was tempted to rename it Book Without End.) It deals with the Black Plague that crippled England and Europe in the 14th century. In those days, the monks were the intelligentsia, and those who practiced medicine were sent to Oxford to learn from the theorists of ancient Greece. The nuns were the nurses. In the middle ages, women were not allowed to attend Oxford, so they learned from doing.[5] While the monks adhered to the Oxford-taught, old orthodoxy of studying the \"humors,\" of bleeding, and of invoking the dictum of fiat voluntas tua (\"Thy will be done\"), the nuns adapted their techniques according to what actually worked. The punch line of World Without End is that the community where the story takes place is spared the worst effects of the Plague by a savvy nun named Mother Caris, who applies experience and adapts established methods and theories to address the needs of the time.\n\nWe at the Federal Reserve do not believe in the economic equivalent of \"fiat voluntas tua.\" We believe in using our powers proactively. We have dusted off our Thornton and Bagehot and then some. We have been neither \"scanty nor slow\" in addressing the pathology of our economy and financial system. We have \"lent by every possible means and in modes … consistent with the safety of the bank.\" And we have made abundantly clear that despite having reduced the target range for the federal funds rate to the \"zero bound\"—the old orthodoxy—we will not shy from pursuing all practicable means available to a central bank in supporting the functioning of financial markets and stimulating the economy back to a steady state.\n\nLike Mother Caris, we have learned from the experience of crises more recent than the ancient debacles of the Mississippi Bubble or the Panic of 1825. We have studied the mistakes made by other lenders of last resort who failed to properly deploy their forces in times of distress, such as the Federal Reserve in the 1930s and the Bank of Japan in the 1990s. And we have reviewed the actions taken by others more successful, such as those of the Swedish Riksbank in response to their banking crisis of the early 1990s. Thus, starting on Dec. 12, 2007, when the base interest rate—the fed funds rate—was 4.25 percent, we began expanding our balance sheet by providing access to credit for longer terms to eligible depository institutions to alleviate funding pressures in the system.\n\nIn rapid order, over the course of a year, we took at least eight major initiatives: (1) We established a lending facility for primary securities dealers, taking in new forms of collateral to secure those loans; (2) we initiated so-called swap lines with the central banks of 14 of our major trading partners, ranging from the European Central Bank to the Bank of Canada and the Banco de México to the Monetary Authority of Singapore, to alleviate dollar funding problems in those markets; (3) we created facilities to backstop money market mutual funds; (4) working with the U.S. Treasury and the FDIC, we initiated new measures to strengthen the security of certain banks; (5) we undertook a major program to purchase commercial paper, a critical component of the financial system; (6) we began to pay interest on reserves of banks; (7) we announced a new facility to support the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by student loans, auto loans, credit card loans and loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, a facility which last week we stated we were prepared to expand significantly beyond our originally planned $200 billion; and (8) at the end of November, we announced we stood ready to purchase up to $100 billion of the direct obligations of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks, as well as $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities backed by Fannie, Freddie and Ginnie Mae.\n\nAnd, as you all know, in a series of steps, the FOMC reduced the fed funds rate to between zero and a quarter of 1 percent, a process which I supported once it became clear that the immediate inflationary tide was ebbing (though I remain concerned about the effects low rates have on aging baby boomers and the elderly who played by the rules, saved and squirreled away money and are now earning meager returns on their fixed-income portfolios and bank deposits). Simultaneously, at the request of the 12 Federal Reserve banks, and again in a series of steps, the Board of Governors lowered the rate it charges banks to borrow from our discount window so as to lower the cost of credit to the economy.\n\nAll of this has meant expanding the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. As of today, the total footings of the Federal Reserve have expanded to $1.75 trillion—an almost twofold increase from when we started in 2008. It is clear that we stand ready to grow our balance sheet even more should conditions warrant. Our options include purchasing longer-term Treasuries, expanding our holdings of mortgage-backed paper and purchasing larger amounts and different forms of asset-backed paper.\n\nYou will note that the emphasis of our activities has been on expanding the asset side of our balance sheet—the left side, which registers the securities we hold, the loans we make, the value of our swap lines and the credit facilities we have created. Simple accounting dictates that the expansion of the left side of our balance sheet has been accompanied by an equally impressive expansion of the right side—the liability side. In this regard, the combination of banks' balances, Federal Reserve Bank notes and U.S. Treasury balances has grown tremendously.\n\nWhen the Japanese economy went into the doldrums, the Bank of Japan emphasized the liability side of its balance sheet by building up excess reserves and cash. The bulk of this accumulation was associated with an increase in government securities on the left side of the Bank's balance sheet, which seemed to do little to rejuvenate the system.\n\nAs I said earlier, in times of crisis many feel that the best position to take is somewhere between cash and fetal. But it does the economy no good when creditors curl up in a ball and clutch their money. This only reinforces the widening of spreads between risk-free holdings and all-important private sector yields, further braking commercial activity whose lifeblood is access to affordable credit. We believe that emphasizing the asset side of the balance sheet will do more to improve the functioning of credit markets and restore the flow of finance to the private sector. In the parlance of central banking finance, I consider this a more qualitative approach to \"quantitative easing.\" It is bred of having learned from the experience of our Japanese counterparts, much as Mother Caris learned from watching others' unsuccessful attempts at curing the Black Plague in her community of Kingsbridge.\n\nI realize that by straying from our usual business of holding plain vanilla, mostly short-term Treasuries as assets and by shifting policy away from simple titrations of the fed funds rate, we have raised a few eyebrows. One observer has posited that we have migrated from the patron saint of Milton Friedman to enshrining Rube Goldberg.\n\nI rather like Rube Goldberg. I recall fondly the complex devices his protagonist, the felicitously named Professor Lucifer Gorgonzola Butts, would deploy to perform different tasks. If you turn to Wikipedia, you will find one of my favorites: the self-operating napkin. As described therein, it was activated when a soup spoon (Exhibit A) is raised to the mouth, pulling on a string (B), thereby jerking ladle (C) which throws cracker (D) past parrot (E), who jumps after it, tilting perch (F), upsetting seeds (G) into pail (H), whose new extra weight pulls cord (I), which opens and lights automatic cigar lighter (J), setting off skyrocket (K), which causes sickle (L) to cut string (M) and allows pendulum (N) with attached napkin (O) to swing back and forth, thereby wiping face.\n\nI assure you the Federal Reserve has not abandoned the wisdom of Milton Friedman or Walter Bagehot or any of the other established patron saints of central banking. But these are complex, trying times. Our economy faces a tough road. We are the nation's central bank and we are duty bound to apply every tool we can to clean up the mess that has soiled the face of our financial system and get back on the track of sustainable economic growth with price stability. The men and women of the Federal Reserve spend every waking hour doing their level best to perform their duty. Even if we have to deploy a little Rube Goldberg engineering to get the task done.\n\nTo be sure, we have to be very careful in deploying our arsenal. For example, we are well aware that the issuance of new Treasuries is expanding at an eye-popping pace: Net new issuance of Treasuries was $145 billion in fiscal year 2007, expanded to $788 billion in fiscal year 2008 and, by most everyone's accounting, will broach $2 trillion in fiscal year 2009.[6] This \"guesstimation\" is based on the pace of issuance in the first five months of this fiscal year and the expected price tag for the recently approved fiscal stimulus package (but before a net cost is assigned to the bank proposals that will be forthcoming from the Treasury and before accounting for the budget about to be sent to Congress by President Obama). The Federal Reserve must, of course, be very careful to avoid any perception that it stands ready to monetize exploding fiscal deficits, as this would undermine confidence in our independence and raise serious doubts about our commitment to long-term price stability. These concerns certainly do not preclude some Treasuries purchases, however, as we seek to strengthen the economy in this time of crisis. With short-term Treasury rates near zero, an argument can be made that buying longer-term Treasuries would be especially effective in this regard.\n\nParenthetically, I would note that such purchases are not at all unusual. We routinely buy Treasury issues with a wide range of maturities in order to maintain a well-balanced portfolio. So, we are talking only about a possible change in emphasis here, not a sharp departure from past practice. That said, in my opinion, we certainly shouldn't try to peg long-term rates. Past efforts to do so soon have led to costly credit-market distortions and inevitably ended in tears. In my view, we must be very careful not to provide for an unsustainable and potentially disruptive distortion in the benchmark market for Treasuries through any extraordinary efforts above and beyond our normal balancing operations.\n\nSimilarly, we must be very cautious about the dimensions of our program to intervene directly in the market for asset-backed securities, making sure that our actions are the absolute minimum needed, and no more. Most important of all, we must continue to make clear that we will unwind our interventions in the market and shrink our balance sheet back to normal proportions once our task is accomplished, for this is, indeed, our unanimous and unflinching intention.\n\nI would suggest to you that some of our innovative, Rube Goldbergian contraptions have begun to work. For example, the London interbank offered rate, known by its acronym Libor, has come down handsomely. This is important as most variable-rate subprime and Alt-A mortgages that will be reset in the immediate future are based on Libor. Our purchase of government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) mortgage-backed securities helped reduce the interest rate on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages to a record low of 4.96 in mid-January, according to Freddie Mac data that start in 1971—though the rate has floated back upward as the yield on longer-term Treasuries has risen with the new issuance calendar. And our commercial paper and money market fund facilities have improved the tone of the all-important commercial paper market—not just the A1/P1 paper market, in which we have directly intervened, but also in the A2/P2 market. It has also not escaped my attention that the premium over Treasuries that investment-grade corporations pay to borrow in the open market has declined by 20 percent and by 25 percent for non-investment-grade borrowers and that corporate bond issuance has stepped up.\n\nDespite these accomplishments, we have miles to go before we sleep.\n\nPlease bear in mind that the Federal Reserve is only one arrow in the quiver that can be deployed to restore the nation's economic vitality. The power to stimulate activity through taxing and spending the American people's money lies with the Congress of the United States. All eyes have been on the stimulus package recently passed by the House and Senate and signed by President Obama. This was no easy task, and it was accomplished with unusual alacrity. Only time will tell if the stimulus will give our economic engine an activating short-term jolt without encumbering or disincentivizing the entrepreneurial dynamic that has made for the long-term economic miracle that is America. Next, our political leaders must agree to the funding, if any, of the Treasury's proposals for the resolution of the banking crisis so as to make the system more stable and viable—a resolution, as Thomas Friedman reminds us in Sunday's New York Times, that needs to be done in a manner that encourages winners rather than \"bailing out losers.\"[7] And, on top of all that, they must begin, now, to dig us out of the very deep hole they themselves have dug in incurring unfunded liabilities of retirement and health care obligations—programs that are already on the books but have not yet been paid for—that Pete Peterson's foundation calculates at $56 trillion and we at the Dallas Fed believe total over $99 trillion.[8] If you do the numbers, you will find that some 85 percent of those unfunded liabilities is due to Medicare; a budgetary Heimlich maneuver is urgently needed to keep Medicare from choking off our economic prosperity.\n\nWe are navigating uncharted, financially treacherous waters. Our fiscal authorities must carefully plot a course between the immediate needs for stimulus and the future needs of our children and grandchildren.\n\nWhen George Shultz was director of the Office of Management and Budget, he became frustrated with the spending impulses of the Nixon administration. He reports that he called the venerable Sam Cohen, a virtual encyclopedia of budgetary history, into his office and asked, \"Between you and me, Sam, is there really any difference between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to spending money?\" Cohen's reply was classic: \"Sir, there is only one difference: Democrats enjoy it more.\"\n\nMr. Cohen might have been a more \"equal opportunity\" wisecracker were he still around. No matter. We are beyond the point of either party's placing its immediate political needs ahead of the welfare of our children and successor generations. I am hopeful that the good people that President Obama has assembled to guide his economic policy, and the leadership of the House and Senate, will begin to prevail on Congress to finally begin filling in the gaping holes of unfunded liabilities. In my eyes, these unfunded programs represent the greatest threat to our long-term economic welfare and—given the historical temptation for politicians to ask central banks to monetize their profligacy—the independence of the Federal Reserve. Left unattended, these liabilities will surely tear asunder future American prosperity.\n\nI trust Congress will get it right. And, in doing so, I trust that they—and you—will keep in mind both the limited powers of the Federal Reserve and the vital importance of allowing us to apply our own judgment on how best to exercise those powers in furtherance of our mandate—a mandate to promote financial stability, maximize sustainable job creation and maintain price stability.\n\nAs a central banker, I am genetically programmed to be a worrier. In times of economic duress, there is always a temptation for political authorities to compromise the central bank. I saw this firsthand in the Carter administration with the ill-advised imposition of credit controls. This was but one instance in a long history that stretches from the debauching of monetary probity in ancient Rome to the inflation disaster that is now modern Zimbabwe.\n\nLiaquat Ahamed, a former World Bank official and CEO of the bond management firm of Fischer, Francis, Trees and Watts, has written an entertaining book, titled Lords of Finance. In it, he notes that the founder of the German Reichsbank was Otto von Bismarck. When the Reichsbank was formed in 1871, Ahamed reports, Bismarck's closest confidant, Gershon Bleichröder, is reported to have \"warned [Bismarck] that there would be occasions when political considerations would have to override purely economic judgments and at such times too independent a central bank would be a nuisance.\"[9]\n\nIt is no small wonder that the political considerations of the First World War and the impulse to override what might have been the purely economic judgments of Germany's central bank led to the hyper-inflation of the Weimar Republic and the utter destruction of the German economy. I beg to differ with Herr Bleichröder. It is more important than ever that we maintain the independence of our central bank, keeping it free from being overridden by political considerations. As the executive branch and the legislature seek to navigate our economy to safe harbor, we must minimize the impulse to let political exigencies hamper the work of the Federal Reserve. If, in the process of doing what is right and proper by confining its activity to its singular purpose, the Federal Reserve becomes a \"nuisance,\" so be it. The Fed under Paul Volcker's leadership was certainly a \"nuisance,\" but you would be hard-pressed to find anyone alive today who would argue the fact that the Volcker Fed pulled the nation from the precipice of economic calamity. It is important that the Federal Reserve be left to do its job and no more.\n\nHaving drawn that line in the sand, let me conclude by venturing an opinion on the business of our lawmakers: It is imperative that they withstand demands for protectionism, including disguised protectionism in the form of nontariff barriers, \"buy American\" provisions and restrictions on capital flows. What made the Great Depression \"great\" was the Smoot–Hawley Act, with which everyone in this audience is familiar. You may be less familiar with the Long Depression that began when a flowering of new lending institutions that issued mortgages for municipal and residential construction in the capitals of Vienna, Berlin and Paris turned a cropper and began the financial panic of 1873.\n\nIf you study that debacle, you will quickly determine that what transformed a severe global downturn into a depression that lasted 23 years was action taken by our buddy, the aforementioned Iron Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck. In 1879, he decided to abandon Germany's free trade policy. His actions were followed in quick succession by France and then by Benjamin Harrison, who won the U.S. presidential election of 1888 by running on a protectionist platform.\n\nI have been quoted as saying that protectionism is the crack cocaine of economics.[10] It provides a temporary high but is instantly addictive and leads to certain economic death. Were I not a taciturn, cautious central banker, I might have chosen my words with less constraint. As global growth slows and economic conditions in the United States toughen, our elected representatives, newly elected chief executive and his agents must resist with every fiber of their beings the temptation to compound our travails by embracing protectionism. For if they fail to do so, the economic situation we are now all working so hard to overcome will seem like a cakewalk.\n\nI am tempted to end this cheery talk by saying \"Have a nice day!\" and walking off the stage. However, I would hate to leave this podium with your having concluded that I am just another sourpuss. I am, as I said, paid to worry. But I am a red-blooded American, as are all my colleagues at the Fed. I draw on the wisdom of Marcus Nadler, one of the great minds of the Federal Reserve from a period when our economy endured an even greater \"stress test.\" To counter the intellectual paralysis and down-in-the-mouth pessimism that gripped the financial industry after the Crash of '29, Nadler put forth four simple propositions:\n\nFirst, he said: \"You're right if you bet that the United States economy will continue to expand.\"\nSecond: \"You're wrong if you bet that it is going to stand still or collapse.\"\nThird: \"You're wrong if you bet that any one element in our society is going to ruin or wreck the country.\"\nAnd fourth: \"You're right if you bet that (leaders) in business, labor, and government are sane, reasonably well informed and decent people who can be counted on to find common ground among all their conflicting interests and work out a compromise solution to the big issues that confront them.\"\n\nThis became known as \"Old Doc Nadler's Remedy,\" and for my part, it is spot on. Every one of us preoccupied with what ails us should keep it in mind.\n\nI conclude where I started, with wild dreams. It may seem like the stuff of the wildest dreams to imagine our getting ourselves out from our current nightmarish predicament. But I believe we can and we will. We are Americans. I believe deep in my soul that when put to the test, Americans rise to the occasion no matter how great the challenge. We have done it time and again. We have no choice but to do it once more, now.",

            "content": "February 9, 2009 Houston, Texas\n\nThank you, Dan [Yergin]. It is a pleasure to be here at CERAWeek and especially to be here in Houston, the energy technology capitol of the world.\n\nA week ago tonight, I returned to Texas from Washington, following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), some public talks to warn against the dangers of protectionism and finally a weekend of events surrounding the annual Alfalfa dinner.\n\nThe Alfalfa Club is an institution peculiar to Washington, D.C. Once a year, it holds a dinner devoted solely to poking fun at the political pretensions of the day. Tongues firmly in cheek, its members nominate a candidate to run for the presidency on the Alfalfa Party ticket. Of course, none of them ever win and nominees are thenceforth known for evermore as members of the Stassen Society, named for Harold Stassen, who ran for president nine times and lost every time, then ran a tenth time on the Alfalfa ticket and lost again. The motto of this distinguished group—which in addition to Stassen has included my fellow Texans Jim Baker, Lloyd Bentsen, Robert Strauss, Jack Valenti, and both George Bush '41 and George Bush '43—is Veni, Vidi, Defici—\"I came, I saw, I lost.\"\n\nThis year's dinner was the first for President Obama, who at the time had been in office only 11 days. Alfalfans introduced Vernon Jordan as the candidate to head their ticket and challenge the real president. Mr. Jordan appeared on stage in a stovepipe top hat. With a twinkle in his eye, he addressed President Obama and said, \"Mr. President, you may have noticed my hat. At the end of my announcement speech, I will pass it on to you. I must merely wear it. You must pull a rabbit out of it.\"\n\nCertainly concerning the economy, Jordan hit the nail on the head. The only description of recent economic developments I have heard that is as cogent came from a woman who, having just commiserated with her accountants, put it this way: \"This has been like the divorce from hell: My net worth has been cut in half and I'm still stuck with my husband.\" The mood and pace of the economy have shifted from near bliss to acrimony and an almost palpable sense of betrayal. Our self-confidence has gone wobbly. Many of our fellow citizens feel trapped in an unsustainable situation. The challenge facing the new president is daunting.\n\nOnly yesterday, it would have appeared to the naked eye that the economy was cruising along in the most tranquil of seas. In the third quarter of 2007, we recorded our 25th consecutive quarter of economic growth. Unemployment hit a low of 4.4 percent in March of that year. And the stock market closed at an all-time high on Oct. 9, 2007, with the S&P 500 Index finishing the day at 1,565. To be sure, there were some signs of friction developing—most noticeably a heating up of headline inflation, which reached its peak at a 9.6 percent annualized rate in June of 2008. And there were fissures developing in the superstructure of the credit markets—most noticeably in the housing market, but also on the balance sheets and income statements of major creditors and various consumers. But to the unsuspecting world, all was well.\n\nIn 2008, conditions shifted radically. You all know the events that have transpired, and I will not belabor them. They are neatly encapsulated in the most recent data. Our gross domestic product is no longer growing, but shrank at an annualized pace of 3.8 percent in the final quarter of 2008. By my estimate, it is on pace to contract further throughout this year. Industrial production is falling sharply; consumption is cascading downhill; demand has evaporated as businesses and consumers alike pull in their horns and de-lever from excess indebtedness that fueled the prior boom. Unemployment has increased to 7.6 percent at the last reading and appears to me to be headed in the direction of, and possibly past, 9 percent.\n\nBankers and other creditors, having noted that the horse long ago bolted from the confines of prudence, are now shutting the proverbial barn doors. The credit intermediation process has become dysfunctional. Once ubiquitous, credit has become quite expensive—if you can get it. As for stocks, the S&P 500 Index closed today 44.4 percent off its October 2007 peak and has become historically and hysterically volatile.\n\nI will not venture to predict the behavioral future of our manic-depressive friend, Mr. Market. But I do know the consequences of his intemperate disposition. Faced with an unforgiving stock market and creditors that have become tighter than a new pair of shoes, businesses are doing what they can to stay profitable: As demand for their products shrinks, they are slashing every cost factor under their control to preserve their profit margins. They are addressing their cost of labor by cutting \"head count.\" They are delaying capital expenditures. They are demanding that suppliers cut their prices and are tightening inventory management. They are watching their receivables and stretching out their payables. And they are taking every step they can to clean up their balance sheets. (One of my colleagues recently quipped that when looking at the balance sheets of consumers or banks or many other companies these days, nothing on the left is left and nothing on the right is right.)\n\nThere are plenty of armchair quarterbacks who now claim to have seen all this coming. Indeed, we must acknowledge that many in the financial community, including those at the Federal Reserve, failed to either detect or act upon the telltale signs of financial system excess.\n\nPaul Volcker told me recently that in his day, he knew that a bank was headed for trouble when it grew too fast, moved into a fancy new building, placed the chairman of the board as the head of the art committee and hired McKinsey & Co. to do an incentive compensation study for the senior officers.\n\nPaul Volcker is the wisest of men (and I hope, parenthetically, that President Obama makes full use of his wisdom). Yet, I believe the following provides a more fulsome and insightful description of what we recently experienced. This is a long quote, so bear with me, as it perfectly captures the circumstances that led up to our current predicament:\n\n\"Every now and then the world is visited by one of these delusive seasons, when 'the credit system' ... expands to full luxuriance: everyone trusts everybody; a bad debt is a thing unheard of; the broad way to certain and sudden wealth lies plain and open; and men ... dash forth boldly from the facility of borrowing.\n\n\"Promissory notes, interchanged between scheming individuals, are liberally discounted at the banks.... Everyone talks in [huge amounts]; nothing is heard but gigantic operations in trade; great purchases and sales of real property, and immense sums [are] made at every transfer. All, to be sure, as yet exists in promise; but the believer in promises calculates the aggregate as solid capital....\n\n\"Speculative and dreaming ... men ... relate their dreams and projects to the ignorant and credulous, dazzle them with golden visions, and set them maddening after shadows. The example of one stimulates another; speculation rises on speculation; bubble rises on bubble....\n\n\"Speculation ... casts contempt upon all its sober realities. It renders the [financier] a magician, and the [stock] exchange a region of enchantment.... No 'operation' is thought worthy of attention that does not double or treble the investment. No business is worth following that does not promise an immediate fortune....\n\n\"Could this delusion always last, life ... would indeed be a golden dream; but [the delusion] is as short as it is brilliant.\"[1]\n\nThat was not written by Martin Wolf of the Financial Times or Paul Gigot of the Wall Street Journal or David Brooks of the New York Times or Leon Hale in the Houston Chronicle. It was written by Washington Irving in his famous \"Crayon Papers\" about the Mississippi Bubble fiasco of 1719.\n\nIrving, mind you, had never heard of a subprime mortgage or a credit default swap or any of the other modern financial innovations that are proving so vexing to credit markets today. He had never heard of Bernie Madoff. But he understood booms propelled by greed and tomfoolery and what happens when what one old colleague called \"irrational exuberance\" is replaced by irrational fear—when what was a sure thing yields to uncertainty. Uncertainty is the ultimate enemy of decisionmaking, forcing an otherwise robust credit system into a defensive crouch. (A fellow being interviewed on television not long ago was asked what positions he would advise his clients to take to ride out the current storm. He replied \"cash and fetal.\")\n\nWith uncertainty in full fever, cash is hoarded, counterparties are viewed with suspicion and no business appears worthy of financing. The economy, starved of the lifeblood of capital, staggers and begins to weaken.\n\nSo what have we at the Federal Reserve done about it?\n\nWe could have let nature run its course. P. G. Wodehouse, my favorite comedic author, used to say that \"there is only one cure for gray hair. It was invented by a Frenchman. It is called the guillotine.\" Or we could have just ignored it and mandated that it simply not be discussed, as the Latvian government did recently by decreeing that the Security Police arrest any economists who question the security of its banks or the value of its currency (the lat).\n\nMy colleagues at the Federal Reserve and I are red-blooded Americans. We refuse to be fatalistic. (Besides, those of us who have hair have seen it turn gray this past year.) Though in normal times, central bankers appear to be the most laconic genus of the human species, in times of distress, we believe in the monetary equivalent of the Powell Doctrine: We believe that good ideas, properly vetted and appropriately directed with an exit strategy in mind, can and should be brought to bear with overwhelming force to defeat threats to economic stability.\n\nLet me go back in history once more. The basic playbook for how a central bank, as the economy's lender of last resort, deals with a financial crisis was written in the early 19th century by two men named Henry Thornton and Walter Bagehot.\n\nBagehot's prescription to counter a panic bears repeating: \"The holders of the cash reserve must be ready not only to keep it for their own liabilities, but to advance it most freely for the liabilities of others. They must lend to merchants, to minor bankers, to 'this man and that man' whenever the security is good.\"\n\nBagehot describes the response of the Bank of England to the Panic of 1825 by quoting its governor as follows: \"We lent it … by every possible means and in modes we had never adopted before; we took in stock on security, we purchased Exchequer bills, we made advances on [those] bills, we not only discounted outright, but we made advances on the deposit of bills of exchange to an immense amount, in short, by every possible means consistent with the safety of the Bank....\"[2]\n\nAll the while bearing in mind the advice rendered by Thornton, writing in 1802: \"It is by no means intended to imply, that it would become the [Central] Bank to relieve every distress which the rashness of [bankers and financiers] may bring upon them.... The relief should neither be so ... liberal as to exempt those who misconduct their business ... nor so scanty and slow as deeply to involve the general interests. These interests, nevertheless, are sure to be pleaded by every distressed person whose affairs are large, however indifferent or even ruinous may be their state.\"[3]\n\nIf you are looking for a cognitive road map of what the Fed has been up to as we navigate between the need to \"advance most freely for the liabilities of others, lend to bankers and merchants, and 'to this man and that man' whenever the security is good\" and the equally compelling need to fend off the moral hazard of relieving \"those who misconduct their business,\" you might dust off your Bagehot and Thornton.\n\nOf course, the panics of the 18th and 19th centuries were different in size and shape than those of recent times. The nature of financial crises changes with time, reacting to the dynamic contours of the economy and financial evolution. Thus we must learn from experience, augmenting the theories and models that come from the study of past remedies.\n\nI recently read Ken Follett's magnificent book World Without End.[4] It is a massive tome that runs for 1,014 pages. (I was tempted to rename it Book Without End.) It deals with the Black Plague that crippled England and Europe in the 14th century. In those days, the monks were the intelligentsia, and those who practiced medicine were sent to Oxford to learn from the theorists of ancient Greece. The nuns were the nurses. In the middle ages, women were not allowed to attend Oxford, so they learned from doing.[5] While the monks adhered to the Oxford-taught, old orthodoxy of studying the \"humors,\" of bleeding, and of invoking the dictum of fiat voluntas tua (\"Thy will be done\"), the nuns adapted their techniques according to what actually worked. The punch line of World Without End is that the community where the story takes place is spared the worst effects of the Plague by a savvy nun named Mother Caris, who applies experience and adapts established methods and theories to address the needs of the time.\n\nWe at the Federal Reserve do not believe in the economic equivalent of \"fiat voluntas tua.\" We believe in using our powers proactively. We have dusted off our Thornton and Bagehot and then some. We have been neither \"scanty nor slow\" in addressing the pathology of our economy and financial system. We have \"lent by every possible means and in modes … consistent with the safety of the bank.\" And we have made abundantly clear that despite having reduced the target range for the federal funds rate to the \"zero bound\"—the old orthodoxy—we will not shy from pursuing all practicable means available to a central bank in supporting the functioning of financial markets and stimulating the economy back to a steady state.\n\nLike Mother Caris, we have learned from the experience of crises more recent than the ancient debacles of the Mississippi Bubble or the Panic of 1825. We have studied the mistakes made by other lenders of last resort who failed to properly deploy their forces in times of distress, such as the Federal Reserve in the 1930s and the Bank of Japan in the 1990s. And we have reviewed the actions taken by others more successful, such as those of the Swedish Riksbank in response to their banking crisis of the early 1990s. Thus, starting on Dec. 12, 2007, when the base interest rate—the fed funds rate—was 4.25 percent, we began expanding our balance sheet by providing access to credit for longer terms to eligible depository institutions to alleviate funding pressures in the system.\n\nIn rapid order, over the course of a year, we took at least eight major initiatives: (1) We established a lending facility for primary securities dealers, taking in new forms of collateral to secure those loans; (2) we initiated so-called swap lines with the central banks of 14 of our major trading partners, ranging from the European Central Bank to the Bank of Canada and the Banco de México to the Monetary Authority of Singapore, to alleviate dollar funding problems in those markets; (3) we created facilities to backstop money market mutual funds; (4) working with the U.S. Treasury and the FDIC, we initiated new measures to strengthen the security of certain banks; (5) we undertook a major program to purchase commercial paper, a critical component of the financial system; (6) we began to pay interest on reserves of banks; (7) we announced a new facility to support the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by student loans, auto loans, credit card loans and loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration; and (8) at the end of November, we announced we stood ready to purchase up to $100 billion of the direct obligations of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks, as well as $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities backed by Fannie, Freddie and Ginnie Mae.\n\nAnd, as you all know, in a series of steps, the FOMC reduced the fed funds rate to between zero and one-quarter of one percent, a process which I supported once it became clear that the inflationary tide was ebbing. Simultaneously, at the request of the 12 Federal Reserve banks, and again in a series of steps, the Board of Governors lowered the rate it charges banks to borrow from our \"discount window\" so as to lower their cost of credit.\n\nAll of this has meant expanding our balance sheet. As of today, the total footings of the Federal Reserve have expanded to $1.9 trillion—an almost twofold increase from when we started in 2008. It is clear that we stand ready to grow our balance sheet even more should conditions warrant. Our options include purchasing longer-term Treasuries, expanding our holdings of mortgage-backed paper and purchasing larger amounts and different forms of asset-backed paper.\n\nYou will note that the emphasis of our activities has been on expanding the asset side of our balance sheet—the left side, which registers the securities we hold, the loans we make, the value of our swap lines and the credit facilities we have created. We feel this is the correct side to emphasize. The right side of our balance sheet records our holdings of banks' balances, Federal Reserve Bank notes or cash (currently over $830 billion) and U.S. Treasury balances.\n\nWhen the Japanese economy went into the doldrums, the Bank of Japan emphasized the right side of its balance sheet by building up excess reserves and cash, only to find that accumulation did too little to rejuvenate the system.\n\nAs I said earlier, in times of crisis many feel that the best position to take is somewhere between cash and fetal. But it does the economy no good when creditors curl up in a ball and clutch their money. This only reinforces the widening of spreads between risk-free holdings and all-important private sector yields, further braking commercial activity whose lifeblood is access to affordable credit. We believe that emphasizing the asset side of the balance sheet will do more to improve the functioning of credit markets and restore the flow of finance to the private sector. In the parlance of central banking finance, I consider this a more qualitative approach to \"quantitative easing.\" It is bred of having learned from the experience of our Japanese counterparts, much as Mother Caris learned from watching others' unsuccessful attempts at curing the Black Plague in her community of Kingsbridge.\n\nI realize that by straying from our usual business of holding plain vanilla, short-term Treasuries as assets and by shifting policy away from simple titrations of the fed funds rate, we have raised a few eyebrows. One observer has posited that we have migrated from the patron saint of Milton Friedman to enshrining Rube Goldberg.\n\nI rather like Rube Goldberg. I recall fondly the complex devises his protagonist, the felicitously named Professor Lucifer Gorgonzola Butts, would deploy to perform different tasks. If you turn to Wikipedia, you will find one of my favorites: the self-operating napkin. As described therein, it was activated when a soup spoon (Exhibit A) is raised to the mouth, pulling on a string (B), thereby jerking ladle (C) which throws cracker (D) past parrot (E), who jumps after it, tilting perch (F), upsetting seeds (G) into pail (H), whose new extra weight pulls cord (I), which opens and lights automatic cigar lighter (J), setting off skyrocket (K), which causes sickle (L) to cut string (M) and allows pendulum (N) with attached napkin (O) to swing back and forth, thereby wiping face.\n\nI assure you the Federal Reserve has not abandoned the wisdom of Milton Friedman or Walter Bagehot or any of the other established patron saints of central banking. But these are complex, trying times. Our economy faces a tough road. We are the nation's central bank and we are duty bound to apply every tool we can to clean up the mess that has soiled the face of our financial system and get back on the track of sustainable economic growth with price stability. The men and women of the Federal Reserve spend every waking hour doing their level best to perform their duty. Even if we have to deploy a little Rube Goldberg engineering to get the task done.\n\nTo be sure, we have to be very careful in deploying our arsenal. For example, we are well aware that the issuance of new Treasuries is expanding at an eye-popping pace: Net new issuance of Treasuries was $145 billion in fiscal year 2007, expanded to $788 billion in fiscal year 2008 and, according to this morning's Financial Times, will broach $2 trillion in fiscal year 2009.[6] This \"guesstimation\" is based on the pace of issuance in the first five months of this fiscal year and an $800 billion price tag for the expected fiscal stimulus package (but before a net cost is assigned to the bank proposals that will be forthcoming from the Treasury). The Federal Reserve must, of course, be very careful to avoid the perception that it is monetizing the explosion of fiscal deficits, as this would undermine confidence in our independence and raise serious doubts about our long-term commitment to price stability. This does not mean, however, that we should refrain from buying Treasuries in this time of crisis. Similarly, we must be very cautious about the dimensions of our program to intervene directly in the market for asset-backed securities, making sure that our actions are, literally, the least we must do and no more. Most important of all, we must continue to make clear that we will unwind our interventions in the market and shrink our balance sheet back to normal proportions once our task is accomplished, for this is, indeed, our unanimous and unflinching intention.\n\nI would suggest to you that some of our innovative, Rube Goldbergian contraptions have begun to work. For example, the London interbank offered rate, known by its acronym LIBOR, has come down handsomely. This is important as most variable-rate subprime and Alt-A mortgages that will be reset in the immediate future are based on LIBOR. Our purchase of government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) mortgage-backed securities initially reduced the interest rate on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages to 5.19 percent, a record low, according to Freddie Mac data that start in 1971—though the rate has floated back upward as the yield on longer term Treasuries has risen with the new issuance calendar. And our commercial paper and money market fund facilities have improved the tone of the all-important commercial paper market—not just the A1/P1 paper market, in which we have directly intervened, but also in the A2/P2 market. It has also not escaped my attention that the premium over Treasuries that investment-grade corporations pay to borrow in the open market has declined by 20 percent and by 26 percent for non-investment-grade borrowers.\n\nDespite these accomplishments, we have miles to go before we sleep.\n\nPlease bear in mind that the Federal Reserve is only one arrow in the quiver that can be deployed to restore the nation's economic vitality. The power to stimulate activity through taxing and spending the American people's money lies with the Congress of the United States. All eyes are on the stimulus package being hammered out in the Senate, and, then, in conference with the House of Representatives. This is no easy task. Our senators and congressmen and -women must find a way to give our economic engine an activating short-term jolt without encumbering or disincentivizing the entrepreneurial dynamic that has made for the long-term economic miracle that is America. Simultaneously, they must agree to the funding and structure of a revamped banking system. And, on top of all that, they must begin, now, to dig us out of the very deep hole they themselves have dug in incurring unfunded liabilities of retirement and health care obligations—programs that are already on the books but have not yet been paid for—that Pete Peterson's foundation calculates at $53 trillion and we at the Dallas Fed believe totals over $99 trillion.[7]\n\nWe are navigating uncharted, financially treacherous waters. Our fiscal authorities must carefully plot a course between the immediate needs for stimulus and the future needs of our children and grandchildren.\n\nI trust the Congress will get it right. And, I should add, I hope that they—and you—continue to bear in mind the limited powers of the Federal Reserve. I believe it vitally important that the Federal Reserve must be left alone to independently craft policies using those powers, based solely on our best judgment as to what is needed to achieve financial stability and conduct monetary policy aimed at maximizing sustainable job creation without upsetting price stability.\n\nAs a central banker, I am genetically programmed to be a worrier. In times of economic duress, there is always a temptation for political authorities to compromise the central bank. I saw this firsthand in the Carter administration with the ill-advised imposition of credit controls. This was but one instance in history.\n\nLiaquat Ahamed, a former World Bank official and CEO of the bond management firm of Fischer, Francis, Trees and Watts, has written an entertaining book, titled Lords of Finance. In it, he notes that the founder of the German Reichsbank was Otto von Bismarck. When the Reichsbank was formed in 1871, Ahamed reports, Bismarck's closest confidant, Gershon Bleichröder, is reported to have \"warned [Bismarck] that there would be occasions when political considerations would have to override purely economic judgments and at such times too independent a central bank would be a nuisance.\"[8]\n\nIt is no small wonder that the political considerations of the First World War and the impulse to override what might have been the purely economic judgments of Germany's central bank led to the hyper-inflation of the Weimar Republic and the utter destruction of the German economy. I beg to differ with Herr Bleichröder. It is more important than ever that we maintain the independence of our central bank, keeping it free from being overridden by political considerations. As the executive branch and the legislature seek to navigate our economy to safe harbor, we must minimize the impulse to let political exigencies hamper the work of the Federal Reserve. If, in the process of doing what is right and proper by confining its activity to its singular purpose, the Federal Reserve becomes a \"nuisance,\" so be it. It is important that we be left to do our job and no more.\n\nHaving ventured into fiscal matters, let me conclude with another comment on the stimulus package being debated within the legislative branch. Whatever our elected officials decide to do, it is imperative that they withstand demands for protectionism. What made the Great Depression \"great\" was the Smoot–Hawley Act, with which everyone in this audience is familiar. You may be less familiar with the Long Depression that began when a flowering of new lending institutions that issued mortgages for municipal and residential construction in the capitals of Vienna, Berlin and Paris turned a cropper and began the financial panic of 1873.\n\nIf you study that debacle, you will quickly determine that what transformed a severe global downturn into a depression that lasted 23 years was action taken by our buddy, the aforementioned Iron Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck. In 1879, he decided to abandon Germany's free trade policy. His actions were followed in quick succession by France and then by Benjamin Harrison, who won the U.S. presidential election of 1888 by running on a protectionist platform.\n\nI have been quoted as saying that \"protectionism is the crack cocaine of economics. It provides a temporary high but is instantly addictive and leads to certain economic death.\"[9] Were I not a taciturn, cautious central banker, I might have chosen my words with less constraint. As global growth slows and economic conditions in the United States toughen, our elected representatives, newly elected commander-in-chief and his agents must resist with every fiber of their beings the temptation to compound our travails by embracing protectionism. For if they fail to do so, the economic situation we are now all working so hard to overcome will seem like a cakewalk.\n\nThank you for bearing with me. I think I have said enough, if not too much. In the time-honored tradition of central bankers, I would now be happy to avoid answering any questions you might have.",

            "content": "December 18, 2008 Dallas, Texas\n\nThank you, Mr. Mayor. I am especially honored that you would take time from leading our great city to introduce me so generously and to suffer through my speech.\n\nWe have witnessed the unfolding of historic economic developments during this tumultuous year. I can think of no better groups than the World Affairs Council of Dallas/Fort Worth and the Dallas Committee on Foreign Relations with whom to discuss the year’s events and lessons learned.\n\nThe most cogent description of this year’s economic developments might best be summarized by a woman who, having just commiserated with her accountants, put it this way: “This has been like the divorce from hell: My net worth has been cut in half and I’m still stuck with my husband.” The mood and pace of the economy have shifted from near bliss to acrimony and an almost palpable sense of betrayal. Many of our fellow citizens feel trapped in an unsustainable situation.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2007, we recorded our 25th consecutive quarter of economic growth. Unemployment hit a low of 4.4 percent in March. And the stock market closed at an all-time high, with the S&P 500 Index finishing the day of Oct. 9, 2007, at 1,565. To be sure, there were some signs of friction developing from the passion of the time—most noticeably a heating up of headline inflation, which reached its peak at a 9.6 percent annualized rate in June of this year. And there were fissures developing in the superstructure of the credit markets—most noticeably in the housing market, but also on the balance sheets and business books of major creditors and various consumers. But to the outside world, all was well. Even for Bernard Madoff, who, according to Bloomberg news, was getting $50 manicures before entertaining friends and clients at the Palm in the Hamptons or on his 55-foot yacht appropriately named “Bull.”[1]\n\nIn 2008, the gears shifted. You all know the events that have transpired, and I will not belabor them. They are neatly encapsulated in the most recent data. Our gross domestic product is no longer growing, but shrank half of a percent in the third quarter. By my estimate, it is on pace to contract another annualized 4 to 5 percent in the current quarter with further contraction likely through at least the first half of next year. Industrial production is falling sharply; consumption is cascading downhill; demand has evaporated as businesses and consumers alike pull in their horns and de-lever from excess indebtedness that fueled the prior boom. Unemployment has increased to 6.7 percent at the last reading and appears to me to be headed in the direction of, and possibly past, 8 percent.\n\nBankers and other creditors, having noted that the horse long ago bolted from the confines of prudence, are now shutting the proverbial barn doors. The credit intermediation process has become dysfunctional. Once ubiquitous, credit has become quite expensive—if you can get it. As for stocks, the S&P 500 Index closed last night at 904, 42 percent off its Oct. 9 peak and has become historically and hysterically volatile.\n\nI will not venture to predict the behavioral future of our manic-depressive friend, Mr. Market. But I do know the consequences of his intemperate disposition. Faced with an unforgiving stock market and creditors that have become tighter than a new pair of shoes, businesses are doing what they can to stay profitable: As demand for their products shrinks, they are slashing every cost factor under their control to preserve their profit margins. They are demanding that suppliers cut their prices. They are addressing their cost of labor by cutting “head count.” They are delaying capital expenditures. They are watching their receivables and stretching out their payables. And they are taking every step they can to clean up their balance sheets. (If you know the basics of accounting, you will appreciate the black humor of my dear friend, Janet Yellen, the president of the San Francisco Fed. She recently quipped that when looking at the balance sheets of consumers or banks or many other companies these days, nothing on the left is left and nothing on the right is right.)\n\nAnd sadly, as we all have read, the only things adorning Mr. Madoff’s hands these days are handcuffs, and he dines in less glamorous surroundings.\n\nThere are plenty of armchair quarterbacks who now claim to have seen all this coming. Indeed, we must acknowledge that many in the financial community, including at the Federal Reserve, failed to either detect or act upon the telltale signs of financial system excess.\n\nPaul Volcker told me recently that in his day, he knew that a bank was headed for trouble when it grew too fast, moved into a fancy new building, placed the chairman of the board as the head of the art committee and hired McKinsey & Co. to do an incentive compensation study for the senior officers.\n\nPaul Volcker is the wisest of men. Yet, I believe the following provides a more fulsome and insightful description of what we recently experienced. This is a long quote, so bear with me, as it perfectly captures the circumstances that led up to our current predicament:\n\n“Every now and then the world is visited by one of these delusive seasons, when ‘the credit system’ ... expands to full luxuriance: everyone trusts everybody; a bad debt is a thing unheard of; the broad way to certain and sudden wealth lies plain and open; and men ... dash forth boldly from the facility of borrowing.\n\n“Promissory notes, interchanged between scheming individuals, are liberally discounted at the banks.... Everyone talks in [huge amounts]; nothing is heard but gigantic operations in trade; great purchases and sales of real property, and immense sums [are] made at every transfer. All, to be sure, as yet exists in promise; but the believer in promises calculates the aggregate as solid capital....\n \n“Speculative and dreaming ... men ... relate their dreams and projects to the ignorant and credulous, dazzle them with golden visions, and set them maddening after shadows. The example of one stimulates another; speculation rises on speculation; bubble rises on bubble....\n\n“Speculation ... casts contempt upon all its sober realities. It renders the [financier] a magician, and the [stock] exchange a region of enchantment.... No ‘operation’ is thought worthy of attention that does not double or treble the investment. No business is worth following that does not promise an immediate fortune....\n\n“Could this delusion always last, life ... would indeed be a golden dream; but [the delusion] is as short as it is brilliant.”[2]\n\nThat was not written by Martin Wolf of the Financial Times or Paul Gigot of the Wall Street Journal or David Brooks of the New York Times or Lee Cullum in the Dallas Morning News. It was written by Washington Irving in his famous Crayon Papers about the Mississippi Bubble fiasco of 1719.\n\nIrving, mind you, had never heard of a subprime mortgage or a credit default swap or any of the other modern financial innovations that are proving so vexing to credit markets today. But he understood booms propelled by greed and tomfoolery and what happens when what one old colleague called “irrational exuberance” is replaced by irrational fear—when what was a sure thing yields to uncertainty. Uncertainty is the ultimate enemy of decisionmaking, forcing an otherwise robust credit system into a defensive crouch. (A fellow being interviewed on television not long ago was asked what positions he would advise his clients to take to ride out the current storm. He replied “cash and fetal.”)\n\nWith uncertainty in full fever, cash is hoarded, counterparties are viewed with suspicion and no business appears worthy of financing. The economy, starved of the lifeblood of capital, staggers and begins to weaken.\n\nSo what have we done about it?\n\nWell, we could have let nature run its course. P. G. Wodehouse, my favorite comedic author, used to say that “there is only one cure for gray hair. It was invented by a Frenchman. It is called the guillotine.” Or we could just ignore it and mandate that it simply not be discussed, as the Latvian government has done recently by decreeing that the Security Police arrest any economists who question the security of its banks or the value of its currency (the lat).\n\nMy colleagues at the Federal Reserve and I are red-blooded Americans. We refuse to be fatalistic. (Besides, those of us who have hair have seen it turn gray this past year.) We believe in the power of ideas and listen carefully to our critics. And though in normal times, central bankers appear to be the most laconic genus of the human species, in times of distress, we believe in the monetary equivalent of the Powell Doctrine. We believe that good ideas, properly vetted and appropriately directed with an exit strategy in mind, can and should be brought to bear with overwhelming force to defeat threats to economic stability.\n\nLet me go back in history once more. The basic playbook for how a central bank, as the economy’s lender of last resort, deals with a financial crisis was written in the early 19th century by two men named Henry Thornton and Walter Bagehot.\n\nBagehot's prescription to counter a panic bears repeating: \"The holders of the cash reserve must be ready not only to keep it for their own liabilities, but to advance it most freely for the liabilities of others. They must lend to merchants, to minor bankers, to 'this man and that man' whenever the security is good.\"\n\nBagehot describes the response of the Bank of England to the Panic of 1825 by quoting its governor as follows: \"We lent it … by every possible means and in modes we had never adopted before; we took in stock on security, we purchased Exchequer bills, we made advances on [those] bills, we not only discounted outright, but we made advances on the deposit of bills of exchange to an immense amount, in short, by every possible means consistent with the safety of the Bank....\"[3]\n\nAll the while bearing in mind the advice rendered by Thornton, writing in 1802: \"It is by no means intended to imply, that it would become the [Central] Bank to relieve every distress which the rashness of [bankers and financiers] may bring upon them.... The relief should neither be so ... liberal as to exempt those who misconduct their business ... nor so scanty and slow as deeply to involve the general interests. These interests, nevertheless, are sure to be pleaded by every distressed person whose affairs are large, however indifferent or even ruinous may be their state.\"[4]\n\nIf you are looking for a cognitive road map of what the Fed has been up to as we navigate between the need to \"advance most freely for the liabilities of others, lend to bankers and merchants, and 'to this man and that man' whenever the security is good\" and the equally compelling need to fend off the moral hazard of relieving \"those who misconduct their business,\" you might dust off your Bagehot and Thornton.\n\nOf course, the panics of the 18th and 19th centuries were different in size and shape than those of recent times. The nature of financial crises changes with time, reacting to the dynamic contours of the economy and financial evolution. Thus we must learn from experience, augmenting the theories and models that come from the study of past remedies.\n\nI have just finished reading Ken Follett’s magnificent book World Without End.[5] It is a massive tome that runs for 1,014 pages. (I was tempted to rename it Book Without End.) It deals with the Black Plague that crippled England and Europe in the 14th century. In those days, the monks were the intelligentsia, and those who practiced medicine were sent to Oxford to learn from the theorists of ancient Greece. The nuns were the nurses. In the middle ages, women were not allowed to attend Oxford, so they learned from doing.[6] While the monks adhered to the Oxford-taught, old orthodoxy of studying the “humors,” of bleeding, and of invoking the dictum of fiat voluntas tua (“Thy will be done”), the nuns adapted their techniques according to what actually worked. The punch line of World Without End is that the community where the story takes place is spared the worst effects of the Plague by a savvy nun named Mother Caris, who applies experience and adapts established methods and theories to address the needs of the time.\n\nWe at the Federal Reserve have dusted off our Thornton and Bagehot and then some. We have been neither “scanty nor slow” in addressing the pathology of our economy and financial system. We have “lent by every possible means and in modes … consistent with the safety of the bank.” And just two days ago, we made clear that despite having reduced the target range for the federal funds rate to between zero and 0.25 percent—the old orthodoxy—we will not shy from pursuing every practicable means of supporting the functioning of financial markets and stimulating the economy back to a steady state by employing new techniques that fit the current circumstance.\n\nLike Mother Caris, we have learned from the experience of crises more recent than the ancient debacles of the Mississippi Bubble or the Panic of 1825. We have studied the mistakes made by other lenders of last resort who failed to properly deploy their forces in times of distress, such as the Federal Reserve in the 1930s and the Bank of Japan in the 1990s. And we have reviewed the actions taken by others more successful, such as those of the Swedish Riksbank in response to their banking crisis of the early 1990s. Thus, starting on Dec. 12 of last year, when the base interest rate was 4.25 percent, we began expanding our balance sheet by providing access to credit for longer terms to eligible depository institutions to alleviate funding pressures in the system.\n\nIn rapid order, over the course of a year, we took at least eight major initiatives: (1) We established a lending facility for primary securities dealers, taking in new forms of collateral to secure those loans; (2) we initiated so-called swap lines with the central banks of 14 of our major trading partners, ranging from the European Central Bank to the Bank of Canada and the Banco de México to the Monetary Authority of Singapore, to alleviate dollar funding problems in those markets; (3) we created facilities to backstop money market mutual funds; (4) working with the U.S. Treasury and the FDIC, we initiated new measures to strengthen the security of certain banks; (5) we undertook a major program to purchase commercial paper, a critical component of the financial system; (6) we began to pay interest on reserves of banks; (7) we announced a new facility to support the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by student loans, auto loans, credit card loans and loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration; and (8) at the end of November, we announced we stood ready to purchase up to $100 billion of the direct obligations of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks, as well as $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities backed by Fannie, Freddie and Ginnie Mae.\n\nAnd, as you all know, in a series of steps, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) reduced the fed funds rate, a process which I fully supported once it became clear that the inflationary tide was ebbing. Simultaneously, and again in a series of steps, the Board of Governors lowered the rate it charges banks to borrow from our “discount window” so as to lower their cost of credit. That rate now rests at 0.5 percent.\n\nAll of this has meant expanding our balance sheet. When I finished Ken Follett’s book last Friday night, the total footings of the Federal Reserve had expanded to $2.254 trillion—an almost three-fold increase from when we started the year. And I believe we made it quite clear in our press release after Monday and Tuesday’s meeting of the FOMC that we stand ready to grow our balance sheet even more should conditions warrant. For example, we will expand purchases of mortgage-backed securities, should we feel such purchases would be productive.\n\nYou will note that the emphasis of our activities has been on expanding the asset side of our balance sheet—the left side, which registers the securities we hold, the loans we make, the value of our swap lines and the credit facilities we have created. We feel this is the correct side to emphasize. The right side of our balance sheet records our holdings of banks’ balances, Federal Reserve Bank notes or cash (currently over $830 billion) and U.S. Treasury balances.\n\nWhen the Japanese economy went into the doldrums, the Bank of Japan emphasized the right side of its balance sheet by building up excess reserves and cash, only to find that accumulation did too little to rejuvenate the system.\n\nAs I said earlier, in times of crisis many feel that the best position to take is somewhere between cash and fetal. But it does the economy no good when creditors curl up in a ball and clutch their money. This only reinforces the widening of spreads between risk-free holdings and all-important private sector yields, further braking commercial activity whose lifeblood is access to affordable credit. We believe that emphasizing the asset side of the balance sheet will do more to improve the functioning of credit markets and restore the flow of finance to the private sector. In the parlance of central banking finance, I consider this a more qualitative approach to “quantitative easing.” It is bred of having learned from the experience of our Japanese counterparts, much as Mother Caris learned from watching others' unsuccessful attempts at curing the Black Plague in her community of Kingsbridge.\n\nI realize that by straying from our usual business of holding plain vanilla Treasuries as assets and by shifting policy away from simple titrations of the fed funds rate, we have raised a few eyebrows. One observer has posited that we have migrated from the patron saint of Milton Friedman to enshrining Rube Goldberg.\n\nI rather like Rube Goldberg. I recall fondly the complex devises his protagonist, the felicitously named Professor Lucifer Gorgonzola Butts, would deploy to perform different tasks. If you turn to Wikipedia, you will find one of my favorites: the self-operating napkin. As described therein, it was activated when a soup spoon (Exhibit A) is raised to the mouth, pulling on a string (B), thereby jerking ladle (C) which throws cracker (D) past parrot (E), who jumps after it, tilting perch (F), upsetting seeds (G) into pail (H), whose new extra weight pulls cord (I), which opens and lights automatic cigar lighter (J), setting off skyrocket (K), which causes sickle (L) to cut string (M) and allows pendulum (N) with attached napkin (O) to swing back and forth, thereby wiping face.\n\nI assure you the Federal Reserve has not abandoned the wisdom of Milton Friedman or Walter Bagehot or any of the other patron saints of central banking. But these are complex, trying times. Our economy faces a tough road. We are the nation’s central bank and we are duty bound to apply every tool we can to clean up the mess that has soiled the face of our financial system and get back on the track of sustainable economic growth with price stability. The men and women of the Federal Reserve spend every waking hour doing their level best to perform their duty. Even if we have to deploy a little Rube Goldberg engineering to get the task done.\n\nSome of our innovative contraptions have begun to work. For example, the London interbank offered rate, known by its acronym LIBOR, has come down handsomely. This is important as most variable-rate subprime and Alt-A mortgages that will be reset in the immediate future are based on LIBOR. Our purchase of government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) mortgage-backed securities has reduced the interest rate on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages to 5.19 percent, a record low, according to Freddie Mac data that start in 1971. And our commercial paper and money market fund facilities have improved the tone of the all-important commercial paper market.\n\nYou cannot read a great deal into the initial response to an FOMC meeting. The markets need time to digest the signals being sent, especially when we are declaring a new regime change. That said, I found it encouraging that one of my favorite, well-run companies, Disney, was able to issue $1 billion in five-year notes yesterday, priced to yield 4.7 percent—some 30 basis points lower than most mavens on Wall Street had expected. If we are successful, issuers of corporate debt should see the cost of debt reduced over time. According to this morning’s Wall Street Journal, the credit-default swaps index, which tracks the cost of insuring against the default of high-quality, investment-grade bonds, has fallen 16 percent in the past three days.[7] So, so far, so good.\n\nYet despite these accomplishments, we have miles to go before we sleep.\n\nPlease bear in mind that the Federal Reserve is only one arrow in the quiver that can be deployed to restore the nation’s economic vitality. The power to stimulate activity through taxing and spending of federal monies lies with the Congress of the United States, and all eyes are on the fiscal stimulus package that will be worked out by the new president and the legislative branch. As a representative only of the monetary authority, I will refrain from commenting on the business of the fiscal authorities. With one exception: Whatever they decide to do, it is imperative that they withstand demands for protectionism—action that is within their purview as collectors of tariffs and writers of trade legislation. What made the Great Depression regrettably “great” was the Smoot–Hawley Act, with which everyone in this audience is familiar. You may be less familiar with the Long Depression that began when a flowering of new lending institutions that issued mortgages for municipal and residential construction in the capitals of Vienna, Berlin and Paris turned a cropper and began the financial panic of 1873.\n\nIf you study that debacle, you will quickly determine that what transformed a severe global downturn into a depression that lasted until 1896 was action taken by Chancellor Otto von Bismarck in 1879 to abandon Germany’s free trade policy.

As world economic growth slows and economic conditions in the United States toughen, our elected representatives and newly elected commander-in-chief must resist with every fiber of their political beings the temptation to compound our travails by embracing protectionism. For if they fail to do so, the economic situation we now are working so hard to overcome will seem like a cakewalk.\n\nWith that cautionary note, I think I have said enough, Mr. Mayor. If you wish, I would be happy to take questions from the audience—as long as everybody keeps their shoes on.",

            "content": "November 4, 2008 Grapevine, Texas\n\nI am a little uncomfortable speaking to cattlemen. It is true that we have a family ranch in East Texas—a few thousand acres straddling the Titus and Franklin county lines. We don’t run a feed yard, but we did run up to 600 mother cows in our pastures until it finally dawned on us that cows graze on dollar bills. We never made a profit from those animals and now simply lease our grazing land to others. So I admit to knowing slim to none about cattle. We do own a couple dozen Longhorns, however. For the past few years, we have bred them with a pure, red Simmental bull that weighs in at over a ton and have covered our costs by selling the offspring. Our bull’s name used to be Mr. T. In honor of Alan Greenspan, I had Mr. T re-registered as Irrational Exuberance.\n\nWhen Chairman Greenspan retired, we had a farewell dinner for him at the Dallas Fed. We had his picture taken alongside a huge poster of our handsome breeder and gave him a lifetime pass to come visit our ranch at any time to pet him. About a week later, I received a copy of the photo on which Alan had inscribed: “Richard—Irrational Exuberance is truly a lot of bull.”\n\nSimmentals are thought to be docile and easy to manage. Yet they are also known for their extreme muscle patterns and leanness. When a 2,000-plus-pound Simmental bull in a pasture full of Longhorn cows becomes … uh … exuberant … he is nearly impossible to tame until his energies are spent. An extremely muscular economy and robust financial system like that of the United States is not all that dissimilar. Academics and armchair pundits may think them easy to manage. Yet, despite all the advances in economic theory and risk management techniques, when the economy and financial markets get too headstrong and frisky, they are hard to rein in.\n\nEconomists like to say that one of the purposes of a central bank like the Federal Reserve is to “tame the animal spirits of the economy,” employing monetary policy to keep the nation on the path to sustainable, noninflationary growth. One of the greatest of Federal Reserve chairmen, William McChesney Martin, once said that the job of the Fed is “to take away the punch bowl just as the party gets going.” As I speak to you today, we are in the midst of experiencing the consequences of the failure to take away the punch bowl and of allowing the exuberant “animal spirits” of our economy to get out of hand. We must never allow this to happen again. But first we must deal with the situation at hand. This is what I wish to speak to you about today: our economic predicament and what the Federal Reserve, the nation’s central bank, is doing about it.\n\nFirst, a little background. Let me read to you what I consider to be the most insightful description of what we have just witnessed.\n\nThis was not written in a recent issue of the Wall Street Journal or the Dallas Morning News or the Amarillo Globe-News, the Oklahoman, or the Albuquerque Journal. It was written by Washington Irving in 1719 in his famous “Crayon Papers” about the speculative disaster known as the Mississippi Bubble.\n\nI am pretty confident that Washington Irving had never heard of a subprime mortgage or of Countrywide Financial, of a credit default swap or Lehman Brothers, multisector collateralized debt obligations or AIG, or any of the other modern financial innovations and agents that have proven so vexing to credit markets and financial stability. But he understood booms propelled by greed and tomfoolery and what happens when the “animal spirits” of the markets are allowed to run amok. He did not need a modern-day figure like Warren Buffett to warn that we must “beware of geeks bearing formulas.” For common sense told him that eventually, the “short but brilliant” phenomenon of irrational exuberance bursts and is most often replaced by irrational fear. What was a sure thing yields to uncertainty; uncertainty undermines decisionmaking; and the confident decisionmaking that is needed to sustain the economy retreats into a defensive crouch. Counterparties come to be viewed with suspicion. No business appears worthy of financing. Cash is hoarded. The economy, starved of the lifeblood of capital, staggers and begins to weaken.\n\nA fellow interviewed on television the other day was asked what positions he would advise viewers to take to ride out the current period of uncertainty. He replied: “Cash and fetal.” It was a clever description of a debilitating pathology. You can’t grow an economy when financiers are curled up into a ball, clutching dollars for fear they might lose them. With the credit markets frozen, growth gives way to recession, and confidence is displaced by fear. This Sunday, the New York Times reminded us that James Madison said, “The circulation of confidence is better than the circulation of money.” The global economy has been waylaid by a crisis of confidence.[1]\n\nIn late September, the CEO of one of the nation’s largest retailers called me and told me of a remarkable conversation his buyers had just had with their biggest supplier, the Chinese. In preparing for the upcoming buying season, this retailer—from whom a hefty portion of American families buys clothes, shoes, accessories and housewares—had been told earlier this year by his Chinese suppliers that their asking price for women’s apparel would be 8 to 10 percent higher than last year and shoes would be 15 percent higher, reversing more than a decade of price deflation in those consumer products. The retailer had budgeted corresponding price increases in his stores to begin this winter. Yet at that meeting, the buyers were told that the Chinese suppliers would not only not levy the price increases they had previously insisted upon, but would even discount from 2007’s prices as long as the buyers were creditworthy.\n\nAs the year progressed, there had been a clear pattern emerging in our economy among our nation’s businesses. After a ferocious rush upward of prices—not just of commodities and raw materials, but also of intermediate and finished inputs produced by increasingly expensive Chinese and other foreign labor—producers of goods and services were pursuing a textbook strategy to sustain their top lines and protect their margins: They were clamping down on the costs by cutting personnel, running tighter inventories and supply lines, and cutting every controllable cost. And they were pushing rising input costs into their price structure as much as the market would bear. Thus, we saw a rash of announcements of planned price increases for everything from chemicals to diapers to soft drinks to beer to airline fares to rail shipment prices to cereals to feed. Even purveyors of electronic services, like Bloomberg, raised prices by roughly 6 percent in midsummer. Architects and engineering and other services firms were doing likewise.\n\nThis microeconomic behavior was reflected in the macroeconomic numbers. Consumer price indexes rose, and even the “core” indexes that central bankers use to sort out the underlying signal from the background noise about inflation were coursing upward. In June, headlines of major newspapers announced that the month-on-month rate for consumer prices had risen at an annualized 9.6 percent, while the core rate was reported out at 3.4 percent. Less dramatically, but nonetheless ominously, the year-over-year rise in headline consumer price inflation (as measured by the PCE) in July was 4½ percent and the core rate, 2½ percent. This is why I was so cautious about endorsing rate cuts: We were at risk of the worst of economic fates—a slowing economy accompanied by expectations of rising prices, more popularly known as “stagflation.” Even as the majority of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted to lower the benchmark interest rate, and even as we unanimously undertook measures to counter emerging strains on the credit system, the statements that accompanied our policy initiatives repeatedly stressed the balance of risks between growth and inflation. After our meeting of June 25, the FOMC issued a statement to the effect that “although downside risks to growth remain … the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have risen.” After our August meeting, we noted that “inflation has been high … and some indications of inflation expectations have been elevated,” adding, however, that “the Committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year.” We repeated that concern in our release on September 16, noting that “inflation has been high” and “the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain.”\n\nCattle feeders appear to have been equally concerned. I note that your press release of August 7 expressed deep concern about the impact of rising corn prices, which had reached $7.65 a bushel on June 27 before their descent to the present level of $4.\n\nAs evidenced by the experience of the retailer I cited earlier, the impetus for rising prices came to a grinding halt as the credit crisis took grip and confidence evaporated. As the credit market congealed, inflationary momentum froze in its tracks. As October approached, it became increasingly clear that smart businesswomen and -men no longer had the option of seeking to protect their top and bottom lines by seeking price increases for their goods and services. The only option before them quickly became that of running their businesses by aggressively tightening their head count of employees, more passionately seeking to cut other costs, and more closely scrutinizing and reining in their capital expenditures. Economists recognize this as “procyclical behavior.” It forms a toxic brew when combined with a credit crisis. Just as irrational exuberance causes economies to overshoot on the upside, behavioral adaptations driven by uncertainty and fear and credit constriction exacerbate the downside.\n\nSo what has the Federal Reserve done to counter this phenomenon? Remember that we have a limited role. We are the central bank of the United States, not the fiscal authority. We have available a limited number of tools. But we have been deploying them aggressively.\n\nAgain, some historical context. The basic manual for a central bank’s response to a panic was written in the early 19th century by two Englishmen, Walter Bagehot and Henry Thornton. Bagehot’s prescription to counter a panic was as follows: “The holders of the cash reserve must be ready not only to keep it for their own liabilities, but to advance it most freely for the liabilities of others. They must lend to merchants, to minor bankers, to ‘this man and that man’ whenever the security is good.” He wrote of how, during the Panic of 1825, the Bank of England lent “by every possible means and in modes … never adopted before.”[2] Also bearing in mind the advice of Thornton, who in 1802 wrote that “it is by no means intended to imply that it would become the [Central] Bank to relieve every distress which the rashness of [bankers and financiers] may bring upon them…. The relief should neither be so … liberal as to exempt those who misconduct their business … nor so scanty and slow as deeply to involve the general interests. These interests, nevertheless, are sure to be pleaded by every distressed person whose affairs are large, however indifferent or even ruinous may be their state.”[3]\n\nCentral bankers are generally considered the most laconic genus of the human species. Yet, in response to this crisis, the Federal Reserve reacted like Bagehot on steroids. We have not quite lent “to this man and that man.” But beginning with the announcement on December 12 of last year of our term auction facility, we have reached deep into our tool kit to “lend by every possible means and in modes … never adopted before.” We have been neither “scanty” nor “slow.” In rapid order, the Federal Reserve has stretched out the terms with which we lend to bankers; accepted new forms of collateral; broadened access to our lending window to securities dealers and one particular insurance company—AIG—whose failure was deemed by the Federal Reserve Board to present a risk to the financial system; opened a window for financing commercial paper; backstopped money market mutual funds; and, recognizing that we are inextricably interwoven with a global economy, established swap lines to help meet the dollar-funding needs of 14 central banks, ranging from the European Central Bank and the Bank of England to the Banco de México and the Singapore Monetary Authority, the total of which now aggregates to hundreds of billions of dollars. And our staff and policymakers have provided substantial intellectual input into activities of other regulators, such as the FDIC and the Treasury, as they develop innovative means and modes of recapitalizing the banking system, dealing with the mortgage crisis and restoring economic growth.\n\nYou can see the size and breadth of the Fed’s efforts to counter the collapse of the credit mechanism in our balance sheet. At the beginning of this year, the assets on the books of the Fed totaled $960 billion. Today, our assets exceed $1.9 trillion. I would not be surprised to see them aggregate to $3 trillion—roughly 20 percent of GDP—by the time we ring in the New Year. The composition of our holdings has shifted considerably. Previously, almost 100 percent of our holdings were in the form of core holdings of U.S. Treasuries; today, less than a third are. The remainder consists of claims deriving from our new facilities.\n\nThis combination of measures, together with an effective fed funds rate of less than 1 percent, is unprecedented. We believe they are a necessary antidote to what ails the economy and a needed impetus for the restoration of confidence.\n\nBut we also know that there are limits to what the central bank can do. Our efforts must be complemented by fiscal policy and by initiatives undertaken by other regulators. And we also know that it will take time before confidence is re-established.\n\nI don’t know how many of you have read Virgil’s Aeneid. It tells the story of the epic voyage in which Aeneas is tested by all kinds of temptation and fury, dispossession and defeat, torment and, eventually, triumph as he crosses stormy seas to seek the city from which Rome will eventually be founded. One of the great tests of Aeneas’ will comes when he attempts to cross the Tuscan Sea. Juno, the queen of the gods, asks Aeolus, the god of the winds, to whip up the mother of all storms to stop Aeneas’ fleet. Neptune, the god of the sea, comes to the rescue, and as described by Virgil, he saves the day. He: “calms the heaving seas, putting the clouds to rout and bringing back the sun … clearing a channel through the deadly reefs, his chariot skimming over the cresting waves on spinning wheels to set the seas to rest.”\n\nAnd Virgil goes on to declare: “Just as, all too often, some huge crowd is seized by a vast uprising, the rabble runs amok, all slaves to passion, rocks and firebrands flying … but then, if they chance to see a man among them, one whose devotion and public service lend him weight, they stand there, stock-still with their ears alert as he rules their furor with his words and calms their passion. So the crash of the breakers all fell silent once [Neptune], gazing over his realm under clear skies, flicks his horses, giving them free rein, and his eager chariot flies.”\n\nIf it were only so easy to turn around an economy that is now geared to the downside with a kind of turbulent ferocity that seems to equal, if not better, the powerful tailwinds that drove both the United States economy and the rest of the world on its upward slope of growth. Such growth was the product of exuberant financial markets running “amok, all slaves to passion, rocks and firebrands flying” in the pursuit of the ever greater returns made possible by the end of the Cold War, the death of Mao, the triumph of capitalism, the onset of globalization, and the speed with which the Internet and modern technology have accelerated financial calculation and economic development.\n\nA reader of the Aeneid will recall that after the storm that I just described, “Aeneas puts in with a bare seven warships saved from his whole fleet.”[4] And this is but Book One of Virgil’s epic poem. Aeneas’ ultimate victory does not come until 11 books later.\n\nThere is no modern counterpart to a Neptune who will rise from the depths and “chariot spinning … set the seas to rest.” The task of restoring the credit markets, instilling confidence and righting our economy ship will take many hands. I have described to you the initiatives undertaken by your central bank—by the Federal Reserve—to calm the tempest that is upon us. Complementary action must now be undertaken by the fiscal authorities—by the Congress in cooperation with a new president who will be elected by the American people today. It was not to distract you that I spoke of the Aeneid. Despite the efforts of the Fed, the hope that comes with a new presidency, and what will hopefully be responsible and carefully calibrated fiscal initiatives for the Congress, I believe we have an epic challenge ahead of us. We are navigating the mother of all financial storms. We will certainly come out of it with a lesser number of ships than we entered it with, for we cannot and should not “relieve the rashness of distress that financiers” and other imprudent decisionmakers “have brought upon themselves.” And we know that that reduced fleet will face many challenges before it reaches the safe harbor of prosperous economic growth.\n\nBut this much I know: We have been here before and we have overcome our problems. We are a nation of risk takers. Often we confront storms of our own making. We falter. We get blown off course. We lose some of our ships. But we never give up. We are a resilient people. We always come roaring back, recovering from our setbacks with an even more extreme muscle pattern and a leanness that would put that hearty bull that roams our pasture in Mount Vernon to shame. You don’t have to be irrationally exuberant to know that that is what makes America unique.\n\nAnd always will.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "October 12, 2008 Washington, D.C.\n\nThank you, Bill [Rhodes].\n\nI have been wondering why Charles Dallara asked me to join this distinguished panel of presenters this morning.\n\nPerhaps it was because in the convenient lexicon of the press I am viewed as among the FOMC's most outspoken inflation \"hawks\" and have of late made clear that the dynamics of price movements have shifted and been overpowered by the implosion of the credit mechanism.\n\nOr perhaps it is because I hail from the strongest economic region within the United States. Texas has an economy that is larger than India's, created roughly 30 percent of all private sector jobs in America last year, expects to have employment growth of around 1.5 percent this year despite the slowing of the national and international economies into which it sells, is the country's second-largest manufacturing center, is the largest exporting state and was singled out by the Financial Times on Friday as enjoying \"the best\" economic situation in the U.S.\n\nSo Charles may have wanted to present me as a curiosity. Or he may have wanted to remind those of you who in your trips to the United States never venture outside the narrow Boston–New York–Washington corridor that this vast American economic machine still has pistons that are pumping and entrepreneurs and financiers who refuse to be trapped in the conventions of the past and instead view the current markets' turmoil as an opportunity that occasionally presents itself through the painful but inexorable process of \"Schumpeterian creative destruction.\"\n\nOr, perhaps more likely, it was simply because he may have confused me with my prestigious central banking namesake, Stanley Fischer, a towering intellect and most clever man.\n\nIt was Stan Fischer who a couple of years ago at Jackson Hole quipped that there are three kinds of economists: those that can count and those that cannot.\n\nSome would say that Stan Fischer's little quip might best apply today to bankers and regulators who, in the zeal to quantify risk and econometricize decisionmaking, abandoned rudimentary math and forgot the basics that anchor credit and money and banking.\n\nLet me read you a description of fiduciary amnesia, written by one of the shrewdest of financial market observers:\n\nThat was not written by Martin Wolf of the Financial Times or Paul Gigot of the Wall Street Journal or David Brooks of the New York Times, or their counterparts at LeMonde or the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung or the Straits Times or Reforma or O Globo or the Daily Mail and Guardian in Johannesburg (whose headline today was \"Without Real Leadership, We Face Financial Disaster\"). It was written by Washington Irving in his famous \"Crayon Papers\" about the Mississippi Bubble fiasco of 1719.\n\nIrving, mind you, had never heard of a subprime mortgage or an SIV or a credit default swap or other modern financial innovations that are proving so vexing to credit markets today. But he understood booms propelled by greed and tomfoolery and what happens when what one old colleague called \"irrational exuberance\" is replaced by irrational fear: What was a sure thing yields to uncertainty; uncertainty is the ultimate enemy of decisionmaking; and the decisionmaking that ordinarily keeps the credit system robust retreats into a defensive crouch. (A fellow being interviewed on television the other day was asked what position he would advise his clients to take to ride out the current storm, and he replied: \"Cash and fetal.\")\n\nWith uncertainty in full fever, cash is hoarded, counterparties are viewed with suspicion, and no business appears worthy of financing. The economy, starved of the lifeblood of capital, staggers and begins to weaken.\n\nSo what have we done about it?\n\nThe Federal Reserve is the central bank of the most powerful and dynamic economy in the world. It is the lender of last resort for that colossal economy. The behavior of the classic lender of last resort in the current circumstance is also etched in the history books, and it is well worth remembering.\n\nHenry Thorton and Walter Bagehot articulated it early in the 19th century.\n\nBagehot's prescription to counter a panic bears repeating: \"The holders of the cash reserve must be ready not only to keep it for their own liabilities, but to advance it most freely for the liabilities of others. They must lend to merchants, to minor bankers, to 'this man and that man' whenever the security is good.\"\n\nBagehot describes the response of the Bank of England to the Panic of 1825 by quoting its governor as follows: \"We lent it … by every possible means and in modes we had never adopted before; we took in stock on security, we purchased Exchequer bills, we made advances on [those] bills, we not only discounted outright, but we made advances on the deposit of bills of exchange to an immense amount, in short, by every possible means consistent with the safety of the Bank....\"[1]\n\nAll the while bearing in mind the advice rendered by Thornton, writing in 1802: \"It is by no means intended to imply, that it would become the [Central] Bank to relieve every distress which the rashness of [bankers and financiers] may bring upon them.... The relief should neither be so ... liberal as to exempt those who misconduct their business ... nor so scanty and slow as deeply to involve the general interests. These interests, nevertheless, are sure to be pleaded by every distressed person whose affairs are large, however indifferent or even ruinous may be their state.\"[2]\n\nIf you are looking for a cognitive road map of what the Fed has been up to as we navigate between the need to \"advance most freely for the liabilities of others, lend to bankers and merchants, and 'to this man and that man' whenever the security is good\" and the equally compelling need to fend off the moral hazard of relieving \"those who misconduct their business,\" you might dust off your Bagehot and Thornton.\n\nCentral bankers are ordinarily considered the most laconic genus of the human species. Not so in a time of crisis. I would submit to you that the Federal Reserve under the chairmanship of Ben Bernanke has wasted no time and left no stone unturned in addressing the current crisis. We have \"lent by every possible means and in modes we have never adopted before\" \"consistent with the safety of the Bank.\" We have neither been \"scant\" nor \"slow.\"\n\nYesterday, Roger Coles walked you through the rapid-fire steps we have taken at the Federal Reserve. Phillip, throw up that chart of the growth of our balance sheet. This picture says a lot: The assets on the books of the Fed are now close to $1.6 trillion. In December of last year, they were only $890 billion.\n\nYou will notice the dramatic difference in the composition of the assets held by the System. At the beginning of the year, we were almost 100 percent in Treasury securities; now \"other assets\" and \"term auction credit\" represent roughly one-third or some $500 billion in our total assets. This reflects what I consider one of the most significant strides taken to address perhaps the most debilitating pathology of a credit crunch. I refer to \"rollover risk.\" When counterparties are unwilling to engage one another for fear that regardless of price, a borrower will not be able to roll over a loan to another source of funds, the credit markets cease to operate. Suppose Charles, for example, thinks Richard is creditworthy. But the certainty that Bill might replace that loan to Richard when it comes due to Charles is suspect. Charles becomes reluctant to lend to Richard in the first place for fear that Richard will be unable to roll over his debt to Charles to Bill. The result is that no one lends to Richard at all, even if he is creditworthy in Charles' eyes. Thus our recent initiatives to provide a backstop for funding banks, primary dealers and commercial paper issuers. By providing a backstop source of funding, the Fed seeks to lower or eliminate rollover risk. Charles no longer worries about what Bill might think of Richard as a borrower because he knows he will be repaid by Richard's going to the Fed for a loan.\n\nThe Fed will do whatever it needs to do to be a credible backstop in support of the credit system.\n\nIt is traditional for Reserve Bank presidents and governors to proffer only their personal views and never speak for any other member of the Federal Open Market Committee. This morning, I am casting that convention aside. I believe I can safely speak for us all when I tell you that the Federal Reserve will continue to explore every avenue and consider every option to see the credit market through the current crisis, consistent with the safety of the System. We will provide the leadership called for by the Daily Mail and Guardian of Johannesburg and others.\n\nOf course, we know that we cannot go it alone. At home, our work must complement the work of the fiscal authorities as they seek to recapitalize the banking system and reconfigure our regulatory system. Thus we are working hand-in-glove with the Treasury, which has facilitated the growth of our balance sheet, enabling us to keep credit flowing in the face of the seizing up of interbank lending and of the commercial paper market.\n\nWe live in a globalized world, and as evidenced by the expansion of swap lines with nine of our counterparts and by the recent coordinated rate cut, we will continue to explore appropriate policy responses that can be enacted without detriment to others but instead to the benefit of all.\n\nIn the end, there is only so much that the Federal Reserve or any other central bank, even acting in unison with each other and with fiscal authorities, can do. I believe we can and we will restore order to the credit markets and that the fiscal authorities led by Secretary [Henry] Paulson and the Congress will engineer an appropriate recapitalization of the banking system in a manner that does not kill the goose that lays the golden eggs of the practice of capitalism that has made for the powerful economic machine of America. That does not mean that we can undo in short order the damage that has been done to confidence on Main Street—in the real sector of the economy where jobs are created and innovation and progress are realized. Contrition for the misbehavior of the financial sector and the realization that we have lived for too long too high on the ambrosia of money compliantly advanced by overly eager lenders at home and abroad—that, to go back to Washington Irving, our \"delusion\" could not \"always last\"—will likely be manifest in a painful period of adjustment and subpar or even negative growth for some time, probably well into 2009. But properly managed, a task to which my colleagues at the Federal Reserve and I will devote every ounce of our collective energy, need not—indeed must not—result in the dire scenarios being bandied about by economics Cassandras.\n\nAs we navigate our way through this difficult patch, we would do well to heed the advice of Marcus Nadler, a former chief of the Foreign Division of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors:\n\nThese four propositions—what is now known as \"Old Doc Nadler's Remedy\"—were not written for some political campaign or for a recent edition of USA Today. They were crafted some 70 years ago by one of the world's foremost economists to counter the down-in-the-mouth pessimism that gripped our financial system in the 1930s. They serve as a gentle reminder that we should never discount the unfailing ability of the American entrepreneur and thoughtful government officials to solve our most complex problems—even those that plague us today.",

            "content": "September 25, 2008 New York City\n\nThank you, John [Partlan].\n\nI haven’t been in these rooms for some 30 years. The Downtown Association used to be a haunt of some of the partners of the firm where I started my career—the venerable, now 190-year-old and still-thriving private bank, Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. I went to work there for the legendary Robert Roosa after graduating from Stanford Business School in 1975. He and the partners of Brown Brothers taught me money and banking and provided me the analytical training and insights that made for whatever successes I have had, including the investment performance record cited by John in his kind introduction.\n\nMost important, it was Mr. Roosa, God rest his magnanimous soul, who set me on the path that led to the Federal Reserve. He had played a signal role in the development of the New York Fed’s operations and later served with great distinction as President Kennedy’s undersecretary of the Treasury before joining Brown Brothers. During his long career, he mentored many good men—from Paul Volcker, who was his deputy at Treasury, to Mike Long, who became a key general partner at Brown Brothers and whom I am very honored to see here tonight, to a few lesser characters like me. All of us take pride in having been members of a small fraternity that was very much “sub-Roosa.”\n\nThat was then; this is now. Little about the fraternity I currently belong to—the Federal Reserve System—is sub-rosa, or secretive. Chairman Ben Bernanke has just completed two days of testimony before Congress, and I doubt anything I can say tonight will be any more comprehensive than what you heard from him these past two days. So I will make little effort, neither in this speech nor the Q&A that follows, to review or amplify upon the chairman’s testimony. Instead, I am going to focus my comments predominantly on monetary policy, the bedrock mission of the Federal Reserve System. As always, the views I will express this evening are my own and not those of any other participant in the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve.\n\nAs I was preparing this speech against the background of recent fast-moving events in the financial markets, I couldn’t help but think of Bob Dylan’s song “It’s Alright, Ma (I’m Only Bleeding).”[1] One of my favorite lyrics in that song is: “Money doesn’t talk, it swears.” Financial institutions have been bleeding, and the markets have been cussing up a blue streak lately. So I thought I would share with you tonight some perspectives on where we have been, what we have done, where we are now and where this might lead us.\n\nLet me begin by reviewing where we have been on monetary policy by dispatching the excessive attention that has been given to my dissenting votes this year on the Federal Open Market Committee. The morning after our meeting on Sept. 16, the headline in the business section of the world’s most important daily … The Dallas Morning News … read as follows: “Bernanke, Fed Colleagues Decide to Keep Rates Steady; Even Dallas’ Fisher Concurs.”[2]\n\nThe less parochial among you may have read Hong Kong’s Asia Times on Sept. 18, which had this gem of an analysis on the meeting: “Like an old-time cowboy, [Ben Bernanke]’s got all his ‘little doggies’ back into the pen. Dallas Federal Reserve [Bank] president Richard Fisher, the leader of an anti-Bernanke insurgency calling for higher interest rates to fight inflation since spring, fell in line this time with the rate hold [at 2 percent], making the statement unanimous.” To which the writer appended: “… if the choice was between the health of the economy and the restoration of Bernanke’s authority, it seems that the economy got the nasty end of the stick.”[3]\n\nI am not sure what was meant by that last clause about the end of the stick. But I can tell you this: Ben Bernanke, whose authority as chairman has never been in question, is no cowboy. And I am no “doggie” (though our family does own a handsome herd of Longhorns and a fine breeding bull named, incidentally, Irrational Exuberance; I consider these noble animals, so the term in itself is hardly insulting). Nor am I a member of, yet alone a leader within, what some cynical writer imagines is an “anti-Bernanke insurgency.” I am a member of a group of earnest policymakers, which includes the chairman, that places the health of the economy and the proper conduct of monetary policy above any personal interests or intrigue.\n\nThe FOMC met on Sept. 16, the day after the Lehman announcement and as the New York Fed was wrestling with AIG. As we prepared to meet, fed funds were trading at up to 5 and 6 percent, triple the targeted level, even as the open market desk was injecting prodigious amounts of liquidity into the system. And we met on the eve of some $89 billion in one day’s withdrawals from money market funds. The problem was clearly not the fed funds rate target. A rate cut was not, and is not, the cure for an economy where many banks cannot expand their balance sheets, or must shrink their balance sheets, because of capital constraints. The case for a rate rise seemed both less urgent and potentially disruptive given the clear and present danger of an imploding financial system and the considerable downside risks to the economy should that implosion occur. This “little doggie” entered the pen not because Ben Bernanke or anybody else had herded me there. Rather, I did so because I felt, as others at the table did, that holding the fed funds rate steady at 2 percent was the right thing to do while our colleagues at the New York Fed and at the Treasury turned to dealing with the risk of AIG and other choke points in the markets.\n\nThis does not mean that I or anybody else at the table have abandoned our primary job as central bankers to deliver upon our mandate to provide the monetary conditions for maximum sustainable noninflationary employment growth. We do our duty when we vote with that mandate in mind, even if it means not satisfying the pundits or market operators who wish for us to accommodate their more immediate needs.\n \nI take this charge very seriously, as does every other member of the committee. If the author of that Asia Times article, or any of you, wishes to place in perspective my votes—or those of Charlie Plosser of the Philadelphia Fed or Bill Poole of St. Louis, or those last year of the Boston Fed’s Eric Rosengren or the Kansas City Fed’s Tom Hoenig or any other member of the FOMC[4]—he might benefit from reading Andrew Roberts’ magnificent new book, Masters and Commanders. It tells the story of Churchill and Roosevelt and their top aides as they sought to negotiate the Second World War. Sir Alan Brooke was Churchill’s equivalent to Roosevelt’s Gen. George Marshall. On more than one occasion, Brooke openly refused to fall into line with Churchill, and often articulated arguments that differed from the consensus of the war cabinet meetings. A critic considered him an insurgent and told him so, saying that it would appear that he might not hold the prime minister in highest regard. To which Brooke replied: “I adore him tremendously … but the day that I say I agree with him when I don’t is the day he must get rid of me because I am of no use to him anymore.”\n\nIn a committee such as the FOMC, the best service a member can render is to show his or her affection for the institution, its members and especially for its chairman by calling it as he or she sees it.\n\nIn my view, the situation this year has been as follows:\n\nSince the beginning of the year, I have been worried about the efficacy of reducing the fed funds rate given the problems of liquidity and capital constraints afflicting the financial system. As I see it, the seizures and convulsions we have experienced in the debt and equity markets have been the consequences of a sustained orgy of excess and reckless behavior, not a too-tight monetary policy.\n\nThere is no nice way to say this, so I will be blunt: Our credit markets had contracted a hideous STD—a securitization transmitted disease—for which lowering the funds rate to negative real levels seemed to me to be not only an ineffective treatment, but a palliative and maybe even a stimulus that would only encourage further mischief.\n\nI was and I remain skeptical that lowering the fed funds rate is the most effective antidote for such a pathology, given that, in my book, rates held too low, too long during the previous Fed regime were an accomplice to that reckless behavior. A fed funds rate of around 3 1/2 percent—that was the level at which I began to stray from “the pen”—did not appear to me to be the principal problem, particularly with commodities prices soaring and incipient inflation coming to our shores from demand-pull pressures and rising labor costs in the countries that we use to source the inputs needed to run our manufacturing base and stock the shelves of our retail stores.\n\nI would be happy to go into further detail during the Q&A period about my concerns this past year for the risk of inflation “pass through.” Again, that was then; this is now. But we certainly were seeing it continue as we entered the third quarter, even as the financial crisis was reaching a crescendo. On Sept. 5, almost at the moment the Treasury announced it had taken Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship and the stock market had once again turned dyspeptic from fears of an economic slowdown, the customers of Georgia-Pacific woke up to find a note dated Sept. 4: “Please be advised that the Georgia-Pacific Consumer Products LP is increasing prices up to 10% with selected items increasing more than 10%, on commercial towel, tissue, napkins, wipers, dispensers, soap, aire [sic], and specialty products due to continued cost increases…. Orders shipped on or after Monday, December 1, 2008, regardless of order date will be invoiced at the new prices.”[5]\n\nOn the day that notice was mailed to Georgia-Pacific’s customers, oil had fallen to $106.23 after peaking at $145.66 on July 11, the dollar had rallied to $1.42 on the euro from $1.60 over the same period, and the benchmark Goldman Sachs commodity index overall had come off a July high of 473.97 to close at 374.55. I single out this interestingly timed notice to illustrate a broader phenomenon of well-managed companies determined to preserve their margins after years of upward-creeping cost pressures, despite the retrenchment of commodity prices. I suspect that this risk, while muted, still lingers. Only days after the FOMC met on the 16th, FedEx, for example, announced that its “U.S. express-delivery unit would raise its shipping rates by an average of 6.9 percent in January.”[6]\n\nBut I digress. The problem that has been ailing capital markets and, by extension, the economy has not been the fed funds rate. It has been and remains risk aversion and uncertainty about counterparty risk and capital adequacy.\n\nIt may be useful to review the emergency initiatives taken by the Federal Reserve as the hemorrhaging patient was being rushed into the ER:\n\nFirst, there was the administration of various emergency efforts to stabilize the situation. The Federal Reserve created three new facilities: the TAF, or term auction facility; the TSLF, or term securities lending facility; and the PDCF, or primary dealers credit facility. We used these improvised devices to intravenously inject liquidity in amounts and on terms that were unprecedented.\n\nWe worked with other “ERs” as we saw the infection spread and take on global dimensions. We established and expanded our swap lines with the Europeans and the British and the Swiss and the Canadians and the Japanese (and just this week with the Norwegians, Swedes, Aussies and Danes). Together, these central banks injected sizable amounts of liquidity to satisfy dollar demand in their respective home markets.\n\nAnd, working with the Treasury, we cauterized certain blood vessels that seemed to burst almost spontaneously and threaten the system, like Bear Stearns and AIG and debilitated money market funds.\n\nMeanwhile, other responders were at work—from the Federal Housing Administration, to the Federal Home Loan Banks, to the Securities and Exchange Commission, to the Treasury, to the Congress. As they collectively sought to contain the disease, they applied emergency treatments ranging from extending lines of credit, to constricting short selling, to easing capital requirements, to putting the government-sponsored enterprises into conservatorship, to negotiating the dissolution of iconic financial institutions, to backstopping money market mutual funds, to passing bills to support these various piecemeal efforts.\n\nThese various efforts were reactive responses. They were as deliberately and thoughtfully crafted and administered as they could be under the unusual and exigent circumstances. But they were necessarily ad hoc. We were fast reaching a point where a more comprehensive, coordinated solution was needed. Given that you are all New Yorkers, I am sure you read the Sunday Times. So I am not divulging any great secrets in saying that Ben Bernanke, a careful student of the Depression of the 1930s and other crises, had long been warning the secretary of the Treasury and others that a more comprehensive solution might be required.[7] He pressed especially hard on this front after the events surrounding our last FOMC meeting. You know the outcome: A proposal by the Treasury was sent to Congress Saturday, and both the secretary and the chairman have been reviewing the merits of the proposed “package” with Congress these past few days.\n \nSo now a proposal has been made to isolate and quarantine the principal source of this debacle, the toxic mortgage and mortgage-related bacteria, by placing it under a TARP, or “Troubled Asset Relief Program.” All parties have recognized that this proposal entails risk, not least of which is that every lobby will seek to sweep other festering sores—from credit card receivables to auto loans—under the TARP. The president of the United States summed up the sense of urgency last night in no uncertain terms.\n\nAs you heard Chairman Bernanke testify, the key strategy in the Treasury proposal is that by gathering these distressed assets under the TARP and auctioning them off in a prudent manner, something closer to a “hold to maturity” price, rather than a panic-based “fire sale” price, can be determined. This process would give banks a basis for marking their portfolios to a more realistic level, allowing them to clear the air and stabilize their capital base. By removing diseased mortgages and curing the credit market patient, creditors can begin getting back to the business of funding commerce and economic growth.\n\nOne could make the argument that isolating the infected assets that were the most active sources of contagion is a necessary but still insufficient condition for restoring a healthy credit system. That argument would suggest that once the TARP, or whatever comes of it, passes through the political process and debilitating toxic assets are removed from balance sheets, we must next go about buttressing the equity side of the balance sheets of the system’s key agents. I believe that after something along the lines of the Treasury proposal is enacted, that is the next task. The Street and the authorities must put their shoulders to the wheel, and I will be interested in hearing your ideas about how this might be accomplished.\n\nEven before tackling the task of cementing capital adequacy, we need to bear in mind that the TARP places one more straw on the back of the frightfully encumbered camel that is the federal government ledger. Other off-balance-sheet liabilities were already in place before Washington took on additional burdens from the reorganization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and whatever we realize—which may, after all is said and done, be a positive return—from the liquidation of collateralized loans made through the Fed to Bear Stearns and AIG, and now the Treasury’s discharging of “x” dollars of mortgage-related securities for which there is presently no palpable market. (I say “x” because under the proposal made, the taxpayers’ outlay is not $700 billion; it is the difference between $700 billion and the return earned on that $700 billion investment.)\n\nForemost among the existing liabilities are some $13 trillion in unfunded Social Security benefits and Medicare obligations already promised to the people but as yet unfunded, an obligation that the Dallas Fed staff estimates at a present value of over $80 trillion.[8] The former comptroller general of the United States, David Walker, estimates the Medicare deficit to be less, only $34 trillion, so let’s work with his less-excitable numbers. With everything including Social Security and Medicare properly accounted for, Mr. Walker estimates that “as of September 30, 2007, the federal government was in a $53 trillion fiscal hole, equal to $455,000 per household and $175,000 per person.”[9]\n\nWe are deeply submerged in a vast fiscal chasm. Which begs the question: Is it possible, now that so many distinguished senators and congressmen are proclaiming their concerns for the price tag of the Treasury proposal and are ardently defending the interests of the taxpayer, that one of the outcomes of this debate will be that Congress, which alone has the power to tax and spend, will finally face up to the task of squaring the nation’s books?\n\nJohn Plender, writing in the weekend edition of the Financial Times, reminded us of economist Hyman Minsky’s dictum that fiscal activism and last-resort loans more often than not set the stage for serious inflation.[10]\n\nWhether or not Minsky is right depends in part on those who have the power to tax and spend the people’s money. They can use this crisis as a call to arms for coming to grips with our fiscal predicament, or they can punt by asking our children and their children to do what they cannot bring themselves to do. Or, just as awful, they can turn to the Fed to print their way out of their dilemma and encumber future generations of Americans with the debilitating burden of debased money.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I was blessed with the birth of a grandchild. Her name is Anna. For Anna’s sake, I pray that those with the power of the purse will take the high road and come to grips with our nation’s fiscal predicament either through deft management or enlightened fiscal initiatives. And I pray that Congress will resist the temptation to hinder the Federal Reserve’s independence and instead allow us to implement policy unencumbered by political exigency. For if they don’t and the people who deliberate monetary policy in the Fed’s hallowed halls are no longer able to do their Alan Brooke-ian best to tell it like it is and act accordingly to provide the monetary conditions for sustainable noninflationary growth, I will fear for Anna’s future.\n\nVery serious matters are before us, and they require the most thoughtful responses from all parties concerned—from the Fed, to the administration, to the ultimate representatives of the people, the Congress. Mind you, this is not the first time that the capital markets have forgotten that there are consequences to indiscriminate behavior. Consider this description of what we have experienced:\n\nThat was not recently written by Martin Wolf of the Financial Times or David Brooks of the New York Times or Paul Gigot of the Wall Street Journal. It was written by Washington Irving in his famous Crayon Papers about John Law’s “Mississippi Bubble” fiasco of 1719. Irving had never heard of a subprime mortgage or an Alt-A loan, an SIV, a CDS, a CLO or a CMO. But he understood booms propelled by greed and tomfoolery and busts born of fear, and that these underlying forces are deeply rooted in human DNA.\n\nIf this is a DNA issue, perhaps no financial system—no matter how enlightened its central bank or sophisticated its regulatory architecture or wise its Congress or executive—can prevent nature from running its course. Still, our country is the most advanced in the world. We have been at the forefront of innovation and structural advancement in biology and science and technology, in culture and management and commerce and countless other fields. We must continually strive to be at the forefront of figuring out how to corral the “little doggies” that are the financial markets’ animal spirits in a way that encourages them to work their magic of underwriting prosperity and yet discourages their straying from the pasture. This is not an easy thing to do. But if we want to preserve our way of life, and do what is right for Anna and future generations of Americans, we must get it done.\n\nLet me wrap up this long monologue by going back to the origins of this club. At times like this, it is easy to become melancholy and bitter and cynical. This club, the Money Marketeers, was founded by Marcus Nadler, one of John’s and my predecessors at the Federal Reserve who was there “at the creation.” You will remember that Nadler put forth four simple propositions to counter the intellectual paralysis and down-in-the-mouth pessimism that gripped the financial industry after the Crash of ’29:\n\nThis became known as “Old Doc Nadler’s Remedy,” and for my part, it is spot on. Every red-blooded American should keep it in mind.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "September 4, 2008 Houston, Texas\n\nThank you, Doug [Foshee, CEO of El Paso Corp.]. I am most grateful for this opportunity to address the Greater Houston Partnership. This great metropolis houses a key branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, overseen most ably by Admiral Bob Smith from that splendid Michael Graves-designed building on Allen Parkway. I want to tell you that that building was delivered on time and on budget thanks to Leo Linbeck’s good work and Bob’s watchful eye. Of course, we would expect no less from a former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. I salute you, Leo. The great entrepreneur Norman Brinker told me when I first came to Texas in 1973 that “it is nice to be important. But it is more important to be nice.” Leo is the embodiment of being both nice and important. And so is Bob. Thank you both for your exemplary leadership.\n\nThis is an exciting period in American history. We have two able presidential candidates vying for the highest office in the land during a period of enormous economic challenges. The central bank of the United States—the Federal Reserve—is chartered by Congress to conduct monetary policy so as to engender maximum sustainable noninflationary growth. To do so, the Federal Reserve and its officials and staff must remain scrupulously nonpartisan and nonpolitical. When you enter the temple of the Fed, you check your political affiliation and interests at the door. We favor no party and no candidate. We treasure our independence.\n\nI say this up front so as to politely ask you to pardon me if I dodge any questions you might be tempted to ask about the presidential campaign at the conclusion of these comments.\n\nThat said, I thought I would sketch out for you the circumstances the new president and the new Congress will be confronted with when they are elected.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I spoke in Aspen and described the current domestic economic predicament like this: The housing market has yet to find its bottom; credit markets remain tempestuous; creditors are tightening their standards; consumers and businesses are battening down the hatches and reefing in their sails. The prices of Chinese and other emerging country labor and inputs we have come to depend on have been rising; business margins are being squeezed; consumers are suffering from declining real incomes; savers and investors are confronted with negative real rates of return. These are hardly fortuitous circumstances.\n\nIn Admiral Smith’s parlance, having sailed the economy along for years in a tranquil following sea, we are now navigating Force 10 conditions. To be sure, on the growth front we have managed to make better headway than most everyone expected under the circumstances: To everyone’s surprise, our $14 trillion economy grew at a 3.3 percent annualized rate last quarter, meaning that the American economy produced almost $29 billion more in the second quarter than it did in the first.\n\nThat said, looking off the bow, I see nothing on the horizon that would lead me to conclude anything different than what I articulated in Aspen: The data received since then on personal consumption expenditures, real capital expenditures and construction show the third quarter off to a weak start, although yesterday’s manufacturing numbers were a nice surprise on the upside. I think it is very likely we will suffer anemic growth for the current and perhaps the next couple of quarters. But I want to lay down a caveat: What bothers me is that this is a widely held view. I learned over the years as a market operator that the consensus view is almost always wrong. American entrepreneurs and business leaders are ingenious in figuring out how to overcome obstacles that might befall lesser capitalists. Still, I think it likely that our movement through the muck and the flotsam and jetsam of the credit and housing debacle will be sluggish, and it may take some time into 2009 for us to get the economy back up to a snappier cruising speed.\n\nAs to the inflation outlook, there appear to me to be even odds that one of two scenarios will obtain.\n\nThe first calls for slowing domestic and economic growth to dampen the inflationary surges we have seen of late. This scenario banks heavily on the recent price reversals in energy and other commodity prices and takes succor in the fact that, but for the oil patch and construction sectors in Texas and elsewhere on the Gulf Coast, domestic wage pressures have been tame, mitigating the odds of what inflation watchers most fear: a self-reinforcing wage–price spiral in response to upward pressures in the cost of living.\n\nThe other probable scenario assumes that rather than passing through as a “one-off\" event, there is some spreading of the inflationary pressures we have been experiencing. According to this scenario, the inflationary scare we experienced of late infiltrates the mindset of consumers and business operators alike, and they begin to change their behavioral patterns accordingly.\n\nIn my most recent series of speeches, I have enumerated several examples of the actions taken by a wide swath of businesses to recover their costs by raising prices. In the interest of time, I will not repeat them here. All you need to do is look at Tuesday’s New York Times article titled “Despite Lower Oil Prices, Little Relief for Consumers” to get the picture.[1] After companies have had their margins gutted by dramatic rises in their cost of goods sold, one can envision them being a little skeptical about the durability of recent price retrenchments in the commodities markets and taking advantage of every opportunity to buy protection from being victimized again. Under this scenario, consumer prices prove sticky on the downside.\n\nThe jury is still very much out as to which scenario will obtain. The most recent inflation reports are not particularly encouraging. On Aug. 29, the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) numbers for July were released. The “headline” inflation rate for the PCE came in at an annualized pace of 7.9 percent. This is better than the 9.3 percent we saw for June. And yet if you link May, June and July together, but for the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, you have to go back to 1982 to find a worse three-month stretch for consumer price inflation.\n\nMoreover, if you break out the component details of the PCE, you would notice that of the expenditure-weighted items—there are over 200 items in the basket whose price movements are tracked—85 percent increased in price, with 48 percent rising faster than a 5 percent annualized rate, up from 33 percent in the June period.\n\nAs every economist worth his or her salt will tell you, you have to be careful to sort out the “noise” from the “signal” in all these data to discern the underlying trend. Taking all our various price measures together (both PCE-based and CPI-based), here is what you can say: It is pretty clear that trend consumer price inflation has accelerated over the past few months.\n\nLess clear, however, is the duration of this acceleration. The thing you have to constantly bear in mind is that data represent the past. It is history, not the future. To discern the future course of economic phenomena you have to keep your ear to the ground, in addition to consulting econometric models.\n\nI repeat that while it seems pretty clear that economic momentum is slowing, the jury is out on whether lesser momentum will be sufficient to translate into relief on the price front over the intermediate to longer term. In East Texas parlance, “It might could, but it mightn’t”; it most definitely has not thus far.\n\nIn formulating my input into the upcoming discussions of the Federal Open Mark Committee (FOMC), I am going to be listening very closely to my contacts in the business community as to their perception of the direction of prices while carefully studying the entrails of the models and other econometric tools employed by our able economists at the Dallas Fed and the Board of Governors.\n\nI will say this much and then shift to more felicitous subjects: Within the aviary that is the FOMC, I am viewed by outside analysts and by the press as being the “most hawkish” on inflation, sometimes referred to in [Larry] McMurtry-esque language as “The Lonesome Hawk.” Neither I nor what commentators describe as my “less hawkish” or “dovish” colleagues feel that this convenient nomenclature does justice to our approach to policy. The one thing we do not wish to become are pigeons. So we work double time, overtime to try to deliver on our mandate to provide the monetary conditions for maximum sustainable noninflationary employment growth. And doing so means we must be wary of risks on both the growth and inflation fronts.\n\nSo much for fowl language. I want to turn now to some good news that also comes from a close analysis of the recent numbers—a ray of sunshine, if you will, peeping through the dark clouds. I refer to our growing prominence as a global service provider.\n\nAmericans are champion exporters. In 2007, we sold $1.1 trillion in goods to satisfy foreign consumers, ranging from one of our biggest exports, semiconductors, to soybeans to airplanes to pharmaceuticals. The shipment of goods is vital to the future of Texas, as we are the largest exporting state, having recently pulled ahead of California, in no insignificant part due to the great Port of Houston. But a close study of the numbers makes clear that as we move forward in time, our nation’s comparative advantage in global markets increasingly lies in the service sector.\n\nIn 2007, Americans sold nearly $500 billion in services to foreign customers, more than the combined total of the two next largest service exporters, Germany and Great Britain. The most recent data show service exports are running about 17 percent ahead of last year’s pace and have been growing at a rate of 12 percent per annum for the past five years.\n\nHoustonians and Americans are top-notch competitors in most all high-value-added service sectors. In industrial engineering, U.S. exports exceed imports by nearly 24 to 1. Our ratio in the distribution of film and television programs is 13 to 1. In both medical care and in construction services, areas where Texas hits the ball out of the park, the edge is 10 to 1. We have an 8 to 1 edge in information processing. I could lull you to sleep with a recitation of each and every service sector, so let me just say that in over three-quarters of all trade categories classified by the Department of Commerce, the United States maintains significant comparative advantage relative to the rest of the world. We run a trade surplus in services.\n\nThe consensus view among leading economists is that growth of the global economy is slowing presently. Yet, even if the global economy slows in the immediate future, over time we will continue to benefit from our comparative advantage in providing services. Let’s look at the two countries that everyone seems to be focusing on: China and India.\n\nOur chief economist at the Dallas Fed, Michael Cox, calculates that China will add $116 billion to global demand for medical care in 2008. India will contribute an additional $25 billion in demand. Together, these two countries’ increase in demand for medical care in just one year will be more than four times that of the United States.\n\nOr look at recreational services. In the U.S., we add roughly $23 billion a year in spending on recreation. In China, one year’s added demand comes to $79 billion, and in India, $16 billion.\n\nWe have enormous capacity to sell into those and other more-developed markets American services that are head and shoulders above the competition. Why? Because we have the right stuff. Over a third of our workers have earned at least a college degree, tops in the world. A good many of them hold services jobs and are among the world’s most productive service workers.\n\nHerein lies a challenge that goes above and beyond monetary policy. If we want to keep growing the United States’ share of the global market for services, we must resist the siren call of protectionism. We cannot expect to have our service-sector team rack up points on the trade scoreboard if we pull out of the game and retreat into a defensive crouch in the other sectors of our economy. I hope both presidential candidates and both political parties will bear this in mind.\n\nWe must always remember that the ultimate source of our comparative advantage in providing high-value-added services and brain-intensive goods like semiconductors and pharmaceuticals to the rest of the world is the three-pound machine that sits on top of every American’s shoulders—the American brain.\n\nWe cannot succeed in a globalized world without superior educational institutions. You all have heard the arguments a million times and I won’t repeat them here, except to ask you to consider two aspects of the clear need to plow an enormous amount of money and effort into continually making for the best-educated workforce in the world.\n\nFirst, if Texas is to become the brightest star in the American economic sky, we simply must drive our universities to higher levels of excellence. As Houstonians, you should be proud of the fact that Rice was ranked by last year’s U.S. News and World Report survey as 17th in the nation for overall excellence, above Vanderbilt and University of California–Berkeley. As Texans, you should be less proud that, according to that survey, six campuses in the University of California system outranked the University of Texas at Austin, which U.S. News ranks at 47th. Or that Texas A&M ranked 64th, SMU 66th and Baylor 76th.[2]\n\nThere are numerous other measures of “brain prowess,” and on almost all fronts the point is clear: While we can be justifiably proud of Rice, we should be making every effort to bring our other academies up to the highest standards in order to secure our future. By almost any measure, we are falling short on this front, be it the number of faculty members Texas universities have in the National Academy of Sciences or the National Academy of Engineering or the Institute of Medicine or as winners of Nobel prizes or—that great arbiter of academic excellence—as claimants to federal R&D dollars.\n\nDavid Daniel, the president of UT Dallas, likes to point to an exemplary study done by economists with BankBoston in 1994 about MIT alumni.[3] That study showed that more than 4,000 high-value-added companies employing 1.1 million people were founded by MIT grads. In 1994 those companies grossed $232 billion. By contrast, in 2005, Dallas–Fort Worth, a region responsible for one-third of our state’s economic output, reported a gross metropolitan output of $285 billion. The Austin–Round Rock MSA reported a gross metropolitan product of $66.2 billion that same year. In 1994, MIT alums produced approximately as much as the entire DFW metroplex 10 years later and three and a half times as much as our state capital.\n\nTexas is a mighty economic machine. We cannot expect to stay mighty in a knowledge-driven, service-sector-powered world unless we see to it that our major universities achieve the standards of a Rice University or an MIT.\n\nThe second point is that we cannot expect to do so unless we develop a sensible approach to immigration. Most of the time, the discussion of immigration focuses on the poor and huddled masses that wish to come to our economic shores, like my parents did 70 years ago, as did the ancestors of most every person in this room. But there is another side to the immigration issue that is very much as important.\n\nConsider two illustrative facts: Fifty-five percent of the engineering master’s degrees awarded by major Texas universities went to foreign citizens. Seventy-five percent of engineering Ph.D.'s from those same universities also went to foreigners.\n\nNow consider this: These same skilled immigrants must wait up to 10 years for a green card when they are lucky enough to get an H-1B visa first. While the U.S. is busy turning away the best and the brightest, other governments are thinking proactively about how to take more of them in. The Australian government recently announced they will seek to increase their pool of skilled foreign workers by 30 percent. The European Union is considering a skilled immigration program similar to our H-1B visa; some of the original EU nations are already benefiting from influxes of skilled migrants from the new member nations in Eastern Europe.\n\nSo where do you think these wonderful students that we have educated in universities subsidized by taxpayer money and private endowments are going to go?\n\nThis is nonsense. It is as though we went out and spent hundreds of millions of dollars to drill exploratory wells and then when they were proven, simply gave all the oil or gas away to others. We need an immigration policy that encourages the cream of the crop of foreigners to stay here and help us build our economy and stay ahead of the competition in the high-value-added service sector.\n\nOne of my more erudite friends puts it this way: Pretend the U.S. is an NFL franchise. Everyone wants to play on our team; we could have every first- and second-round draft choice we wanted if the rules allowed it. And yet we give them away to other teams.\n\nI hope you good Houstonians will do all you can to influence the lawmakers of our land to redress our nonsensical immigration policy.\n\nEnough serious stuff. I want to come back to Leo and Bob. Remember I told you that they brought our branch building here in on time and on budget? Well, my wife, Nancy, and I are doing a major remodeling of our house. On Sept. 8, Nancy and I will celebrate our 35th wedding anniversary. I can honestly tell you that in those 35 years—three and a half decades—we have never—not once—had an argument … that I haven’t lost. This record remains intact with the rebuilding of our house. So, Leo and Bob, you could win one for the Gipper just this once if you would share your secrets with me. I promise to keep them to myself.\n\nThank you all. I would be happy to avoid answering your questions now.",

            "content": "August 19, 2008 Aspen, Colorado\n\nI am grateful for the invitation to speak to such an impressive gathering of technologically savvy people. I want you to know what a tremendous sacrifice it is to be here in the Rockies, instead of sitting at home like a hard-boiled egg in the steamy summertime cauldron of Texas. Mark Twain famously said that everybody talks about the weather but nobody does anything about it. Well, I have done something about it: I’ve come to Aspen. Bret [Swanson], thank you for inviting me. And thank you for that kind introduction.\n\nLast night I had the pleasure of talking about China at dinner with a group of you. Today, I would like to talk about the issues we face at the Fed as we work to create the monetary conditions for achieving sustainable, noninflationary employment growth in very uncertain times. But first, given the interests of this group, I want to tip my hat to information technology and quickly tell you about the IT side of the Federal Reserve.\n\nMost of what you read about the Federal Reserve focuses on monetary policy, which I will turn to shortly. Yet, in addition to setting the base interbank lending rate, known as the fed funds rate, the Fed operates a pretty complex business.\n\nWe meet the banking system’s need for cash. The 12 regional banks store currency and coins in massive vaults and use 132 machines to count and sort currency at a rate of 86,000 bills an hour, day in, day out. We clear checks. Last year, we processed 5.8 billion paper checks and 4.1 billion electronically imaged checks. We moved $5 trillion per day between financial institutions to settle their accounts.\n\nAnd we extend credit. Over the past eight months, we have lent considerable amounts through the discount window and other facilities created to provide liquidity and alleviate strains in the financial system. At its peak, credit outstanding approached $180 billion and currently stands at about $165 billion. This is on top of our currency swap agreements designed to provide more than $60 billion of liquidity to European banks. In addition, we have made available large amounts of Treasury securities to primary dealers.\n\nNone of this would be possible, of course, without sophisticated information technology and systems. As Bret mentioned, in addition to serving as president of the Dallas Fed, I chair the IT Oversight Committee for the Conference of Presidents of the 12 regional banks.\n\nLet me give some idea of the dimensions of our Systemwide IT needs. Our mainframe processing power totals nearly 9,000 millions of instructions per second, or MIPS. We have in excess of one petabyte, or one quadrillion bytes, of data storage capacity. Across the System, we have about 4,500 servers and 24,000 desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices. Our national networks support nearly 3,000 high-bandwidth circuits that reach about 1,500 end points, both internal locations and external customers. To keep this technology functioning, we employ 3,600 IT professionals. Our annual spend on IT is roughly $1 billion.\n\nTo say that it is a special pleasure to spend a couple of days surrounded by IT professionals—who aren’t trying to sell something—would be an understatement. I look forward to learning a lot more from you these next few days than you will likely learn from me today.\n\nLet me turn to the current predicament facing monetary policy makers. Keep in mind that what I am about to say reflects my own opinions and experiences. I do not speak for the Federal Reserve or the other members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), our main policymaking group.\n\nWe are in the midst of a fierce correction from a prolonged period of indiscriminate behavior in the credit markets, a surfeit of home building, a global avalanche of cheap labor and correspondingly cheap imports, and other unsustainable financial and economic activity. If you were a yachtsman, you would say that we sailed the economy along in a following sea for a long time; now we are navigating force 10 seas. Everyone is battening down the hatches and reefing in their sails. Worldwide, creditors are tightening their standards and consumers and businesses are correcting their courses.\n\nThe correction in the housing market has yet to find its bottom. Credit markets remain tempestuous. The price of the Chinese and other emerging-country labor we came to rely upon to hold costs down is rising; the cost of imported goods, and of goods and services overall, is rising too, driven in part by demand from the newly rich consumers in those emerging countries. U.S. consumers are being hammered by declining real income, U.S. savers and investors are being squeezed by negative real interest rates and U.S. companies’ business margins are under pressure.\n\nAll these forces have conspired to constrain economic growth. My best guess is that our $14 trillion economy grew faster than the 1.9 percent annualized rate initially reported for the second quarter, thanks to exports and prudent inventory management. But I expect U.S. economic growth will decelerate to a snail’s pace, if not completely grind to a halt, in the second half of this year. Indeed, we may see the slowdown extend into 2009 as the excesses that drove the housing markets unwind before the economy can again gear up to cruising speed. Then, as 2009 unfolds, it is quite possible that the economy will resume a more normal growth trajectory.\n\nCongress charged the Federal Reserve with creating the monetary conditions for sustainable, noninflationary employment growth. We are sorely aware of the present risk to job growth. At the same time, we have to be keenly aware of the consequences of our actions for inflation. We have a dual mandate—the operative words modifying growth are “sustainable” and “noninflationary”—and we are duty bound to deliver upon it.\n\nA clear-eyed observer would, I believe, look at the facts and say the Fed has done its job on the growth front. The FOMC has taken aggressive action to stabilize the credit markets and has not been shy about cutting the fed funds rate. It would likely appear to that clear-eyed observer that these initiatives have paid dividends: The U.S. economy has continued to grow. In fact, but for the fourth quarter of 2007, the numbers have thus far been better than what most pundits expected, though everyone and his sister, including me, contemplates a more anemic outlook going forward. (The old hedge fund manager in me tells me that when everyone and his sister shares a view—when there is consensus on the street—it is usually wrong, but I still think the growth outlook for the next quarters is unpleasant.)\n\nAs for the “noninflationary” part, the observer would take heart from the recent price reversals that have taken place in the oil and commodity markets. But her brow might knit up a bit as she dissects the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data released Thursday. That report said that consumer inflation increased at an annualized rate of 10.3 percent in July and that, year over year, consumer prices have risen 5.5 percent. She might also note that roughly 25 percent of our Consumer Price Index is a theoretical construct to capture the cost of shelter called “owner’s equivalent rent” and conclude that the effective cost pressure on consumers and business operators is actually higher than the headline number.\n\nAnd our clear-eyed woman would note that even as economists remove energy and food from the CPI to eliminate the “noise” of those volatile items, the underlying, or “core,” inflation measure is also drifting upward on a year-over-year basis, indicating that inflationary pressures are spreading beyond energy and food prices. Were she an economics wonk, she might further note that the “trimmed mean” CPI that the Cleveland Fed calculates—another way to parse the data to look for the underlying trend—posted a one-month gain of 7.2 percent, something it has only done once before, in 1991.\n\nIt is important to remember, however, that the July CPI is history. Data are the past. The question that the FOMC must wrestle with is: What will occur on the inflation front going forward?\n\nIn an op-ed in the August 7 issue of the Financial Times—perhaps the world’s most renowned newspaper before the recent surge of the National Enquirer—one of the world’s most respected economists, Martin Feldstein, wrote that the Federal Reserve “is prepared to gamble that the weakness in U.S. employment and the general decline in economic activity will prevent a wage-price spiral without further increases in the interest rate. If food and energy prices remain at today’s level and wage costs do not accelerate, the overall consumer price index inflation will decline by next year….”[1]\n\nWere I rewriting that paragraph, I would purge the word “gamble” because the thought of any semblance of gambling at the Fed is contrary to my experience. The FOMC—the 16 dedicated individuals whom I have the great privilege of working with under the leadership of Ben Bernanke—does not gamble. To be sure, we are aware any economic outcome is subject to probabilities and chance. But the verb “gamble” carries the connotation of squandering away hard-earned capital. The earnest men and women who make up the FOMC have no intention of squandering the bedrock capital of a central bank: the confidence the public places in our hands to keep inflation at bay while we work to bolster economic growth and restore the financial system.\n\nThat said, you do not have to be a gambler to subscribe to Dr. Feldstein’s scenario. The markets in commodities, like those of stocks and bonds, are manic-depressive mechanisms and overshoot on the upside as well as on the downside. One could reasonably deduce from recent price reversals in oil and food prices that they overshot on the upside and that their price run-up was a one-off development. If you subscribe to this argument, you envision a process not unlike that of a python digesting dinner: It visibly moves through the system, creating some moments of discomfort—in this case, a temporary inflationary bulge—but is processed in reasonable time and done with.\n\nBecause this is a serious speech, I will refrain from telling you about my neighbor in Dallas who had a pet python named Julius Squeezer. But I will tell you that I learned much from watching that python over the years: He was an efficient processor of most anything he swallowed, although there were times when he had to be taken to the vet to be treated for indigestion.\n\nIt is tempting to deduce from the recent reversal of commodity prices—in particular, energy prices save coal—that the discomfort manifest in headline inflation numbers that we broached in July is passing through the system and is being squeezed out by slowing economic growth. This is certainly a plausible economic scenario. Weakness in the U.S. and other advanced economies will mitigate inflationary pressures, rendering them a temporary inconvenience. In the parlance of central bankers, the recent run-up of headline and core prices represents “noise” rather than underlying “signal.” Given that the Fed focuses on signals about intermediate and long-term sustainable, noninflationary employment growth, rather than short-term expediency, it is in keeping with our charter to give considerable weight to this scenario.\n\nI note that we would not be alone in doing so. This is the conclusion that the Bank of England has been most public about as it recently ceased raising its policy rate. I have the highest personal regard for Governor Mervyn King and especially for his deputy, a member of the distinguished advisory board of the Dallas Fed’s Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute, the convivially named Mr. Charlie Bean. I did note, however, that in reaction to the recent release of the Bank of England’s analysis, the Financial Times on Thursday wrote an especially harsh editorial titled “Shoot the Doves,” which concluded with these words:\n\n“The ongoing disruption in credit markets is acting as a brake on the economy … because credit is less available and it costs more .… Keeping rates on hold looks right for now.”\n\n“But,” the editorial went on, “… the Bank must also worry about its credibility: if the public ceases to believe that it will bring inflation back down, then it will become much harder to do so.”[2]\n\nThis risk applies to the Fed just as much as it does to the Bank of England. We cannot afford to gamble away our credibility. That is why the FOMC has made it clear in its recent statements that we are keenly monitoring inflationary impulses. In doing so, we must be wary of a second possible scenario, one that differs from the one summarized by Dr. Feldstein.\n\nThis second scenario is less felicitous. It acknowledges the manic-depressive nature of commodity markets and recognizes that it was inevitable that price peaks would give way to price valleys. But the scenario envisions the possibility that rather than passing through the python, the recent burst of cost-push inflation is giving the beast digestion problems that might manifest themselves in the form of a lingering inflationary fever.\n\nMany micros make a macro. The economy is the sum of its parts. Jobs are created by, and prices are set by, microeconomic units, by businesses—thousands upon thousands upon thousands of them.\n\nBusiness operators do what they are paid to do—grow their bottom lines in good times and protect them in bad. Presently, it is difficult to grow top lines in the U.S. domestic market because demand is anemic. And yet it is increasingly difficult to protect bottom lines because critical components of the cost of goods sold have been rising. What comes in through the back door of most businesses has been rising, driven by fuel and transportation and other input costs. Labor costs at home have been restrained. But labor costs in other places where American companies produce and source goods, particularly China, have been rising dramatically.\n\nHere is where the globalization process hits the inflationary road. Not long ago, the newfound desire of the Chinese and Indians and former Soviet satellites and the Brazilians and others to hop onboard the capitalist ship led to a flood of cheap labor and low-cost goods and outsourced services. Our economy experienced the most pleasant of tailwinds, propelling it forward while restraining inflation. Now that these countries are climbing up the income ladder and consuming more of what we consume, we are facing a bracing headwind from the very same sources that previously helped our economy sail along.\n\nThe Chinese Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security reports that in the first half of this year, wages in urban areas, where most U.S. and foreign firms make or assemble products, rose 18 percent. And, as any U.S. firm operating in China will tell you, recent stepped-up enforcement of job rules has made China an even more expensive place to operate.\n\nI cannot tell you how much we should weigh this particular cost component. Nobody knows the answer to how this impacts cost structures here at home. But this much is clear: The tailwind that was holding labor costs at home hostage to the threat of outsourcing production to China has been significantly mitigated. Any garment producer or hospital equipment maker or high tech assembler operating in China can testify to that.\n\nIn addition, as income levels have risen in the emerging countries, so has their appetite for raw materials and basic necessities. China, for example, now has 37 million cars; the press reports that they will reach 50 million cars in 2009, on their way to some 100 million in fairly short order. Fueling that fleet contributes to the country’s rising demand for oil, now largely satisfied by imports of 8 million barrels of oil a day. As China grows, she will require still more oil. How much? Well, here is a simple calculation you can do. A week ago, the Wall Street Journal [3] pointed out that the Japanese consume 14 barrels of oil per capita each year, whereas the Europeans consume 17 and the Americans 25. If China used the same amount of oil per capita as parsimonious Japan, China’s consumption would total more than 18 billion barrels a year, an amount that dwarfs our consumption of 7.5 billion barrels. Add that to new demand stemming for oil from the billion people of India, the new members of the European community, an increasingly prosperous Brazil and so on, and extrapolate these new demand pressures for oil to wood or steel or food oils or animal proteins or anything else that growing economies consume, and you begin to get the picture of what keeps a forward-thinking businesswoman or man up at night.\n\nIf you layer a Chinese wage-price spiral and demand-pull forces on top of the shiver sent up the spine by sudden price increases in most raw materials this past year, you might forgive U.S. business operators—the women and men who do the spadework to create the employment we seek to encourage through prudent monetary policy—for doing what rational managers do to protect their margins. At bedtime, they may pray on their knees, thanking the market gods for the recent correction in prices for oil and gas and other materials. But during the day they are doing two things: (1) They are cutting whatever costs they have control over by reducing head count, stretching out inventories, pulling back on capital expenditures, and so on; and (2) they are seeking to pass through costs that are out of their direct control—the ones that are coming through the back door—by raising prices of the goods and services they ship out the front door.\n\nOn August 1, for example, the Wall Street Journal [4]reported that Unilever offset cost pressures by raising the average price of its thousands of products by 7.4 percent, despite having seen its volume of goods sold slip by 0.5 percent in the second quarter. The article added that Unilever’s CEO “didn’t plan to make any major changes.”\n\nNeither, according to public reports, do companies as varied as Dow Chemical, Frito-Lay, Kodak, McDonald’s, American Airlines and the various 99 cent stores. Even Bloomberg, the great electronic purveyor of financial information and news, is protecting margins by raising prices: Last week, they notified their customers, including the Dallas Fed, they would be increasing prices by 6 percent on December 1. It was noteworthy that in releasing his company’s earnings for the second quarter, the CFO of Wal-Mart said suppliers were asking for price increases at a “higher level than I can remember since I began at the company.”[5]\n\nThis behavioral response, were it to become even more widespread, leads to unpleasant consequences for me and my fellow policymakers. Unless the python that is the U.S. economy can quickly pass the recent burst of cost-push pressures, we risk a reinforcing spreading of inflationary impulses and expectations. Should this happen and the Fed were to fail to address it, we would run the risk of losing the public’s confidence in our ability to constrain inflation. Then the great editorial writers in this country, to say nothing of Congress and the American people, will be calling for all of us—doves and hawks alike—to be shot (metaphorically speaking, of course).\n\nThus, I urge you to observe closely the noble python. He might digest and dispatch the recent inflationary surge, or he might gag on it. It is too early to tell. And until we have a clear sense of what will prevail, monetary policy makers must remain poised to act if slowing growth fails to contain inflationary pressures.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "August 18, 2008 Aspen, Colorado\n\nI may have the longest record of experience with China of anybody in this room, including Chinese nationals. My Australian father and South African-born Norwegian mother sailed out of Shanghai on the S.S. President Wilson just as that port was being closed by Communist revolutionaries in 1948. In a story too long to tell, my parents had been dispatched to collect a dollar payment owed an American company—the Spazier Chemical and Soap Company. They left Shanghai with more than Spazier’s loot: My mother was with child—me. I was born the following March, the felicitous by-product of an otherwise fretful stay at the Peace Hotel on the Bund.\n\nI have been asked to speak to you tomorrow about “Monetary Policy in a Globalized World.” Tonight, I establish my bona fides for that talk: I was manufactured by an Australian–South African/Norwegian partnership in China, shipped across the Pacific and on to Mexico for final assembly, and then sent across the border to the U.S. to become one of the innumerable factors that make for a dynamic economy that is uniquely American. You can’t be more globalized than that!\n\nMy embryonic experience allows me to lay claim to being a China watcher for nearly 60 years. But it was only in 1979, when I served in the Carter administration as coordinator of policy planning and assistant to Treasury Secretary Michael Blumenthal, that I first saw China. I mention this for a reason. My early experience in China, coupled with my involvement 20 years later in negotiating China’s accession to the World Trade Organization for President Clinton, forms the lens through which I now view China.\n\nI am going to focus my brief remarks tonight on some of the perspectives gained from that first trip to China.\n\nPresident Nixon and Henry Kissinger had famously normalized political relations with China in their meetings with Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai in 1972. It fell on President Carter to settle the counterclaims between the U.S. and China that stemmed from the Communist takeover in 1949. Mao’s forces failed to seize the cash of Spazier Chemical and Soap, but managed to seize the railroad stock and other assets the U.S. had lent or invested in Nationalist China; we, in turn, retaliated by freezing China’s accounts in U.S. banks. Without settling those counterclaims, we could not normally trade with each other. So after months of rigorous preparation, Secretary Blumenthal and his team, including me as his faithful chef de cabinet, were dispatched from Andrews Air Force Base to Beijing on Feb. 23, 1979, to settle the claims. We met with Deng Xiaoping, then-Chairman Hua Guofeng [1]—a hapless fellow traveler of Mao’s whom we met with only for the purposes of being photographed for the People’s Daily but paid little attention to, given that we knew of Deng’s ascendancy—and Blumenthal’s official counterpart, Finance Minister Zhang Jin-fu. We sealed the preliminary deal on March 1, after arduous negotiations with Deng and Zhang, and that day officially raised the flag over the American Embassy in Beijing, establishing the fulsome presence of the U.S. in China.\n\nThe memories of this trip flooded back as I viewed the opening ceremonies of the spectacle and pageantry of the Olympics in Beijing.\n\nWhen we landed in that city on Saturday night, Feb. 24, 1979, we were whisked off to the official guesthouse in Red Flag limousines. The roads into Beijing had no cars—not because the route had been cordoned off for our delegation but because there simply weren’t any. What traffic we did see included skinny horses, donkeys, camels, oxen, exhaust-spewing trucks and countless bicycles made in the Forever bicycle factory in Shanghai for the purpose of realizing Zhou’s “four modernizations.”\n\nBy 2006, just 27 years later, Beijing had some 2.4 million motor vehicles, a small fraction of China’s total of 37 million.\n\nThink about that. Worldwide, roughly half of oil production goes into making gasoline and diesel fuel. In 2008, China is projected to consume nearly 8 million barrels of oil daily. Let’s say that, conservatively, 2.5 million barrels of that goes into propelling the present auto and truck fleet of the country. You can do the numbers and see the amount of oil that will be required just to feed the fleet of Chinese autos as it grows to 100 million.\n\nWhen the Blumenthal delegation arrived in Beijing in 1979, the main customers for OPEC and other oil producers were the U.S., Japan and Western Europe. You may remember that in today’s dollars the price of oil was broaching $90 at that time, on its way the next year to $100 plus. Now, oil producers have as customers an added 1.3 billion Chinese, who not only drive cars but operate factories and require heat for their homes, as well as the populations of catch-up players like India and the countries liberated from Soviet tyranny. This puts the supply and demand for oil and diesel and gasoline into perspective. A week ago, the Wall Street Journal pointed out that Japan consumes 14 barrels of oil a year per capita, Europe consumes 17 and America consumes 25. If China used the same amount per capita as parsimonious Japan, Chinese consumption would total more than 18 billion barrels a year, an amount that dwarfs our country’s 7.5 billion barrels. Add that to new demand for oil stemming from India, the newest members of the European community, an increasingly prosperous Brazil and so on. For those trying to discern the long-term future of oil prices, this is considerable food for thought.\n\nOnce we reached the initial agreement to settle our claims on China—at roughly 40 cents on the dollar—we flew to Shanghai on a Chinese military plane for a little R&R before returning to Beijing to tidy up some fine points. The Chinese government had picked out the prettiest military women they could muster to serve us drinks and meals on the flight—nothing becomes a pretty woman like the uniform of the People’s Liberation Army. On a whim, my counterpart and seat mate from the State Department, Bob Hormats, who is now vice chairman of Goldman Sachs, took out a Polaroid camera and took a picture of these impromptu flight attendants. You would have thought he had struck a match in some far corner of the world where fire had never been seen. The flight attendants squealed with delight, and the entire crew, including the pilots, came to the back of the plane to examine this previously unseen, newfangled technology. Imagine that. This was roughly a quarter century after Polaroid had become commonplace in the U.S. and four years after the two Steves—Jobs and Wozniak—brought forth the first commercial Apple computer. The Chinese public had never seen a Polaroid camera, let alone heard of a computer.\n\nPolaroid has since gone kaput. China now owns what used to be IBM’s PC business. Today, China produces 93.4 million microcomputers, and it has 600 million domestic cell phone subscribers. The country has become the world’s largest exporter of information technology goods. The Chinese conduct technological espionage so brilliantly that business and government leaders in Europe and the U.S. are told that any conversation held anywhere in the world within range of a BlackBerry can be listened to by Chinese agents even if you have it turned off, so long as the SIM card and battery are in place.\n\nWe no longer regard China as a technological backwater. Think back to that opening Olympic ceremony two Friday nights ago. In 1979, a Polaroid camera stunned the most advanced Chinese military pilots. In 2008, the show put on in the Olympic “Bird’s Nest” exhibited an ability to harness technology that rivals the most sophisticated weapons or game designer or software programmer in Silicon Valley.\n\nWhich brings me to this ancient land’s willingness to adopt and adapt. When Deng Xiaoping entered the room for the initial encounter with Blumenthal, he cackled, “Where are these big American capitalists we Chinese are supposed to be so afraid of?” During our meeting, he made a remark that paralleled his famous “black cat, white cat” theme—“it doesn’t matter if the cat is white or black as long as it catches mice.” Deng’s remarks encapsulated the importance of practical results over political correctness and economic development over ideological purity—both hallmarks of modern China. Deng made it clear to our delegation that China was intent on modernization, that the Chinese cat was focused on catching droves of economic mice as it engaged the rest of the world, starting with the trade that would be liberated from our settlement that week.\n\nThis China has done. In 1979, the U.S. imported a mere $595 million from China under onerous tariffs; the Chinese did not have a single dollar in official reserves. Now, they send more than $300 billion in goods to the U.S. and hold over $840 billion in U.S. Treasuries and agencies. Since Deng’s ascendancy, China has grown its economy at least 10 percent per annum, has become the world’s pivotal factory and is quickly moving to the cutting edge of technology.\n\nThe Chinese are survivors. During our trip to Beijing in 1979, we were treated to a soiree in the Great Hall of the People on Feb. 27. The seventh act of the evening was a piano recital—a performance of Liszt’s “Hungarian Fantasy No. 6”—by a haggard and emaciated pianist named Liu Shikun. Today, Liu is regarded as China’s finest pianist; he has performed worldwide, including with Seiji Ozawa and the Boston Symphony for one of the best-selling classical music albums of all time. He had given his premiere performance at the age of 5. In 1949, at the age of 10, he had won the Chinese National Competition for Teenagers and Children. In 1956, at the age of 17, he was so brilliant in his performances around the world that the Hungarian government presented him with a lock of Liszt’s hair. He was a boy wonder, a musical genius who won innumerable international competitions worldwide.\n\nIf you read Liu’s official Chinese biography, you will note that “he has performed in front of several generations of Chinese statesmen, including Mao Zedong … Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao.” What it does not tell you is that he was imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution and maintained his skills by carving a keyboard on the wall of his cell and playing it day after day, hearing its music only in his imagination. His performance for us was one of his first public appearances since his “rehabilitation,” and it was so stirring that even our Chinese hosts, many of whom had blood on their hands, were moved to tears.\n\nI thought of Liu when I saw those eight People’s Liberation Army soldiers goose-step their way forward with the Olympic flag. They, too, are symbolic of modern China, a nation whose thousands of years of history have given us numerous repressive leaders.\n\nChina occasions an update of Winston Churchill’s famous epigram about Russia: “It is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.” With China, things are not always what they seem. The Olympics have provided us with at least two examples of that. The fireworks in the video of the opening ceremonies contained computer-generated images to make the display more vivid. A cute-as-a-button 9-year-old girl lip-synched the national anthem being sung by a 7-year-old reportedly deemed not attractive enough by a member of the Politburo.\n\nThese enigmatic efforts to control and to bend reality to conform to image were evident during my 1979 visit to China. The front page of the March 1 edition of the People’s Daily prominently displayed a photograph of Chairman Hua escorting Secretary Blumenthal, Treasury Undersecretary Anthony Solomon and Assistant Secretary of State Jules Katz, with me in tow, into the Great Hall. A discerning viewer would have detected that the shape of our eyes had been doctored by hand into almond-shaped, Chinese-like features.\n\nThe economic advances that put millions of Chinese in cars are real, as is the technological prowess on display in global markets and at the Olympics. The determination of a pianist practicing on a makeshift keyboard is real, as is the discipline of the goose-stepping soldiers of the PLA. But here is the message: As we contemplate modern China’s impact on our economy and culture and national security, we must work to find the China that lies behind a carefully crafted façade. Churchill concluded his alliterative “riddle, mystery and enigma” line by saying that the key to getting our minds around a perplexing Russia was an understanding of her underlying national interests. In contemplating China, we need to look past carefully crafted images and deepen our understanding of her national interest. Failure to do so will be perilous.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "May 28, 2008 San Francisco, California\n\nThank you, Bruce [Ericson]. I am honored to be here this evening and am grateful for the invitation to speak to the Commonwealth Club of California.\n\nAlan Greenspan and Paul Volcker, two of Ben Bernanke’s linear ancestors as chairmen of the Federal Reserve, have been in the news quite a bit lately. Yet, we rarely hear about William McChesney Martin, a magnificent public servant who was Fed chairman during five presidencies and to this day holds the record for the longest tenure: 19 years.\n\nChairman Martin had a way with words. And he had a twinkle in his eye. It was Bill Martin who wisely and succinctly defined the Federal Reserve as having the unenviable task “to take away the punchbowl just as the party gets going.” He did himself one up when he received the Alfalfa Club’s nomination for the presidency of the United States. I suspect many here tonight have been to the annual Alfalfa dinner. It is one of the great institutions in Washington, D.C. Once a year, it holds a dinner devoted solely to poking fun at the political pretensions of the day. Tongue firmly in cheek, the club nominates a candidate to run for the presidency on the Alfalfa Party ticket. Of course, none of them ever win. Nominees are thenceforth known for evermore as members of the Stassen Society, named for Harold Stassen, who ran for president nine times and lost every time, then ran a tenth time on the Alfalfa ticket and lost again. The motto of the group is Veni, Vidi, Defici—“I came, I saw, I lost.”\n\nBill Martin was nominated to run and lose on the Alfalfa Party ticket in 1966, while serving as Fed chairman during Lyndon Johnson’s term. In his acceptance speech,[1] he announced that, given his proclivities as a central banker, he would take his cues from the German philosopher Goethe, “who said that people could endure anything except continual prosperity.” Therefore, Martin declared, he would adopt a platform proclaiming that as a president he planned to “make life endurable again by stamping out prosperity.”\n\n“I shall conduct the administration of the country,” he said, “exactly as I have so successfully conducted the affairs of the Federal Reserve. To that end, I shall assemble the best brains that can be found…ask their advice on all matters…and completely confound them by following all their conflicting counsel.”\n\nIt is true, Bruce, that as you said in your introduction, I am one of the 17 people who participate in Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) deliberations and provide Ben Bernanke with “conflicting counsel” as the committee cobbles together a monetary policy that seeks to promote America’s economic prosperity, Goethe to the contrary. But tonight I speak for neither the committee, nor the chairman, nor any of the other good people that serve the Federal Reserve System. I speak solely in my own capacity. I want to speak to you tonight about an economic problem that we must soon confront or else risk losing our primacy as the world’s most powerful and dynamic economy.\n\nForty-three years ago this Sunday, Bill Martin delivered a commencement address to Columbia University that was far more sober than his Alfalfa Club speech. The opening lines of that Columbia address [2] were as follows: “When economic prospects are at their brightest, the dangers of complacency and recklessness are greatest. As our prosperity proceeds on its record-breaking path, it behooves every one of us to scan the horizon of our national and international economy for danger signals so as to be ready for any storm.”\n\nToday, our fellow citizens and financial markets are paying the price for falling victim to the complacency and recklessness Martin warned against. Few scanned the horizon for trouble brewing as we proceeded along a path of unparalleled prosperity fueled by an unsustainable housing bubble and unbridled credit markets. Armchair or Monday morning quarterbacks will long debate whether the Fed could have/should have/would have taken away the punchbowl that lubricated that blowout party. I have given my opinion on that matter elsewhere and won’t go near that subject tonight. What counts now is what we have done more recently and where we go from here. Whatever the sins of omission or commission committed by our predecessors, the Bernanke FOMC’s objective is to use a new set of tools to calm the tempest in the credit markets to get them back to functioning in a more orderly fashion. We trust that the various term credit facilities we have recently introduced are helping restore confidence while the credit markets undertake self-corrective initiatives and lawmakers consider new regulatory schemes.\n\nI am also not going to engage in a discussion of present monetary policy tonight, except to say that if inflationary developments and, more important, inflation expectations, continue to worsen, I would expect a change of course in monetary policy to occur sooner rather than later, even in the face of an anemic economic scenario. Inflation is the most insidious enemy of capitalism. No central banker can countenance it, not least the men and women of the Federal Reserve.\n\nTonight, I want to talk about a different matter. In keeping with Bill Martin’s advice, I have been scanning the horizon for danger signals even as we continue working to recover from the recent turmoil. In the distance, I see a frightful storm brewing in the form of untethered government debt. I choose the words—“frightful storm”—deliberately to avoid hyperbole. Unless we take steps to deal with it, the long-term fiscal situation of the federal government will be unimaginably more devastating to our economic prosperity than the subprime debacle and the recent debauching of credit markets that we are now working so hard to correct.\n\nYou might wonder why a central banker would be concerned with fiscal matters. Fiscal policy is, after all, the responsibility of the Congress, not the Federal Reserve. Congress, and Congress alone, has the power to tax and spend. From this monetary policymaker’s point of view, though, deficits matter for what we do at the Fed. There are many reasons why. Economists have found that structural deficits raise long-run interest rates, complicating the Fed’s dual mandate to develop a monetary policy that promotes sustainable, noninflationary growth. The even more disturbing dark and dirty secret about deficits—especially when they careen out of control—is that they create political pressure on central bankers to adopt looser monetary policy down the road. I will return to that shortly. First, let me give you the unvarnished facts of our nation’s fiscal predicament.\n\nEight years ago, our federal budget, crafted by a Democratic president and enacted by a Republican Congress, produced a fiscal surplus of $236 billion, the first surplus in almost 40 years and the highest nominal-dollar surplus in American history. While the Fed is scrupulously nonpartisan and nonpolitical, I mention this to emphasize that the deficit/debt issue knows no party and can be solved only by both parties working together. For a brief time, with surpluses projected into the future as far as the eye could see, economists and policymakers alike began to contemplate a bucolic future in which interest payments would form an ever-declining share of federal outlays, a future where Treasury bonds and debt-ceiling legislation would become dusty relics of a long-forgotten past. The Fed even had concerns about how open market operations would be conducted in a marketplace short of Treasury debt.\n\nThat utopian scenario did not last for long. Over the next seven years, federal spending grew at a 6.2 percent nominal annual rate while receipts grew at only 3.5 percent. Of course, certain areas of government, like national defense, had to spend more in the wake of 9/11. But nondefense discretionary spending actually rose 6.4 percent annually during this timeframe, outpacing the growth in total expenditures. Deficits soon returned, reaching an expected $410 billion for 2008—a $600 billion swing from where we were just eight years ago. This $410 billion estimate, by the way, was made before the recently passed farm bill and supplemental defense appropriation and without considering a proposed patch for the Alternative Minimum Tax—all measures that will lead to a further ballooning of government deficits.\n\nIn keeping with the tradition of rosy scenarios, official budget projections suggest this deficit will be relatively short-lived. They almost always do. According to the official calculus, following a second $400-billion-plus deficit in 2009, the red ink should fall to $160 billion in 2010 and $95 billion in 2011, and then the budget swings to a $48 billion surplus in 2012.\n\nIf you do the math, however, you might be forgiven for sensing that these felicitous projections look a tad dodgy. To reach the projected 2012 surplus, outlays are assumed to rise at a 2.4 percent nominal annual rate over the next four years—less than half as fast as they rose the previous seven years. Revenue is assumed to rise at a 6.7 percent nominal annual rate over the next four years—almost double the rate of the past seven years. Using spending and revenue growth rates that have actually prevailed in recent years, the 2012 surplus quickly evaporates and becomes a deficit, potentially of several hundred billion dollars.\n\nDoing deficit math is always a sobering exercise. It becomes an outright painful one when you apply your calculator to the long-run fiscal challenge posed by entitlement programs. Were I not a taciturn central banker, I would say the mathematics of the long-term outlook for entitlements, left unchanged, is nothing short of catastrophic.\n\nTypically, critics ranging from the Concord Coalition to Ross Perot begin by wringing their collective hands over the unfunded liabilities of Social Security. A little history gives you a view as to why. Franklin Roosevelt originally conceived a social security system in which individuals would fund their own retirements through payroll-tax contributions. But Congress quickly realized that such a system could not put much money into the pockets of indigent elderly citizens ravaged by the Great Depression. Instead, a pay-as-you-go funding system was embraced, making each generation’s retirement the responsibility of its children.\n\nNow, fast forward 70 or so years and ask this question: What is the mathematical predicament of Social Security today? Answer: The amount of money the Social Security system would need today to cover all unfunded liabilities from now on—what fiscal economists call the “infinite horizon discounted value” of what has already been promised recipients but has no funding mechanism currently in place—is $13.6 trillion, an amount slightly less than the annual gross domestic product of the United States.\n\nDemographics explain why this is so. Birthrates have fallen dramatically, reducing the worker–retiree ratio and leaving today’s workers pulling a bigger load than the system designers ever envisioned. Life spans have lengthened without a corresponding increase in the retirement age, leaving retirees in a position to receive benefits far longer than the system designers envisioned. Formulae for benefits and cost-of-living adjustments have also contributed to the growth in unfunded liabilities.\n\nThe good news is this Social Security shortfall might be manageable. While the issues regarding Social Security reform are complex, it is at least possible to imagine how Congress might find, within a $14 trillion economy, ways to wrestle with a $13 trillion unfunded liability. The bad news is that Social Security is the lesser of our entitlement worries. It is but the tip of the unfunded liability iceberg. The much bigger concern is Medicare, a program established in 1965, the same prosperous year that Bill Martin cautioned his Columbia University audience to be wary of complacency and storms on the horizon.\n\nMedicare was a pay-as-you-go program from the very beginning, despite warnings from some congressional leaders—Wilbur Mills was the most credible of them before he succumbed to the pay-as-you-go wiles of Fanne Foxe, the Argentine Firecracker—who foresaw some of the long-term fiscal issues such a financing system could pose. Unfortunately, they were right.\n\nPlease sit tight while I walk you through the math of Medicare. As you may know, the program comes in three parts: Medicare Part A, which covers hospital stays; Medicare B, which covers doctor visits; and Medicare D, the drug benefit that went into effect just 29 months ago. The infinite-horizon present discounted value of the unfunded liability for Medicare A is $34.4 trillion. The unfunded liability of Medicare B is an additional $34 trillion. The shortfall for Medicare D adds another $17.2 trillion. The total? If you wanted to cover the unfunded liability of all three programs today, you would be stuck with an $85.6 trillion bill. That is more than six times as large as the bill for Social Security. It is more than six times the annual output of the entire U.S. economy.\n\nWhy is the Medicare figure so large? There is a mix of reasons, really. In part, it is due to the same birthrate and life-expectancy issues that affect Social Security. In part, it is due to ever-costlier advances in medical technology and the willingness of Medicare to pay for them. And in part, it is due to expanded benefits—the new drug benefit program’s unfunded liability is by itself one-third greater than all of Social Security’s.\n\nAdd together the unfunded liabilities from Medicare and Social Security, and it comes to $99.2 trillion over the infinite horizon. Traditional Medicare composes about 69 percent, the new drug benefit roughly 17 percent and Social Security the remaining 14 percent.\n\nI want to remind you that I am only talking about the unfunded portions of Social Security and Medicare. It is what the current payment scheme of Social Security payroll taxes, Medicare payroll taxes, membership fees for Medicare B, copays, deductibles and all other revenue currently channeled to our entitlement system will not cover under current rules. These existing revenue streams must remain in place in perpetuity to handle the “funded” entitlement liabilities. Reduce or eliminate this income and the unfunded liability grows. Increase benefits and the liability grows as well.\n\nLet’s say you and I and Bruce Ericson and every U.S. citizen who is alive today decided to fully address this unfunded liability through lump-sum payments from our own pocketbooks, so that all of us and all future generations could be secure in the knowledge that we and they would receive promised benefits in perpetuity. How much would we have to pay if we split the tab? Again, the math is painful. With a total population of 304 million, from infants to the elderly, the per-person payment to the federal treasury would come to $330,000. This comes to $1.3 million per family of four—over 25 times the average household’s income.\n\nClearly, once-and-for-all contributions would be an unbearable burden. Alternatively, we could address the entitlement shortfall through policy changes that would affect ourselves and future generations. For example, a permanent 68 percent increase in federal income tax revenue—from individual and corporate taxpayers—would suffice to fully fund our entitlement programs. Or we could instead divert 68 percent of current income-tax revenues from their intended uses to the entitlement system, which would accomplish the same thing.\n\nSuppose we decided to tackle the issue solely on the spending side. It turns out that total discretionary spending in the federal budget, if maintained at its current share of GDP in perpetuity, is 3 percent larger than the entitlement shortfall. So all we would have to do to fully fund our nation’s entitlement programs would be to cut discretionary spending by 97 percent. But hold on. That discretionary spending includes defense and national security, education, the environment and many other areas, not just those controversial earmarks that make the evening news. All of them would have to be cut—almost eliminated, really—to tackle this problem through discretionary spending.\n\nI hope that gives you some idea of just how large the problem is. And just to drive an important point home, these spending cuts or tax increases would need to be made immediately and maintained in perpetuity to solve the entitlement deficit problem. Discretionary spending would have to be reduced by 97 percent not only for our generation, but for our children and their children and every generation of children to come. And similarly on the taxation side, income tax revenue would have to rise 68 percent and remain that high forever. Remember, though, I said tax revenue, not tax rates. Who knows how much individual and corporate tax rates would have to change to increase revenue by 68 percent?\n \nIf these possible solutions to the unfunded-liability problem seem draconian, it’s because they are draconian. But they do serve to give you a sense of the severity of the problem. To be sure, there are ways to lessen the reliance on any single policy and the burden borne by any particular set of citizens. Most proposals to address long-term entitlement debt, for example, rely on a combination of tax increases, benefit reductions and eligibility changes to find the trillions necessary to safeguard the system over the long term.\n\nNo combination of tax hikes and spending cuts, though, will change the total burden borne by current and future generations. For the existing unfunded liabilities to be covered in the end, someone must pay $99.2 trillion more or receive $99.2 trillion less than they have been currently promised. This is a cold, hard fact. The decision we must make is whether to shoulder a substantial portion of that burden today or compel future generations to bear its full weight.\n\nNow that you are all thoroughly depressed, let me come back to monetary policy and the Fed.\n\nIt is only natural to cast about for a solution—any solution—to avoid the fiscal pain we know is necessary because we succumbed to complacency and put off dealing with this looming fiscal disaster. Throughout history, many nations, when confronted by sizable debts they were unable or unwilling to repay, have seized upon an apparently painless solution to this dilemma: monetization. Just have the monetary authority run cash off the printing presses until the debt is repaid, the story goes, then promise to be responsible from that point on and hope your sins will be forgiven by God and Milton Friedman and everyone else.\n\nWe know from centuries of evidence in countless economies, from ancient Rome to today’s Zimbabwe, that running the printing press to pay off today’s bills leads to much worse problems later on. The inflation that results from the flood of money into the economy turns out to be far worse than the fiscal pain those countries hoped to avoid.\n \nEarlier I mentioned the Fed’s dual mandate to manage growth and inflation. In the long run, growth cannot be sustained if markets are undermined by inflation. Stable prices go hand in hand with achieving sustainable economic growth. I have said many, many times that inflation is a sinister beast that, if uncaged, devours savings, erodes consumers’ purchasing power, decimates returns on capital, undermines the reliability of financial accounting, distracts the attention of corporate management, undercuts employment growth and real wages, and debases the currency.\n\nPurging rampant inflation and a debased currency requires administering a harsh medicine. We have been there, and we know the cure that was wrought by the FOMC under Paul Volcker. Even the perception that the Fed is pursuing a cheap-money strategy to accommodate fiscal burdens, should it take root, is a paramount risk to the long-term welfare of the U.S. economy. The Federal Reserve will never let this happen. It is not an option. Ever. Period.\n\nThe way we resolve these liabilities—and resolve them we must—will affect our own well-being as well as the prospects of future generations and the global economy. Failing to face up to our responsibility will produce the mother of all financial storms. The warning signals have been flashing for years, but we find it easier to ignore them than to take action. Will we take the painful fiscal steps necessary to prevent the storm by reducing and eventually eliminating our fiscal imbalances? That depends on you.\n\nI mean “you” literally. This situation is of your own creation. When you berate your representatives or senators or presidents for the mess we are in, you are really berating yourself. You elect them. You are the ones who let them get away with burdening your children and grandchildren rather than yourselves with the bill for your entitlement programs.\n\nThis issue transcends political affiliation. When George Shultz, one of San Francisco’s greatest Republican public servants, was director of President Nixon’s Office of Management and Budget, he became worried about the amount of money Congress was proposing to spend. After some nights of tossing and turning, he called legendary staffer Sam Cohen into his office. Cohen had a long memory of budget matters and knew every zig and zag of budget history. “Sam,” Shultz asked, “tell me something just between you and me. Is there any difference between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to spending money?” Cohen looked at him, furrowed his brow and, after thinking about it, replied, “Mr. Shultz, there is only one difference: Democrats enjoy it more.”\n\nYet no one, Democrat or Republican, enjoys placing our children and grandchildren and their children and grandchildren in harm’s way. No one wants to see the frightful storm of unfunded long-term liabilities destroy our economy or threaten the independence and authority of our central bank or tear our currency asunder.\n\nOf late, we have heard many complaints about the weakness of the dollar against the euro and other currencies. It was recently argued in the op-ed pages of the Financial Times [3] that one reason for the demise of the British pound was the need to liquidate England’s international reserves to pay off the costs of the Great Wars. In the end, the pound, it was essentially argued, was sunk by the kaiser’s army and Hitler’s bombs. Right now, we—you and I—are launching fiscal bombs against ourselves. You have it in your power as the electors of our fiscal authorities to prevent this destruction. Please do so.",

            "content": "May 17, 2008 St. Petersburg, Florida\n\nThank you, Chairman [George] Michel. It is an honor to address the Class of ’08 here in this beautiful Garden Theatre. Right off the bat, Capt. [Robert J.] Fine, I want to congratulate you and your staff and the students for the honor you continue to bring to David Glasgow Farragut’s good name. I understand that six of this afternoon’s graduates received service academy appointments, another 12 received Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) scholarships and 100 percent of the class is college bound. That is heady stuff. The hero of the Battle of Mobile Bay would be proud.\n\nI want the Class of 2008 to stand up. Now turn around. Look at all these people who have come to celebrate your success. These are your parents, your brothers and sisters, your other relatives and your friends and teachers. They have been at your side through joyful moments and less joyful ones. They have for some 18 years encouraged you and pushed you. They have believed in you. And now they are here to celebrate with you your admission to the society of educated men and women.\n\nJust as your admirers will soon applaud you, I want you to take this opportunity to applaud them. Thank them for their love and support.\n\nMr. Chairman, your introduction brought back some precious memories and reminded me of the long distance I have traversed since the summer of 1963, when I showed up on the banks of Toms River on the North Campus in New Jersey, a skinny little 14-year-old, both afraid and excited about the adventure that lay ahead. I was lucky to be taught by people you mentioned, dedicated educators like Vernie Romefeld and Stan Darby, God rest their souls, and others I hold dear to this day 40-odd years later. I was lucky to be coached by Stan Slaby, who badgered and coerced me to excel on the playing fields, toughening me up for the challenges of life in a sometimes relentlessly competitive world.\n\nBest of all, I was lucky to have made lifelong friends there. I am delighted to see Ed DeSeta here today. He was our battalion commander, just as his son Alex would be 35 years later—the first father–son battalion commander legacy in the academy’s history. For an entire academic year, I stood right behind Ed three times a day in parade formation as his “exec” as we drew swords, took reports and marched into meals. To this day, I remember the back of his head! I am glad to see it remains as noble now as it was then.\n\nThree other classmates are here today as well. My roommate Alex Garcias, who came from Cuba and zipped through Farragut’s academics like gee whiz, graduated as class vice president and as commander of the First Company and went on to Vanderbilt University and a prestigious career as a urologist. Russ Phillips, who hailed from the small town of Finksburg, Md., and used his prodigious brain to win the Headmaster’s and English awards our junior year and his ample muscle to play fullback on the football team, became First Company lieutenant junior grade, then went on to Duke and a stellar career in financial services. Robert Jauernig, a Californian who became Second Company commander, had a mind that was so quick and dynamic that we nicknamed him “IBM.” After Farragut, he darted off to Rensselaer Polytechnic on an ROTC scholarship and then on to direct the U.S. Navy’s electronic and logistical warfare needs in the first Gulf War before becoming a big deal in the New York banking community.\n\nLast night, Alex and Russ and Bob and I did what middle-aged men do when they gather to reminisce: We ate good food, drank a little wine, told lies about the women who swore they loved us, and recalled old friends from Admiral Farragut Academy. Most important of all, we discussed what I might say to you today.\n\nThe standard reflex of a commencement speaker is to troll through Bartlett’s or the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations or Wikipedia to find something wise that puts the nobility of education in a glorious light. You might remember the definition of a good essay as a collection of other people’s thoughts disguised to look like your own. Commencement speeches are no different.\n\nHoping to find something profound I might pinch and adapt to inspire you today, I wandered through abridged versions of the great minds of the ages: Socrates, Cicero, Mencius, St. Augustine, Voltaire, Muhammed, Martin Luther … Mae West, Jessica Simpson, Miley Cyrus. Alas, I found nothing that I could be certain you had not heard many times before. So I turned to my three classmates.\n\nThey reminded me that at Farragut in the 1960s, no doubt much like it was for Chairman Michel in the Class of ’49, we had drilled into us those maxims that define leadership. Our favorites came from the lips of heroes past:\n\nJohn Paul Jones, the “Father of the Navy,” described a leader as “a gentleman of liberal education, refined manners, punctilious courtesy, and the nicest sense of personal honor.”\n\nThe immortal Winston Churchill said: “Never give in, never, never, never, never—in nothing, great or small, large or petty—never give in except to convictions of honour and good sense. Never yield to force; never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy.”\n\nRobert E. Lee said, “Never do a wrong thing to make a friend or keep one.”\n\nAnd Gen. George Patton wisely advised that a leader should “Never”—these Great Men sure like to use the word “never”—“tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do and they will surprise you with their ingenuity.”\n\nAfter a wee bit too much cabernet, Russ Phillips came up with this, which is thought to be from Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf: “Going to war without France is like going deer hunting without your accordion.” (I’ll have to use my leadership skills and tell Russ to surprise everyone with his ingenuity by sticking to his current successful career and not turn to speechwriting).\n\nEvery commencement speaker at every school and university, including Gen. Schwarzkopf, will dispense pretty much the same advice over the next few weeks of commencements: Be disciplined; be prepared; be loyal, brave and thrifty; don’t waste your talents; take risks; push the envelope; respect your fellow men and women; serve others; never compromise your integrity; to thine own self be true and be true to community and country; give back when others have given to you; promise no more than you can deliver; stick to your obligations; never—there it is again—never forget you have talent to do good; never, never, never, never give up the pursuit of excellence.\n\nGreat words of wisdom can inspire us. And yet they do not determine who we are or what we might become. Character comes from our upbringing and our experiences—and it is on this very personal level that I want to address the seniors who will soon walk out of Admiral Farragut Academy with diploma in hand.\n\nI have been in your shoes. At 14, I was shipped off to Farragut North. It was, frankly, a tough and unforgiving place. Trust me: It had nothing as pretty as this Garden Theatre in this sunny enclave of St. Petersburg. When the wind howled off of Toms River in wintertime, it felt colder than the dark side of Pluto. Capt. Fine’s counterpart, our headmaster, was named Raven O. Dodge. He was a stern man. He had one arm. We lived in fear of him. But we respected him, even if the boyish wits on the swim team called him “Sidestroke” behind his back.\n\nWe rose at 6:15 every morning, mustered out to the parade field for inspection and marched to breakfast in formation. We had morning classes and then formed up and marched to lunch with our drum and bugle corps. After lunch came more classes, then activities and sports at 3:30. And then, for the last time of the day, we formed up and marched to dinner at 6. We went straight to our rooms after dinner to do homework before lights-out at 10. On weekends, we had full-dress parades. We learned how to handle weapons and, being at a naval academy prep school, how to tie knots and navigate by the stars.\n\nIn those days, Farragut was an all-male school. My buddies back home thought I was nuts. They were with their families, dating good-looking girls, driving cars, spending money, having fun, sleeping late and doing things in their own sweet time. I was in New Jersey for four years, marching to meals, studying hard, leading a highly disciplined life and getting by on a $2-a-week allowance. We got $5 a week as seniors, but it didn’t make a whole lot of difference because we only got out on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. My life and my friends’ lives were as different as night and day. Sound familiar?\n\nAnd yet, I wouldn’t go back and change any of it—even with the hindsight gained in the 45 years since I showed up on the doorstep of Farragut Hall. I wouldn’t change any of it because the lessons I learned in those four years made it possible for me to accomplish all those things that George Michel bragged on earlier. We learned to internalize—to come by as instinct—all those attributes mentioned so eloquently in those great leaders’ words I cited earlier. We learned the values of punctilious courtesy, sticking to conviction, never wronging a friend or bowing to overwhelming odds. We learned that semper fidelis—being always faithful to your country, your mission and your own potential—is reward in and of itself.\n\nWe also learned a lesson that is quintessentially unique to naval academy prep schools. When you wear a uniform and you live in the same dorms and eat the same food in the same place, nobody cares whether you are rich or poor or where you or your parents come from. I was the son of immigrants. My father never got past fourth grade; my mother was a secretary. Alex Garcias was a Cuban immigrant whose mother survived by waiting tables when she first landed on our shores. Bob Jauernig was an Army brat. Russ Phillips was a country boy from Finksburg. We were at school with a lot of rich boys from Manhattan and other tony places who had fancier bloodlines, but it didn’t make a bit of difference. You moved up in rank according to your effort and achievement. You got what you earned and you earned what you got.\n\nI can’t tell you how many times people now ask me: Just how did you get to Annapolis and to Harvard and all those fancy schools? How did you end up on Wall Street, make money, become an ambassador and do all those high-sounding things in Washington? How did you end up working with Henry Kissinger? And how did you end up sitting at the table with Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke at the Federal Reserve? What’s your secret?\n\nAn honest answer requires the ultimate disclaimer that it helps to have good luck on your side—serendipity comes in mighty handy. I have had way more than my share of it. But I believe that the lessons and disciplines learned at Farragut, just like those you have learned, are what allowed me to make the most of that good luck.\n\nAs to the secret, you can forget all those quotes from musty, dusty men of the past. I’m going to give it straight to you from the ultimate source: Oprah Winfrey. As accomplished an American as you will ever find, she says it best: “The big secret in life is that there is no big secret. Whatever your goal, you can get there if you’re willing to work.”\n\nThat hits the nail on the head. You need to dream of big things. But dreaming will not suffice. To succeed, you must work. If you are willing to work hard, you will achieve your goals. That is all you need to remember of this graduation speech. That, and the sound advice that you should never, never, never, never … go deer hunting with an accordion.",

            "content": "April 17, 2008 Chicago\n\nThank you, Charlie [Evans, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago]. And thank you, Mike Moskow for inviting me to speak to the Chicago Council. We miss you, Mike. For 13 years you brought not only wisdom but élan to that big mahogany table at the Fed, and none of us can quite fill that gap. The measure of a successful leader, however, is who he picks as his replacement, and with Charlie, you hit a home run.\n\nI especially appreciate Charlie’s mentioning my modest book collection. Part of that collection consists of documents and writings of British prime ministers. One of my favorites is Gladstone. He used to say that “only love has made more fools of men than contemplating the nature of money.” Yet, that is precisely what Charlie Evans and I and Ben Bernanke and our colleagues at the Federal Reserve do: We spend practically every waking hour contemplating the nature of money and the proper shape and conduct of our monetary system. So if you detect an air of distraction in Charlie Evans now and then, be kind. He has not gone mad or foolish on us; he is just hard at work noodling through our predicament and conjuring up Chicago’s recommendations on what we at the Federal Open Market Committee should do.\n\nLast week in San Antonio, I provided my perspective on the situation we now encounter in a marketplace entering the early stages of recovery from a period of excess, indiscriminate behavior and historical (and occasionally hysterical) amnesia, and on the efforts we at the Federal Reserve are making to calmly and prudently restore the efficacy of the financial markets. I said then—and I assert again today—that there is nothing “unprecedented” about the situation we find ourselves in. To illustrate the point, I want to read a passage from Washington Irving’s 1819 essay on the Mississippi Bubble.[1] For those of you who think the recent housing bubble and the ensuing financial imbroglio are “unprecedented,” listen to these words penned almost 200 years ago:\n\nAnd to think, Washington Irving had never met a subprime mortgage, or a CDO, a CLO, an SIV or a credit default swap! It is indeed true that those who ignore history are condemned to repeat it. That is the bad news. Financiers, “dazzle[ing] the credulous,” including regulators, repeated history in spades, despite their claim to unprecedentedly clever and new risk-management tools and mathematical sophistication. It was as short as it was momentarily “brilliant.” But that is done, and now we must do what we can to remedy the situation. One thing, however, is clear. The answer, to be curt, is not to compound the bad by repeating the oft-prescribed remedy of inflating our way out of our predicament with a wing-and-a-prayer promise that it can always be reined in later. It is for this reason that I have maintained a strong reluctance to further general monetary accommodation. At the same time, I have been an advocate of using our various discount window facilities, within reason, to bridge the financial system’s structural problems as the credit markets correct themselves and run the long course of contrition.\n\nEnough of that pleasantry. That is not what I came to speak about today. I don’t know about you, but I am weary of the woeful stuff that is constantly blaring from our newspapers and television sets and the Net, compounded as it is in the throes of a presidential election. Today, I would like to talk about something more uplifting—about the good news documented in another of my favorite books, the Dallas Fed’s annual report, which we have placed on each of your chairs and will be releasing to the public after this luncheon.\n\nI hail from one of those growing, prosperous Sunbelt cities that has burst forth as a center of U.S. economic growth in the past generation or two. Dallas is now the hub of the nation’s sixth largest metropolitan area, which joins the fifth largest metropolitan area in Houston and the ninth largest in the San Antonio–Austin region to form the economic backbone of a thriving state powered by the gumption of 24 million hard-working, hardscrabble souls. To be sure, our economy is lubricated by a robust energy industry. But it percolates on technology and information. I believe that my hometown of Dallas can serve as a microcosm for our nation’s tectonic shift from producing goods to producing services.\n\nBy Chicago standards, we Texans may be nouveau riche. But as my father used to say, “It is better to be nouveaux riche than not riche at all.” Lest you forget, back at the end of the 19th century, when Dallas and Houston and San Antonio and Austin were just a twinkle in our ancestors’ eyes, Chicago was considered equally nouveaux and brash by the folks in New York. It was that brashness that transformed Chicago from what Carl Sandburg described as “hog butcher for the world, tool maker, stacker of wheat, player with railroads and the nation’s freight handler” into one of the great cities and a cutting-edge center of finance- and information-based progress. You have repeatedly used your riches to evolve your economy, setting an example not just for Dallas but for all of America.\n\nWith each passing year, the U.S. economy relies less on the production of agricultural and factory goods and more on services to fulfill the American Dream. Today, four-fifths of our jobs are in services, a sprawling and diverse sector that includes janitors and cashiers and fast-food cooks, as well as bank presidents and college professors, software “geeks,” architects and filmmakers, chemical engineers and bioengineers, doctors and their nemeses, lawyers. Imagine this: In 2005, there were more or less the same number of people employed in the legal services profession as there were in the auto manufacturing sector, yet lawyers contributed twice as much of the value added to our GDP as the automobile manufacturers. We are a service-sector-driven economy, plain and simple.\n\nIn 1950, the height of America’s Industrial Age, Chicago had 42 percent of its workforce in manufacturing, mining and construction, a share significantly above the rest of the country. Today, industry as we knew it then accounts for just 17 percent of the Windy City’s job base, a number below the national average. The remaining 83 percent are in services, putting the city slightly above the national average.\n\nWith this remarkable shift from industry to services, Chicago’s economy has continued to grow, on net adding nearly 400,000 jobs in the past quarter century. A great many of them are high-paying service-sector positions, putting Chicago 11th among the nation’s 280 metropolitan areas in household income. That’s in the top 4 percent.\n\nThe more adaptable cities are—the more able and willing to remake their economies as times change—the better they do. In his 1916 poem, Sandburg portrayed the raw energy of an emerging industrial giant that was constantly building, breaking up and rebuilding. The economic way of life that defined that era of furious industrial activity may be ebbing or even lost to new industrial sites in China or Eastern Europe, but the fierce desire to keep moving forward has survived and, with it, Chicago’s claim to being a vibrant, top-ranking world city.\n\nOld Chicago, perhaps better than young Dallas or the other new cities of the Sunbelt, provides a perfect template for success in today’s era of globalization. The United States, like Chicago, can continue to prosper only if it faces economic change head-on, choosing to compete rather than retreat, seeking out new opportunities in a globalizing economy, where goods, services, money and ideas flow freely across international borders.\n\nOne of these opportunities—maybe the best one—lies in exporting services. The Dallas Fed explores this subject in its keynote essay in this year’s annual report, titled “Opportunity Knocks: Selling Our Services to the World.”[2] I urge each of you to read it. Apart from making you feel a bit better about this country’s economic future in a globalized and highly competitive world, it might give you some insight into which service industries are likely to outperform others as global demand expands, and why.\n\nLet me take you inside our report, starting with a look into the typical buying patterns of consumers—be they Americans, Chinese or South Africans. Data from nearly all parts of the world show us that consumers tend to spend relatively less on goods and more on services as their incomes rise. You might think of a shopping list. At the top of it are life’s necessities, led by the traditional triumvirate of food, clothing and shelter, followed by all sorts of household items, from knives and forks to furniture and appliances, and so on. These are largely goods. Once people have met their basic needs, they tend to want medical care, transportation and communication, information, recreation, entertainment, financial and legal advice, and the like. In short, with increasing prosperity, consumers shift to spending a higher percentage of their money on services. Many services, of course, are customized and delivered directly to clients; they are largely knowledge and information. In the Internet age, this intellectual output can be carved up into bits and bytes and sent nearly anywhere on this planet in a few seconds for a few pennies.\n\nIn the United States, we shifted our buying from goods to services as we grew richer. Other rich countries have done the same. There is no reason to believe that the next group of countries climbing the income ladder will behave any differently. That brings us to China and India, two populous nations that in the past decade have stirred from a long slumber and taken off on fast-growth paths. As they’ve opened up to the rest of the world, 2.5 billion consumers have been added to the world economy.\n\nMany commentators portray the emergence of China and India as a threat. We hear about a flood of Chinese manufactured goods costing U.S. factory jobs. We hear about the outsourcing of jobs to India eroding U.S. service industries. These are actual phenomena. But it is also true—and this we rarely hear about—that these and other emerging countries are not just selling to world markets, they are buying from them, too. Imports as a share of China’s economy more than doubled in the past decade to 33 percent. India’s import share has tripled to 23 percent.\n\nTo a Dallasite or a Chicagoan, that is the sound of opportunity knocking. Let me give you a few examples. At forecasted growth rates, we calculate that China will add $116 billion to world demand for medical care in just one year. India will contribute an additional $25 billion. Together, the incremental demand for medical care from just these two markets will be more than four times larger than the contribution from the U.S. Turning to global spending on recreational services, one year’s added demand comes to $79 billion from China and $16 billion from India, compared with $23 billion from the U.S. Down the line, these gains should be even bigger, provided China and India continue to grow their economies.\n\nNow throw in all the services beyond medical care and recreation. Then consider the world beyond China and India, a mix of emerging nations and traditional markets, most seeing their incomes rise. This is new business. Their domestic producers will meet a good chunk of the added demand, but China, India and other countries will shop the globe for what they cannot find at home or what is better elsewhere. Here, we have advantages in many areas. Medicine, finance, education, legal services, forensics, architecture and design, engineering technology, film and other aspects of entertainment—in these service areas and more, America is second to none.\n\nTo be sure, we must compete with the Brits, the Europeans, the Japanese, the Aussies and everyone else for this business. But U.S. firms have already proven to be stellar at selling their services to the world. We already export more services than any other nation—by a long shot. Our foreign sales of nearly $500 billion in 2007 exceeded the combined total of the next two services exporters, Britain and Germany. Better still, most of what we sell abroad are highly valued services—and the numbers prove it.\n\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis divvies up services exports into 20 categories. In three-fourths of them, U.S. exports exceed imports. Our edge is nearly 24 to 1 in industrial engineering, which includes American technicians who install computerized control systems, design industrial robots and streamline supply chains. Marquees all over the world tout our movies, and we have a 13-to-1 trade ratio in the distribution of films and television shows. We are crackerjack suppliers of construction services, information management, legal and financial services, and education. Because of our deep reservoir of copyrights and patents, what we receive from foreigners in licensing fees and royalties exceeds what we pay to other countries by better than 2 to 1.\n\nAll told, our service exports exceed imports in 15 of 20 categories. In 10 categories, our service exports are more than double our imports—some exceeding even 10 times as much, such as medical services, TV and film, and industrial engineering. In only two service categories are our imports more than double our exports—freight and insurance.\n\nThe United States developed its services prowess here at home. Our companies learned how to deliver services efficiently and effectively by meeting the needs of a highly sophisticated, evolving domestic economy. To fill the ranks of these companies, our colleges and universities educated doctors, lawyers, architects and managers. The next logical step has always been to sell this expertise to foreign customers.\n\nWe should not overlook the revolution in communications and information technology that has spread around the world in the past two decades, a revolution that was conceived and delivered and nurtured to maturity in the laboratories and universities of the United States. The economics textbooks I had in college told me it was far easier to export goods than services. Physical things could be mass produced, crated, put on ships, warehoused and sold abroad. Most services, in contrast, had to be delivered directly to clients. They faced obstacles in export markets largely because of technological limitations and the high costs involved with communications, travel and information transmittal.\n\nThese barriers to services trade have been crumbling. The story goes back to the late 1960s, with the Defense Department’s project for decentralizing communications, which a few decades later grew into the Internet we know today. In the mid-1970s, the two Steves—Jobs and Wozniak—sold their first Apple I, the first step toward the desktops and laptops that keep today’s businesses humming. Information Age technology expands the range of services that can be delivered over great distances. It makes it cheaper and easier to find and interact with customers overseas.\n\nThe upshot is changing trading patterns. The growth rate for U.S. exports was faster for goods than services until the early 1980s. Then, foreign sales of services began rising faster than goods. Since 1985, our services exports have grown nearly 260 percent, eclipsing the 200 percent growth in goods exports. Today, services represent nearly 30 percent of our overseas sales.\n\nWe can expect our trade to continue its transition from goods to services. I assure you this is indeed good news, particularly welcome at a time of widespread anxiety about creating good jobs and maintaining high and growing median income levels. Exporting more services will help us do both.\n\nToo often, services get a bad rap. The hamburger-flipper stereotype of services jobs would have us believe that they are innately and unalterably inferior to goods-producing jobs. That simply is not true. Yes, there are low-paying jobs in services, just as there are low-paying ones in goods, but the average services worker today makes more than the average factory worker. If we look back to 1990, we see that hourly wages have grown faster in services than manufacturing for all service categories except transportation and warehousing.\n\nAverage manufacturing earnings stood at $16.40 an hour in 2007, excluding overtime. Finance, insurance and real estate workers earned $19.66 an hour. Professional and business services were at $20.14 an hour and information services at $23.92 an hour. Utilities paid their workers $27.93. Only retail trade and leisure and hospitality paid significantly less than manufacturing in 2007—and these are industries that for the most part don’t require advanced skills and employ large numbers of students and many young people just starting their careers.\n\nProductivity determines pay. And America’s services workers are among the world’s most productive, with an average worker’s output at $80,000. U.S. services providers are productive because they’re well educated and highly skilled. The capital of our times is human, not mechanical. Yesterday’s factory workers brought strong backs, steady eyes and sure hands to the production process, while the capitalist provided the buildings and machinery. Today’s service companies may provide office space and computers, but the workers create value with their minds. The engine of the knowledge economy can be found not in sooty factories but atop our necks: It is the human brain. This is particularly true of the services we export, which skew toward the highly sophisticated output of well-educated and skilled workers.\n\nEconomic theory tells us that nations will export what can be produced by factors they have in relative abundance. This is the principle of comparative advantage. Countries with significant mineral wealth will sell oil or copper. Those with large tracts of fertile land will sell wheat, corn or beef. Those with cheap labor and large stocks of machinery—think China—will sell run-of-the-mill factory goods. America’s highly knowledgeable and experienced services workers are our nation’s relatively abundant factor. That is what we sell to the world. That is where our future lies.\n\nAnother of my favorite prime ministers was Winston Churchill. In the early years of the 20th century, Britain had a donnybrook of a debate—with Churchill and his free traders pitted against Joseph Chamberlain and the protectionists. Churchill saw how global competition would push a nation to make higher value-added products. Here is how he put it: “The country in which the superfine processes are performed—in which the superfine, the most complicated terminal stages of manufacture are performed—is the country which possesses what may be called commercial ‘leadership.’ ” Today, I would broaden Churchill’s words to emphasize services and find commercial leadership in nations, like ours, that possess the talents and experience needed to provide the highest-valued services.\n\nThe answer to competition from the new countries that have joined the capitalist race is not to wrap ourselves in the toxic, defensive mantle of protectionism. That is akin to embracing inflation as a remedy to the credit market correction. The answer is to go on the offensive, to master and dominate the “superfine processes.” We must continue climbing the value-added ladder into the most profitable and productive services. We must exploit this competitive advantage, so we can continue growing our economy and expanding the welfare of our citizens.\n\nWe in Dallas, like you here in Chicago, are working diligently to sell our services to the rest of the world. Progressive cities all over this great country are making yet another sweeping transition—this time, to thinking and acting globally in the services arena—that promises to pave a path that will allow us to remain the world’s premier economy for many, many years to come.\n\nCharlie, let me conclude by going back to my books and quoting another Charlie—Charles Eliot, who was Harvard’s president for 40 years. He once said, “Books are the quietest and most constant of friends; they are the most accessible and wisest of counselors and the most patient of teachers.” I hope that in the essay you will find in the little, accessible book that is our annual report some wise counsel and a quiet but reassuring ray of sunshine for this otherwise dark and impatient world.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "April 9, 2008 San Antonio, Texas\n\nThank you, Dick. I admire Dick Evans for many reasons. He is a smart banker. He is a devoted San Antonian. He is a superb member of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’ board of directors. And he is married to Jimmie Ruth, who is living proof that men, even Dick Evans, can always be improved upon.\n\nThe name Ruth evokes memories of my godmother, Ruth Walgren, who had a vivid sense of humor. She lived to a very ripe old age and used to tell a story that went something like this: Two women, Ruth and Emma, lived well into their 90s, surviving their husbands and practically all their friends in their little town. They had been best friends all their lives, growing up just a few doors from each other and living just a few blocks apart since childhood. Age finally caught up with Ruth. In her final hours she told Emma: “You know what I remember most fondly? Softball. My favorite thing in my long life was playing softball when we were girls. We were carefree and happy and everything was just so perfect. Oh, Emma, I pray there is a softball team in heaven.”\n\n“My dear and oldest friend,” Emma said, “I loved playing softball too. If there is softball in heaven, will you send me a signal and let me know?”\n\n“I will, I promise,” said Ruth, and with that she smiled, closed her eyes and passed on.\n\nSeveral weeks later, on a Sunday night, Emma was peacefully lying in her bed. Suddenly a flash of intense light hovered above her bed. Ruth appeared as an angel. “Emma,” she said, “I have good news and I have bad news.”\n\n“Oh, Ruthie,” Emma said, “tell me the good news.”\n\n“The good news, Emma, is that there is a softball team in heaven! All of our friends from girlhood are here and so are our old teammates. We are all carefree girls again. We play all day in perfect weather. We never get tired. And we are happy, happy, happy and will be for eternity. It is truly heavenly.”\n\n“Oh, Ruth, that is so wonderful,” Emma replied. “What better news could I have received on this fine Sunday night? What could possibly be the bad news?”\n\n“Well,” said Ruth, “the bad news is you are pitching on Tuesday.”\n\nSo often, just when all seems so good and just right, we receive an abrupt warning that things are about to change, that we are going to be yanked from our comfortable existence and into the unknown. At that moment, we realize we have been enjoying a false sense of comfort. The outlook suddenly becomes less certain, even bleak, and we panic, wondering just how to deal with our new predicament. This is especially true in economics.\n\nLast Thursday, the Financial Times published a pithy little letter by Alex Pollock, a resident fellow of the American Enterprise Institute, questioning the assertion of a column written some days earlier about the financial markets that had stated “we are in unknown territory facing situations that have never arisen before.” Pollock’s response was that the current bursting of the housing bubble exhibits time-honored boom–bust traditions. And then he penned this zinger: “In booms it is proclaimed that we are in a ‘new era’—in busts that we have ‘unprecedented problems.’ This is merely the egocentricity of the present.”\n\nI would like to talk today about the “egocentricity of the present” as it relates to the economy. What is the nature of the bubble we have experienced and what are the dynamics of the bust? How is it affecting Texas? What is the proper role of the Federal Reserve in dealing with the situation? And what might Texans do about it?\n\nTo begin, we need to spend a moment pondering the nature of risk. Perceptions of risk lie in the eye of the beholder. Some see risk as a powerful force vital to capitalism; others consider it a four-letter word. The latter view may be gaining currency these days, as risks taken in housing finance have led to considerable stress in financial markets and weakness in the overall economy.\n\nWe must not forget that prudent risk taking is the lifeblood of capitalism, especially in the American form of capitalism where we are constantly replacing the old with the new, and the familiar with the new and the innovative. If we had not taken risks, we would never have created from scratch the $14 trillion U.S. economy.\n\nEvery one of us takes risks to advance our interests. A young person who goes to college, for example, risks the certain income from today’s job, believing in the probability of a better paying one after graduation. As we accumulate excess savings, we place them at risk by investing in stocks and bonds to secure our retirement. We take risks by borrowing to build our businesses, with the expectation that a brighter future will enable us to repay our debts and then some.\n\nOf course, we also strive to manage risk. Once we are in the workforce, life insurance, for example, hedges the risk that we might die before we have socked away enough money to provide for our families. A prudent banker like Dick Evans drills down into the businesses he is lending to and knows them like the back of his hand in order to minimize risks to his short-term depositors from providing businesses with long-term financing. And so on.\n\nThe necessity of risk taking as a pillar of market capitalism has also given rise to agents to service it. Insurers and banks are two such agents, as are investment banks, money managers, hedge funds and other financial intermediaries that provide the means to assess, package and distribute risk. In the old days, their job was fairly straightforward. The agents packaged straight-up risk instruments like letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, commercial paper, simple loans and stocks, life and property insurance and fixed-rate mortgages. More recently, with the aid of technology and computational power that can assess probabilities at lightning speeds, the menu of risk instruments expanded dramatically. Financial intermediaries began offering exotic products to satisfy almost any risk taker’s needs anywhere in the world at any time. Hunger for the new risk products was stimulated by a lengthy period of abnormally low interest rates and the normal human instinct to look for ever-higher yields when the returns on orthodox financial instruments, like U.S. Treasuries, municipal bonds or bank CDs, become ho-hum.\n\nOf course, like exotic foods, consumption of new risk products can lead to indigestion, and even allergic reactions. Lately, we have witnessed many allergic reactions—in the form of losses and setbacks—especially among money center banks and other financial institutions whose fiduciary eyes—as old Ruth Walgren would have said—“simply got too big for their stomachs.” What began as isolated pockets of trouble in the U.S. housing market soon spread to global markets in mortgage-backed securities, where many of the exotic home mortgage products were gobbled up. Soon it became obvious that financial market participants were gagging on the many types of “structured” credit products—not just those backed by mortgages—they were being served. As we approached the summer of 2007, this gag reflex reached a pinnacle; the larger banks found it difficult, if not impossible, to sell to others many types of loans; and the interbank lending market experienced intense liquidity pressures as banks became fearful of lending to each other for longer than overnight.\n\nJust when things seemed so comfortable, when we were so happy as an economy, it is as though we settled down for a peaceful night’s sleep on a Sunday night this past August, only to learn we would be called to pitch on Tuesday, but with less pleasant prospects than those of our fictional friend Emma. We’ve seen yet another historical cycle of excess risk-taking—in this case, concentrated in financial innovations in credit and structured finance served up and consumed without regard for the downside—followed by extreme risk aversion.\n\nThis round of speculation and financial amnesia seems to have been driven by a combination of factors, including an over-reliance on statistical models and rating agencies, excessive liquidity and perverse incentives compounded by an excess of complacency.\n\nIn assessing the situation, don’t let anyone convince you that we’ve entered a “new era.” The details may be different, but we’ve been here before. Allow me to temper the ego of the present by recalling the not-too-distant past and the events that happened right here in Texas.\n\nIn the 1980s, the euphoria of oil prices around $100 a barrel in today’s dollars led to a frenzy of lending activity in Texas. At least I think that’s what any reasonable observer would call the annual growth rate of business loans of over 40 percent at Texas banks and annual growth in commercial real estate lending of almost 50 percent that we saw in the early part of that decade. Booking assets at such a rapid clip has a seductive power. My favorite line from the musical “Evita” is when she belts out, “All I want is a whole lot of excess!” Well, we certainly pursued excess here in the 1980s. In pursuit of a seemingly sure thing, more than 550 new banks were chartered in Texas from 1980 through 1985. This made for a volatile brew, combining dramatic rates of growth in activity with a dramatic expansion of the number of players with limited experience in knowing what to do when things go wrong. The assumption of permanently high, or permanently rising, prices in an asset class—in this case, oil—invariably leads to regrettable decisions.\n\nYou recall what ensued. Real oil prices began to fall, contributing to an economic slowdown in the region’s most energy-sensitive areas, such as Houston. The regional economy held its own for a while, propelled by a red-hot commercial real estate sector. The state economy suffered a severe decline, however, when oil collapsed to the current equivalent of around $22 per barrel by mid-1986. Bank and thrift failures reached a frightful magnitude. More than 800 financial institutions went out of business in Texas during the 1980s and into the early 1990s. Nine of the 10 largest banking organizations based in Texas didn’t make it—the exception being Dick Evans’ Cullen Frost.\n\nThe energy bust reverberated through Texas, and it was keenly felt in both commercial and residential real estate markets. Office vacancies soared. In Dallas and Houston, they hovered around 30 percent, and they approached 40 percent in Austin. Employment growth flatlined and recession ensued.\n\nThe nation’s current difficulties took root not in the oil market, but in the U.S. housing market. After several years of startling increases in home prices and financing activity, things began to unravel several quarters ago. But the roots of the current crisis were like those of earlier bubbles. They originated in the seductive power of price escalation—of a “whole lot of excess”—and the egocentricity of the present, which led some to believe we had entered a “new era.” We either didn’t notice this elaborate conceit or failed to deal with it. But it was there. Many coastal areas of the U.S. were beginning to see 20 to 30 percent year-over-year increases in house prices, some even as high as 30 to 40 percent. Subprime mortgage borrowing, or lending to less creditworthy individuals by lenders who were eager to finance a “sure thing,” exploded. The good news is that levels of homeownership among the U.S. population reached unprecedented heights, extending the American dream to more people than ever before. The bad news is that the methods used to do so were not sustainable.\n\nLet me give you some numbers to focus the mind. In 1999, before home prices started to defy gravity, 55 percent of homes sold in the New York metro area were considered affordable to the median-income family by one industry gauge. When home prices peaked at the end of 2006, that percentage had fallen to just 5 percent. In Los Angeles in 1999, 43 percent of homes were affordable to the median-income family, but only 2 percent were by the end of 2006. Two percent! Compare that to Texas. In Dallas in 1999, 64 percent of homes were affordable; by 2006, that percentage had barely slipped to 62 percent. In Austin, home prices actually became more affordable over this period, in contrast to the U.S. as a whole.\n\nThe chairman of Presidents Nixon and Ford’s Council of Economic Advisers, Herb Stein, was fond of saying that, “if something cannot go on forever, it will stop.” Eventually the conceit of a “new era” in housing could not go on forever, and it stopped. The bubble popped, and a harsh correction has ensued.\n\nWith that abridged historical background, let’s turn back to the financial markets. We saw a wave of innovative mortgage products during the housing boom. Indeed, there would have been no other way for many borrowers to have procured financing without these new mortgage products.\n\nThese innovations in financing took two forms. First, credit-scoring models enabled lenders to better sort and price mortgages made to nonprime borrowers. The second set of innovations allowed these loans to be funded and sold to a new class of investors. While traditional mortgages had long been securitized and sold through government-sponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the securitization market ushered in new players from the private sector who would hold nonprime mortgages that could not meet the standards of Fannie and Freddie and that banks would generally not hold in portfolios.\n\nThese so-called structured credit products became all the rage with investors. These new and complex securities sliced and diced risk into different tranches. It was thought that the collateralized debt obligations and collateralized loan obligations could be hedged with credit default swaps to make them seem almost risk free. And, if you could do so with mortgage loans, why not credit card loans, auto loans and other types of debt?\n\nThings began to unravel once it became apparent that the housing bubble could not expand forever. Losses began to be recorded on traditional mortgage-backed securities, with the newer types of structured finance products used to securitize the newer types of mortgage lending being especially hard hit. It didn’t stop there. Banks in other countries that had invested in the too-good-to-be-true U.S. housing market through these products began to record large losses. Even some that weren’t directly involved in the U.S. housing sector or these products still felt the repercussions; who could have imagined that house price declines in the U.S. would contribute to a bank run in England?\n\nAll types of structured credit products soon came under suspicion. Issuance of asset-backed commercial paper declined sharply beginning last summer. Although some of that paper was backed by mortgages, not all of it was. But that didn’t seem to matter. The market for auction rate municipal bonds was also hit, as doubts spread regarding the financial health of the misnamed “monoline” insurers. Investment banks also experienced abnormal difficulties in the usually routine task of syndicating their leveraged loans in the private equity sphere, which is fairly remote from the mortgage industry, to say the least.\n\nThe banking industry was smack in the middle of this maelstrom. This sector is of obvious importance to the Federal Reserve. Not surprisingly, large losses have been recorded at some of the largest banks. Their capital ratios are also under pressure from the fallout in the securitization markets. The difficulty in selling loans and the increase in lending to borrowers who were shut out of the securitization markets have increased banks’ exposure. In addition, some banks that offered off-balance-sheet commitments to their structured investment vehicles, or SIVs, have found themselves having to move these assets onto their balance sheets. All this asset on-boarding has pressured capital ratios. Combine these pressures with the difficulty of establishing values for structured credit products in seized-up markets and it is no surprise that term interbank lending thinned out considerably.\n\nThat’s what happened. There will be lots of theories as to how it happened. Mine is fairly straightforward: however many “quants” from MIT or Cal Tech or UT San Antonio you bring in to build models that theorize away risk, there is no overturning the fundamental law that the price of an asset is determined by what someone is willing to pay for it. Mathematical models complement judgment and experience but are no substitute for them. Judgment and experience, including our own vivid experience here in Texas in the 1980s, teach us that in booms and bubbles, prices overshoot and during busts, they overcorrect.\n\nTo a great extent, the bubble in housing was a classic case of the bigger-fool theory and efficient-market theory run amok. The excesses in subprime lending in the United States were fed by an excessive amount of faith in technically sophisticated approaches to risk management and a misguided belief that mathematical models could price securitized assets, including securities based on mortgages, accurately. These valuation methodologies were so technical and mathematically sophisticated that their utter complexity lulled many people into a false sense of security. In the end, complexity proved hopelessly inadequate as an all-encompassing measure of risk, despite its frequent advertisement as such. The risk models employed turned out to be merely formulaic descriptions of the past and created an illusion of precision. Such approaches could not and cannot replace the forward-looking judgment of a seasoned professional.\n\nSeasoned investors and creditors know that incomplete information—or information asymmetry, in technical jargon—is a fact of life in financial markets. In fact, the presence of information asymmetries goes a long way toward explaining the structure of financial markets and institutions. In our system, we have implemented a process of “delegated monitoring” to address these asymmetries.\n\nLet me explain what I mean by “delegated monitoring.” Because an individual saver would be hard-pressed to monitor the many potential borrowers to whom they could lend, they have delegated that monitoring role to their bank, which then is in charge of keeping tabs on borrowers. In the U.S., where the safety of deposits at most banks is federally guaranteed, regulators are a delegated monitor, loosely speaking, watching over banks on behalf of their collective depositors.\n\nThe regulators also are not above delegating some work. Rather than attempting to monitor the entire universe of financial institutions, U.S. regulators rely heavily on a core group of very large money center banks with significant exposures, expecting them to act as delegated monitors, disciplining the remaining players in the financial system through effective controls on counterparty risk by assessing and limiting the risk of other banks, hedge funds and private equity firms. And finally, regulators and investors alike have come to depend on ratings agencies to assess and monitor firms and securities on their behalf.\n\nAll these complex monitoring arrangements are motivated, at least in part, by the fact that information is costly. Yet it seems to me that a lot of our recent problems can be attributed to breakdowns in this chain of delegated monitoring. To this end, the secretary of the Treasury has put forward recommendations to modernize and clarify the chain of command of delegated monitoring. We are studying the recommendations he has made—as is the Congress and others—and will contemplate them dispassionately over time.\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve is doing its level best to facilitate the process of price discovery and adjustment from a period of excess in a manner that restores the efficacy of the financial system.\n\nHere is a simple analogy to help you think about our effort. The Federal Reserve is charged with conducting monetary policy that sustains noninflationary economic growth. We have at our disposal a tool called the federal funds rate, which we set as the base lending rate for the economy. Think of the fed funds rate as a monetary spigot, and the Fed’s goal is keeping the lawn of the economy green and healthy. If we turn the spigot up too forcefully, we will flood and kill the grass with inflation. If we provide too little, the lawn turns brown, starved for money. To get the money from the spigot to the lawn requires a working system of pipes and sprinkler heads. The “shadow banking system,” however, looks like a Rube Goldberg device designed by a hydrologist on acid, with pipes and conduits that lead every which way and not always toward the goal of sustainable economic growth. Moreover, the system of pipes and outlets is clogged with the muck and residue of a prolonged and frenetic period of unrestrained growth and abuse. Until the confusion and the debris are cleared away, financial intermediaries will be reluctant to book new loans or incur additional risk. This retards the impact of additional monetary accommodation.\n\nThus, even as we have been cutting the fed funds rate—even as we have been opening the monetary spigot—interest rates for private sector borrowers have not fallen correspondingly, and rates for some borrowers have increased. The grass is turning brown.\n\nTo address this problem, we have created some new facilities that should provide a liquidity bridge over the currently dysfunctional system while the marketplace and regulators—ourselves included—go about restoring the system’s plumbing.\n\nThe term auction facility—known by its acronym, TAF—was introduced in December as an entirely new approach to funding problems at banks. Those who are eligible for primary credit at the Fed’s traditional discount window can now bid at bimonthly auctions for term funds. So far, the auctions have been well-subscribed and term funding pressures abated after the introduction of the TAF. The term securities lending facility we announced last month expands the Fed’s securities lending program. Securities will now be made available through an auction process with an expanded array of collateral on a weekly basis for a term of 28 days. We also set up a primary dealer credit facility, an overnight lending facility that provides funding to primary dealers in exchange for a range of eligible collateral. And, at the request of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Board of Governors of the Fed approved a loan to J. P. Morgan so that that bank might digest the exposure that many counterparties had to Bear Stearns, without rewarding Bear Stearns shareholders for the imprudent risks assumed by their management.\n\nTo repeat, the objective of all this activity is to provide a bridge for the financial system while it transitions from a period of indiscriminate excess and gets back to normalcy. I do not believe the Fed should be, or is, “bailing out” any particular institution. Nor do I personally believe that any institution in and of itself is “too big to fail.” But I do believe that we must have a financial system that is in working order. We must have a system where the chain of delegated monitors operates smoothly and efficiently. We must have a system where the pipes that nourish capitalism sustain the fertile lawn that is the American economy. It is the Fed’s duty as lender of last resort to lead the way to restoring the efficacy of the financial system.\n\nThe Fed has made some tough judgment calls lately, and, having been party to making those calls, I can assure you they certainly were not made lightly. In principle, we know that the market should decide the winners and losers, who survives and who fails. I am a big fan of Winston Churchill. “It is always more easy to discover and proclaim general principles than to apply them,” Churchill said. I now know full well what he meant.\n\nLooking to the future, and in summary, the emerging discussion on new regulations and a new supervisory framework should proceed, but regulations by themselves cannot replace good judgment by individual investors or bankers or financiers, and certainly by policymakers. Policymakers need to remain vigilant in seeking the right balance between prudent and indiscriminate risk taking. But the elimination of risk—and the consequences of incurring risk—can never be the goal of any policymaker in a capitalist system. In building the bridge to restore financial order and efficiency, my primary interest is to do the minimum necessary to get the job done. And no more. In so doing, my hope is that we restore the long-term faith of the millions of risk takers who make our economy so mighty.\n\nHaving used the term “mighty,” let me turn to Texas. Texas’ housing, as mentioned earlier, is affordable. Our industrial mix creates jobs that are appealing. People continue to move here from the high-priced East and West Coasts and the Midwest, where the job market has been softer. We are a thriving engine of growth in an otherwise anemic economy.\n\nHere are some data to prove the point. Between 2004 and 2007, job growth in the expensive cities on the East and West Coasts was 4 percent or less. In manufacturing-oriented cities of the Midwest, the job market was weaker, with Cleveland and Detroit posting declines. By contrast, between 2004 and 2007 employment in Dallas grew by 8.9 percent. In Houston, by over 12 percent! Last year, almost one-third of all the private sector jobs created across America were created in our state. Let me repeat that: Over 30 percent of all the private sector jobs created in America last year were created right here in the Lone Star State.\n\nAs a Texan speaking to a room full of Texans, I would be remiss if I didn’t offer my two cents about what this state ought to be doing in times like these. Before he became president, Jack Kennedy reminded an audience that the Chinese character for the word “crisis” has two brush strokes. One stroke means danger, the other means opportunity. As Kennedy so wisely put it, “In a crisis, be aware of the danger but recognize the opportunity.”\n\nThe housing crisis may not yet have run its course, and further danger could lie ahead both for the nation and also for Texas. We may seem isolated from the rest of the nation’s woes, but we are not immune from the dangers they pose. Still, as I survey the Texan economic landscape, I sense we have an opportunity here. Our economy is growing. We’re an affordable and wonderful place to live. And we hunger for workers—as recently as this morning I heard anecdotal reports of labor shortages in parts of Texas.\n\nThe U.S. economy will continue to suffer from a bout of anemia while the housing and financial markets settle down. I take comfort, however, in knowing that markets eventually clear if we at the Fed do our job and the other regulators and fiscal authorities do theirs. Even in the egocentric present, when gloomy analysts lament “unprecedented problems,” we must never lose faith in the economic machine that has propelled the U.S. economy to unprecedented prosperity. You need look no further than to what is happening in our own state for proof of our nation’s inherent resiliency. All I ask of you as San Antonians and as Texans is that you continue to serve as the exemplar of what can be accomplished by properly managing risk and turning “unprecedented problems” into unrivaled opportunities, as Americans have done time and time again.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "March 7, 2008 Paris, France\n\nFirst, I’d like to thank Governor [Christian] Noyer for the invitation to participate in this conference. The topic could not be more timely, and it is one that is close to my heart. It is a great privilege to discuss this paper by Ken Rogoff.\n\nWhen I took office as president of the Dallas Fed three years ago, I made it clear that I wanted our signature research issue for the coming years to be the study of the implications of globalization for the conduct of monetary policy in the U.S. To this end, we have created a Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute and have assembled a blue-ribbon advisory board that includes Ken Rogoff among its members.\n\nLet me start by posing a rhetorical question. Should the default framework for thinking about monetary policy in a country like the U.S. or, indeed, in the euro area, be an open economy where capital flows across national borders, goods and services are sourced from the cheapest global suppliers, interest rate movements in one country impact rates in another, and exchange rates factor in firms’ pricing and production decisions? Or can we get by thinking in closed-economy terms, where domestic investment is financed with domestic savings, we only consume what we produce, interest rates are determined at home and exchange rates are irrelevant? Nobody who has lived on the planet since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the ascendancy of Deng Xiaoping would likely testify to the validity of the second proposition. Globalization means that we can no longer guide policy by ignoring trade and capital flows or the invisible but nonetheless effective links between countries that have been forged through cyberspace. Yet it appears to me that the default framework for thinking about monetary policy continues to be the closed-economy model.\n\nNow on to Professor Rogoff’s paper. Ken’s paper starts with a review of some of the salient facts about globalization and segues to a discussion about the seeming resilience of the globalized world economy and the important role that better monetary policy plays in ensuring that resilience. He then proceeds with a discussion of the central role China seems to be playing in the recent acceleration of globalization, assesses its impact on global commodity prices and then wraps up with a very nice discussion of whether the recent subprime crisis is all that different from previous banking crises.\n\nGlobalization means different things to different people. To the Chinese peasant it may mean the prospect of an end to poverty and steady improvement in his living standards. To the American or French factory worker it may mean the threat of cheap imports and the potential outsourcing of his or her job. To the environmental activist it may mean the despoliation of the earth’s atmosphere as more countries industrialize and pour pollutants into the atmosphere. To the public intellectual it may mean the loss of national identity and the Americanization of culture. There are many important dimensions to globalization, but as a central banker, I am most interested in the economic dimensions, namely the greater integration of national economies through increased trade of goods and services, investment, migration, and task allocation. All of these facilitate the dissemination of ideas and technologies that are another key manifestation of globalization and indeed contribute to its spread.\n\nHowever, it is extraordinarily difficult to get a good handle on just how rapidly the world is globalizing. As Ken notes, there is a lot of hype out there about how many new workers and consumers have become part of the global economy as a result of the demise of communism and the opening of China, India and other economies. The raw numbers in terms of population are huge—we are talking billions with a “b”—but the true extent to which the workers in these countries are, for want of a better word, substitutable for workers in advanced economies is an open question. It is this substitutability that determines how the coming on line of this new labor force will impact the wages of workers in the advanced economies. It would appear that the number of workers in countries like China and India who possess skills comparable to those found among the workforces of the U.S., Europe and other advanced nations is a small subset of the headline numbers.\n\nIt is worth reminding the audience that the nominal per capita income of the average Chinese citizen today is, in inflation-adjusted terms, roughly equivalent to that of an American worker in the early 1900s. And yet, for those workers who possess the skills demanded by a modern economy, wages have rapidly approached advanced-economy levels. There are abundant anecdotal reports that the salaries of top programmers in Mumbai are quickly converging to those of their peers in Silicon Valley. Likewise, there is rapid wage growth for managers in China who can work in Western companies. Indeed, just last week the Financial Times reported on million-dollar bonuses paid to certain Chinese executives in the financial sector. But the vast majority of the new workers in the global economy at present bring little more than their raw labor and thirst for betterment.\n\nTechnological improvements and policy changes have both been important drivers of globalization. The information technology revolution has played an important role in breaking down the barrier between those goods and services that were hitherto thought to be tradable across national borders and those that were not. Services that were long considered to be the quintessential nontradable good are increasingly traded internationally. If you do the numbers, you will find that the U.S. exports a lot more services than it imports, and moving up the value-added chain into more service-oriented sectors is key to the continued competitiveness of the U.S. economy.\n\nBy some measures, financial globalization has proceeded even more rapidly than the “real” globalization that is rooted in trade flows. In some sense, this is not too surprising. While innovations in transportation technology—such as the inventions of container shipping and the jumbo jet that Ken mentions in his presentation—have helped reduce the effective geographic distance between countries, making it easier to trade goods, distance in a very fundamental sense still matters for trade. However, the information technology revolution has effectively eliminated the idea of geographic distance in financial and several other service transactions. Financial trades can be executed at any time of the day in any part of the world at the click of a mouse. Architectural renderings can be created thousands of miles from the firm that commissions them. X-rays and CAT scans of patients in Dallas or Paris can be analyzed in Sydney or Delhi while their Texan or French doctors sleep. As long as the earth rotates on its axis and satellite and Internet connections are maintained, technology never sleeps in a globalized world, nor does the production of other goods and services.\n\nGlobalization is not new. Some of the key technical innovations that make today’s globalization possible are a half century old or older. But it is perhaps worth emphasizing that much of the globalization that occurred in the immediate post-World War II period was simply getting us back to where we were on the eve of World War I. As is well known, by the early 1970s, trade flows had gotten back to where they were in 1913, but other key dimensions of globalization, capital flows and migration, were still well below their pre-World War I levels. Indeed, the reversal of globalization in the interwar period is something we should never forget and serves as a reminder that we cannot take a liberal international economic order for granted.\n\nWriting shortly after the end of World War I, John Maynard Keynes commented on how thoroughly “internationalized” (his expression) the world was in 1913. It is worth repeating what he said: “The inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various products of the whole earth, in such quantity as he might see fit, and reasonably expect their early delivery upon his door-step; …[and] at the same moment and by the same means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world, and share, without exertion or even trouble, in their prospective fruits and advantages; or he could decide to couple the security of his fortunes with the good faith of the townspeople of any substantial municipality in any continent that fancy or information might recommend. He could secure forthwith, if he wished it, cheap and comfortable means of transit to any country or climate without passport or other formality, could dispatch his servant to the neighboring office of a bank for such supply of the precious metals as might seem convenient, and could then proceed abroad to foreign quarters, without knowledge of their religion, language, or customs, bearing coined wealth upon his person, and would consider himself greatly aggrieved and much surprised at the least interference.” Most important of all, this average inhabitant of London “…regarded this state of affairs as normal, certain, and permanent, except in the direction of further improvement, and any deviation from it as aberrant, scandalous, and avoidable.”\n\nThat rather bucolic description of globalization as it once was practiced was penned by Keynes in The Economic Consequences of the Peace in 1919. It seems unlikely that the unique set of circumstances that led to the collapse of globalization between the great wars of the twentieth century will ever be repeated, but newer twenty-first century challenges could just as easily impede the progress of globalization.\n\nTaking a very long-term perspective on globalization, looking at it from the perspective of centuries and not just decades, also teaches us something about the role of the monetary standard in promoting international economic integration. The nominal stability associated with the gold standard played an important role in fostering globalization in the nineteenth century. The transition to a fiat standard created some challenges for central bankers, but in recent years central bankers have come to a better understanding of how they need to conduct monetary policy under a fiat standard and have done a good job at delivering price stability. Ken is right: High inflation is much rarer now, with only two countries experiencing what might be considered very high or hyperinflations. This greater nominal stability is a key factor underlying the surge of globalization over the past decade and a half and remains vital to continued progress.\n\nBut how resilient are the new monetary frameworks? Is the adoption of formal or informal inflation targeting the key to central bank successes in recent years, or have they been the beneficiaries of a dollop of good luck in the form of higher productivity growth? Better monetary policy helped make greater globalization and faster productivity growth possible, but globalization and faster productivity growth also made the jobs of central bankers easier. The more challenging circumstances that have developed over the recent past—as the tailwinds that ensued from the addition of new workers to the production side of global output have morphed into headwinds of demand for scarce resources—will serve to stress-test the new monetary policy frameworks in ways they have not been tested before.\n\nNo discussion of globalization would be complete without some mention of China’s extraordinary growth over the past decade. The raw numbers are staggering, from the rapid urbanization of its population to the extraordinary increases in output year after year and the voracious demand for raw materials as it becomes the workshop of the world. Ken asks what would happen to the favorable inflation and productivity environment if internal stresses in Chinese society were to cause the authorities to slow down or even reverse some of the recent market reforms. There can be little doubt that the Chinese authorities face a gargantuan task in managing the transition of the economy to a free-market system. Recent strains have manifested themselves in higher inflation, and the ability of the authorities to control that inflation is clearly hindered by the exchange-rate regime. Greater exchange-rate flexibility will enhance the ability of the People’s Bank of China to deliver price stability, the surest contribution any central bank can make to improvements in living standards over the long term.\n\nGlobalization does matter for inflation, but not in the ways that are often suggested in the media. The most common fallacy is, of course, the confusion of relative price with price level changes, the idea that a flood of cheap imports from China must of necessity lower the price level and the inflation rate. The channels whereby globalization affects inflation are much more subtle and not always necessarily benign. Furthermore, I believe that different dimensions of globalization affect the dynamics of inflation in fundamentally different ways.\n\nLet’s start with trade. The availability of cheap imports from China and other countries does have a direct and indirect impact on domestic prices and inflation. There has been a significant amount of work in recent years trying to document the size of this effect. The estimates vary, but they are generally significant. But the mechanism whereby the price changes are realized is subtle. Yes, there is a direct effect through the availability of cheaper imports. When those cheaper imports are inputs into the production process, we know they directly lower prices at home. The price effect is not just relative, but absolute. But that will be offset to some extent as consumers use their enhanced purchasing power to buy more of other products, putting upward pressure on prices. The threat of competition also has an effect on the pricing decisions of domestic firms, both for firms producing products that are close substitutes for the imported goods and for firms that use those imports as inputs. Cheaper imports will also have an impact on the wage demands of workers who consume those goods. Of course, the effect is not all in one direction, as Ken notes in his paper. The downside of the rapid growth in production in low-wage countries is the upward pressure that this growth has put on commodity prices worldwide. Faster growth in incomes is having a significant effect on global food prices, although some of the recent increases have been driven by policy changes encouraging the production of biofuels and supply-side developments as well.\n\nThe thirst of the emerging-market economies for raw materials and the relative inefficiency with which they use these raw materials has propelled industrial commodity prices to record levels. The fact that these increases have been persistent and not quickly reversed has raised tough questions about traditional measures of core inflation and made it increasingly difficult for central bankers to separate signal from noise in the inflation data. We in Dallas look at not just the traditional measure of core inflation that simply excludes food and energy prices, but also a trimmed mean measure that we think gives a better sense of where trends may be headed. While an improvement on the traditional measure, it too has some shortcomings, and I believe that over the long term, the price stability that matters most to the people who pay our salaries, since they do eat and they do drive, is stability of a comprehensive measure of prices.\n\nGlobalization of labor markets also matters for inflation dynamics. Now, one of the key differences between the current era of globalization and the one that preceded WWI has to do with the greater restrictions on international movement of labor. We don’t see the same mass movements of people as characterized the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, and with more countries providing social safety nets, and the equivalent of “virtual immigration” through cyberspace, we are unlikely to see such mass migrations ever again. Nevertheless, for some countries, recent movements of workers have been quantitatively large enough to affect prices. The recent expansion of the European Union and the freeing of labor mobility has clearly made a difference to wage and price dynamics in Europe. Whether this is a one-off effect associated with a permanent reallocation of labor from low-wage to high-wage countries or a longer-term development whereby workers are more willing to move in search of job opportunities in response to the business cycle, it is too early to say.\n\nThe third key dimension of globalization—that of capital markets—also matters for inflation, but in a way that fundamentally differs from trade flows and migration. Greater international capital mobility seems to have a disciplining effect on policymakers worldwide by making it costly to engage in reckless fiscal or monetary policies. But again, I think there is two-way causation. Sounder monetary policy in more countries has contributed to the willingness of investors to venture abroad, but the ease with which capital can take flight has also made it more costly for central banks to deviate from the new orthodoxy of price stability.\n\nThe fourth dimension is the least understood. That is the global assignment of tasks through nontraditional channels. The U.S. is a high-value-added, services-driven economy; services represent over 80 percent of our economy. The growth of service sector trade, particularly through fiber optic cable and satellite connections, poses significant measurement issues. It is not as if we can just go down to the docks and count containers coming and going to quantify the impact of service sector trade. And what implication does the increasing trade in tasks with cheap labor pools around the globe pose for pricing of services and, in turn, for inflation?\n\nKen’s final point has to do with the skepticism of some academics about the implications of globalization for monetary policy. He cites a recent important paper by Michael Woodford as a representative example, so let me conclude with two observations related to that paper. First, I think there is an element of talking at cross purposes in some of the exchanges that have taken place on what globalization may or may not mean for monetary policy. I am in substantive agreement with Woodford that globalization does not undermine the ability of the Fed, or any other central bank for that matter, to control inflation over an appropriate time horizon, but it does challenge us—you might say it disciplines us—to conduct monetary policy more prudently. In today’s world, where investors can move their funds instantly from one currency to another to avoid depreciation, the price central bankers pay for high inflation is much higher than in the past. Understanding this, you can see why I am a steadfast inflation-fighting owl.\n\nGlobalization also should make us change the way we interpret some of the indicators that have traditionally played such an important role in monetary policy deliberations. Globalization indeed warrants the examination of a broader array of data in arriving at monetary policy decisions. For example, understanding global capacity utilization in an industry may be more useful than equivalent measures of domestic capacity. Second, the elegance of Woodford’s exposition notwithstanding, we are still some way from having a consensus model of how the domestic and international economy works. Enormous progress has been made in recent decades, due in no small part to the work of scholars like Ken Rogoff and Michael Woodford, but a lot more remains to be done, and we are spending an enormous amount of time doing it at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. At times of rapid structural change, it is important to keep an open mind and challenge old assumptions and paradigms, within a framework of disciplined, evidence-based scientific inquiry.",

            "content": "March 4, 2008 London, England\n\nIt is an honor to speak here in London to the Society of Business Economists at the suggestion of my much-admired friend, Charlie Bean at the Bank of England. Charlie is on the advisory board of the Dallas Fed’s Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute, and we are most grateful for his insight and, not unimportantly, his wit.\n\nI am on my way to a conference in Paris, where I have been invited by the Banque de France to comment on a paper by another of our institute’s esteemed advisors, Harvard professor Ken Rogoff. I hope my French hosts will forgive me for bringing up my favorite of all of Shakespeare’s histories this evening, Henry V, as I recall one of the more pleasant moments during my tenure on the Federal Open Market Committee. During our last meeting with Alan Greenspan as chairman, some of us took advantage of the moment to ham it up and work a farewell salute into our otherwise somber interventions. I chose to adapt Henry’s speech to the troops at Agincourt. Affecting my best Kenneth Branagh imitation, I mangled the words of the Bard: “We few, we happy few, we band of bankers,” and so on, concluding with the observation that “…other economists now abed”—it was morning when we met—“shall think themselves accursed they were not here, and hold their policy prescriptions cheap while any speaks that served in Alan Greenspan’s days.” When I finished, Alan looked down the table and said, “President Fisher, was that Henry V?” “Yes, Mr. Chairman,” I replied. “I know I’ve reached retirement age,” said the ancient chairman. “I went to high school with that guy.”\n\nWould that we could today enjoy such levity from the days when SIVs, CDOs, ARS and SLARS and VRDOs—or the “R” or the “S” words, as in “recession” and “stagflation”—were not yet part of the polite lexicon of monetary circles. These are not the happiest of times. These are, to put it euphemistically, challenging times for central bankers. We are confronted with the twin evils of slower growth and higher inflation, while also having to fight a banging hangover that resulted from allowing financial intermediaries to party on too hard for too long.\n\nThe monetary policy and regulatory frameworks that appeared to serve us so well in past decades are being stress-tested in ways that few dared imagine during that bucolic period when many were lulled into assuming things would be forever NICE, as Mervyn King so memorably put it.[1] We know now that a Non-Inflationary Consistent Expansion is not the steady state of nature. Neither is the Great Moderation of both the economy and financial market volatility.\n\nIndeed, as I speak, central bankers here and across both the pond and the channel feel besieged by a seemingly insurmountable foe delivering retribution for our having been complacent, if not smug, during those happier days. Like Henry’s troops at Agincourt, it may appear that we face overwhelming odds. Yet I am not overwhelmed.\n\nWhy not, you ask? Allow me to invoke another of your English ancestors in reply. Winston Churchill once asked: “Why is it that the ship beats the waves, when they are so many and the ship is one? The reason is that the ship has a purpose.” Tonight, I wish to give my view of the purpose of the Federal Reserve.\n\nNeedless to say—but I will say so anyway—the views I express this evening will be my own and not those of any other member of the Federal Open Market Committee or any official of the Federal Reserve System. This is but one man’s soliloquy.\n\nThe Federal Reserve, unlike the Bank of England, has a dual mandate. We are charged with creating the monetary conditions to support sustainable noninflationary employment growth. We must keep our eyes on two things: economic growth and price pressures. Of course, this is easier said than done. It poses a conundrum of priority and balance. How should we weigh the risks of slow growth over the need to manage inflation? Reasonable men and women can agree that inflation is a sinister beast that, if untethered, will devour savings, erode the purchasing power of consumers, decimate returns on capital, undermine the reliability of financial accounting, distract the attention of corporate management and undercut employment growth and real wages. Thoughtful men and women can also agree that at certain junctures, sluggish employment growth and financial instability present greater risks than inflation to the economic welfare of the nation. Both feverish price pressures and economic anemia matter, and both present great risk to our welfare. Both deserve our attention. But the question of the day is which deserves more of our attention right now.\n\nSome argue it is the slowing economy. Even if you foresee the most likely U.S. scenario as a period of flat growth for a few quarters, followed later in the year by a return to potential growth of about 3 percent, one cannot help but worry about whether the so-called tail risk—the odds of the worst-case scenario on the growth distribution curve unfolding—is getting fatter as the inventory of unsold homes continues to swell, consumers’ sense of wealth and businesses’ confidence erodes, and the solicitous bankers that used to court them become more coy.\n\nYet, the worst-case scenario remains very much a “tail” risk. As Chairman Bernanke noted in testimony before Congress last week, the nonfinancial sector has held up reasonably well and continues to expand. Employment growth is weakening and consumer confidence is sagging, but inventories and other indicators remain constructive. You can see evidence of this in the fourth quarter’s corporate performance. Thomson Financial reported last week that earnings were on track to be down 22 percent for the 462 S&P 500 companies that have so far released their numbers for the quarter. But strip out the financial institutions, and earnings were up 12 percent, and 62 percent of those 462 companies reported earnings that topped analysts’ expectations. In all, that is not bad when you consider the beating the financials have taken and how stocks of housing and housing-related companies have been pummeled.\n\nThe woes of financial operators should not be overlooked, of course. There is a palpable risk that their pathology will lead to credit constriction that will, in turn, trigger an economic contraction. But thus far, the Cassandras on Wall Street, in the press and on the political campaign trails have had less to be glum about than they expected—or perhaps they had hoped for.\n\nThis is not to say that we are not at risk of encountering turbulence. Personally, I think the cruising speed of the U.S. economy has slowed considerably, and it is likely to remain subpar for the current and following quarter. Without getting into specific numbers, I will tell you that my growth forecast is one of the more bearish among FOMC members. For someone like me, who has served on corporate boards and run a private company, it is not difficult to imagine managers being cautioned by their directors and consultants to batten down their hatches and run ever tighter ships at a time of gloomy news stories, dire predictions by respectable analysts and alarming rhetoric from public officials. While there is a risk the U.S. economy might sputter, I do not believe that mighty engine will stall. I have tremendous faith in the ability of the women and men who operate the private sector to overcome obstacles placed before them and keep the pistons of the economy pumping. You can lose a lot of money betting against the recuperative power of the American economy.\n\nAt the same time, I am fully aware that the FOMC must be careful to not undermine that recuperative process. Here, of course, I refer to the potential harm to the consumer and the business and financial sectors alike by unwittingly allowing the perception to take hold that, as the New York Times editorialized in its lead front page article last Thursday, “the Federal Reserve, signaled [its] readiness … to bolster the economy with cheaper money even though inflation is picking up speed.”[2]\n\nTalk of “cheap money” makes my skin crawl. The words imply a debased currency and inflation and the harsh medicine that inevitably must be administered to purge it. So you should not be surprised that I consider the perception that the Fed is pursuing a cheap-money strategy, should it take root, to be a paramount risk to the long-term welfare of the U.S. economy.\n\nI believe the Times overstates its case. Chairman Bernanke made clear in his congressional testimony last week that we are monitoring inflationary pressures and expectations closely. And yet, I understand the source of the Times’ sentiment. In a globalized capital market where money is free to move anywhere it pleases, there is scant tolerance for even the slightest whiff of inflation. Since the January FOMC meeting, longer-term rates, including those on fixed mortgages, have risen rather than followed the federal funds rate downward. Over the same period, the dollar has declined nearly 3 percent against the euro. We know that monetary policy acts with a lag, but even with my well-documented pessimism about the efficacy of lowering the fed funds rate to 3 percent, I had privately hoped, against the odds, that we might get a psychological pop out of the yield curve. Instead, we have heard more and more reports of inflationary concerns, and with them increases in longer-term rates and record low exchange rates for the dollar.\n\nMind you, all these signals could be aberrations—twitches in markets that have occasionally led me to wonder if they were afflicted with the financial equivalent of Tourette’s syndrome. But they might also indicate that the markets are unnerved by the idea of further monetary accommodation in a world where commodity prices inch upward almost on a daily basis and labor costs escalate in Chinese factories, among Indian programmers and all along global supply chains.\n\nI am going to dwell on inflation for a few minutes because I consider it a critical issue. I spoke earlier of Churchill’s ship of purpose. As my FOMC colleague Governor Rick Mishkin argues so eloquently, it is essential that monetary policy firmly anchor inflation expectations. If the Federal Reserve has an overarching purpose, in my opinion, it is to make sure that anchor stays firmly in place.\n\nRecent readings on inflation have not been encouraging. The rate of increase in the core personal consumption expenditures price index, or core PCE—that is, what people buy, except food and energy—was 2.2 percent over the 12 months ending in January. Yet, its headline counterpart, which includes food and energy, increased an alarming 3.7 percent over the same time frame. Both core and headline PCE figures have been following an accelerating trajectory over the past several months. If you annualize the change in the PCE over the most recent three-month period, for example, you’ll notice that the core rose 3 percent, while headline rose 5.4 percent.\n\nClearly, food and energy prices matter, as these differences make clear. The price index for food rose 4.7 percent over the past 12 months, a rate not seen since 1990. Through January, the PCE energy component was up roughly 23 percent over 12 months.\n\nWhile some of the movement in core consumer price inflation represents pass-through of high energy prices—to transportation services, for example—we have also seen pickups in other components, such as recreation, education and personal care services, and upticks in components, such as apparel, that have historically exerted downward pressure on the price of the consumer’s basket of goods.\n\nThere was a time, back when I was an outside observer of the Federal Reserve, when the Fed practiced what some have dubbed “opportunistic disinflation.” Beginning in the mid-1980s, the FOMC recognized that while recessions sometimes occur, they could not be anticipated with any precision and that by the time the data revealed a recession, it was too late to do much about it, given the impact lags of monetary policy. The FOMC also recognized that the trend rate of inflation generally fell by about a percentage point or more following a recession. Put it all together and you get opportunistic disinflation, or the idea that if recession comes, make the best of it by bringing down the inflation rate.\n\nThis was a period of persistent disinflation—and, I might add, a period during which the U.S. economy experienced only two short and mild recessions, a total of 16 months over almost 25 years. Over this same period, the inflation rate declined inexorably, reaching a point where the FOMC had to deal with the threat of deflation in 2003–04. It was also the period when the Fed made the largest gains in its policy credibility.\n\nOne would like to think that as the economy slows, inflationary pressures will do likewise. But we cannot always be sure they will, given the globalized nature of the U.S. economy. Demand-pull pressures abroad have an increasingly potent influence on our domestic economy. Traditionally, a central bank would expect slack to develop as the economy under its jurisdiction weakened, leading to less demand for most inputs and an easing of price pressures. We no longer operate in a traditional economy. Domestic inflation developments have become increasingly less sensitive to domestic measures of slack. In an open, globalized economy, capacity utilization and inflation pressures need to be measured, or at a minimum, understood in their global context.\n\nYou cannot think in a purely domestic context about the pricing of oil or steel or soybeans or pulp or shoes or clothing or even what I consider to be one of life’s essentials, beer, because innovations in transportation and communications technology have all but eliminated national borders for almost any product for which trade barriers were negotiated away during the 1980s and ’90s. More vexing for economists and econometric modelers, the information technology revolution and the spread of the Internet have blurred the once-clear distinction between easy-to-trade goods and difficult-to-trade services. As a result, trade in services is one of the most rapidly growing components of global trade. Thus, even the available supply of architects or petroleum engineers or software designers or medical technicians or lawyers must increasingly be considered in the context of global rather than domestic demand.\n\nThe point is that, at present, we simply do not have the ability to adequately account for the impact globalization has on the gearing of our domestic economy. Absent that capacity, we cannot, in my opinion, confidently assume that slower U.S. economic growth will quell U.S. inflation and, more important, keep inflationary expectations anchored. Containing inflation is the purpose of the ship I crew for, and if a temporary economic slowdown is what we must endure while we achieve that purpose, then it is, in my opinion, a burden we must bear, however politically inconvenient.\n\nTo some, this may appear a Hobson’s choice. I don’t see it that way. Our obligation is to prevent inflation in order to sustain long-term employment growth. I believe that the best way to cut through the treacherous economic waves that are upon us and keep our ship steaming forward is to stick to our purpose.\n\nThat about says it all for tonight. Let me bring this back to London. Recently, the New York Times ran a delightful article on your search for a motto that captures the essence of Britain. My favorite was Nemo me impune lacessit, which loosely translated—according to my Texas Latin—means “Never sit on a thistle.” Tonight I may have taken the risk of sitting on the thistle of opprobrium of those of you who wished to hear a more felicitous speech. But Charlie Bean’s advice was to “just tell ’em what you think.” That is what I have done, and I thank you for allowing me to do so.\n\nIn the time that remains this evening, I would be happy to take questions and, in true central banking fashion, do my level best to avoid answering them.",

            "content": "February 7, 2008 Mexico City, Mexico\n\nThank you for allowing me to speak here today. This is something of a homecoming for me. I grew up in Mexico City, and though you will find it hard to imagine from my rudimentary Spanish, I attended elementary school here, studying English as a second language. I have a deep affection for Mexico and all things Mexican. I learned about Hidalgo and Benito Juarez before I learned about George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. I was taught about the Mayan, Toltec and Aztec cultures before I was taught about the ancient histories of the Greeks and Romans in American schools. I cherish the memory of my childhood here and carry Mexico in my heart. It is a great honor for me to speak at this fine academy today, to the best and brightest young minds of this magnificent country.\n\nThis afternoon, I am going to lecture on the importance of having an independent central bank. I will argue that an independent central bank is a logical and vital feature of a well-functioning economy; that it protects a democratic government from its own worst instincts; that one of the great achievements of recent Mexican history was the 1994 constitutional amendment that granted Banco de México true independence. Further, I will assert that the leadership of Banco de México under Governor Ortiz has been superb, because he is taking me to dinner this week and I want to make sure we have a good time!\n \nAt the end of this lecture I am going to address recent events, including last week’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, because doing so will illustrate, in real time, the challenges faced by central bankers at interesting junctures of economic history.\n\nThis afternoon, as always, I speak in my own capacity as president of one of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks and as only one voice among the 17 that currently participate in the deliberations of the Federal Open Market Committee.[1] I do not speak on behalf of any other Federal Reserve official or on behalf of the committee.\n \nIt is my understanding that all of you are bilingual, so I will cease torturing you with my poor Spanish and proceed from here in English. Later, we will have a question-and-answer session that we can do in either language, or perhaps even in the tongue of my beloved Texas: Spanglish.\n\nLet me start with a refresher course on economics, so that we are all on the same page.\n\nThe price of a good or service is determined by supply and demand. Too much demand relative to supply leads to an increase in the relative price of that good or service. Too little leads to a price decrease. Money and credit are the means by which aggregate demand is managed in the economy. The central banker’s task is to provide the monetary and credit conditions that achieve the ideal balance between accommodating economic expansion and engendering inflation or deflation.\n\nThe ultimate task assigned to central banks is to maximize the welfare of the people by providing the monetary conditions for sustainable, noninflationary economic growth. In the long run, growth cannot be sustained if markets are undermined by inflation or deflation. The idea that stable prices go hand in hand with achieving sustainable economic growth has led more and more central banks around the world to adopt price stability as their exclusive mandate. Mexico took that view one step further by explicitly writing price stability into the constitutional amendment that granted Banco de México its independence.\n\nI submit that the likelihood of achieving sustainable economic growth and keeping inflation at bay is best enhanced by having central banks that operate with independence from government meddling.\n\nEconomic theory generally embraces the idea that a nation’s money supply ought not be directly controlled by its government because such an arrangement would create a perverse incentive structure that would lead to economic disaster. Printing money, or debasing the currency, to pay off government debt is an old concept, noticed by the ancient Greeks and famously practiced by the Romans. In 1824, David Ricardo warned that a government entrusted with the power to issue money would most certainly abuse it.[2] Like all good economists, Ricardo knew the destructive dynamic of printing excess money: The result is inflation, the cruelest form of taxation—especially for the poor and for savers—and the greatest obstacle for entrepreneurs and financiers seeking to invest and grow their businesses.\n\nWe have some glaring examples today of the destruction that can be wrought by governments with direct control over monetary policy. Zimbabwe is the most egregious. A year ago, after having let monetary printing presses run wild to cover up problems created by misgovernment, President Mugabe famously declared inflation illegal, promising to arrest and punish anyone who raised prices or wages. Of course, that didn’t work. Just last week it was announced that Zimbabwe’s inflation reached 26,470 percent in November. The economy of Zimbabwe has been destroyed and its people cast further into poverty as their savings disappear.\n\nThere are some instructive examples of poor monetary governance in our own hemisphere. In the interest of time, I’ll point to just one case: Venezuela.\n\nOne would think that Venezuela would be enjoying the prosperity that comes from oil priced above $80 a barrel. But Venezuela’s government has taken effective control of the central bank and printed trillions of bolivars to finance ambitious social programs. The result has been an official inflation rate of 22.7 percent. However, the official figure includes a broad basket of items for which the government has declared price controls, so it is more likely that the real purchasing power of the bolivar is being cut in half or more each year. The Venezuelan consumer has been decimated.\n\nTo counter the inflation the government itself has created, Venezuela recently introduced a new currency, the “bolivar fuerte,” which is basically the old bolivar with three zeros trimmed off. Some of your economics professors are old enough to remember when Mexico trimmed zeros off the peso during a time of high inflation. I am sure they will agree that getting rid of all those zeros made it easier to do everyday transactions, but the idea that inflation can be brought under control simply by dividing all prices and the currency by 1,000 is like believing you can keep a room’s temperature constant by dividing the thermometer marker by two every time the heat index doubles. Marketing gimmicks with new paper money do not lower the heat of inflation; they do not make prices stable. The problem is a lack of economic discipline and bad government policies that have undermined sustainable economic growth and destroyed Venezuela’s prosperity.\n\nI think you get the picture. Why do we have independent central banks? To provide a barrier between government and the money supply. Why is this necessary? Because doing the right thing for the long-term interests of the people can be very hard to do. Monetary policymakers often have to make decisions that can cause economic pain for real people in the short term, or decide not to do things that could help people out of an immediate bad situation, in order to preserve the welfare of the people over the long run.\n\nThe incentives given to elected officials, even in the most praiseworthy democracies, increase the likelihood of harnessing monetary policy to their political needs. A congressman or a senator or a president who has all the best intentions and works earnestly for long-term prosperity is still subject to reelection and would quickly find himself voted out of a job if he tried to implement some of the stern policies that an independent central banker is often required to carry through.\n\nIt is always easier, for example, to float a weakening economy by loosening the moorings of monetary policy rather than cutting taxes or increasing spending. It is easier to allow inflation to finance ambitious social programs or bail out a government from the burden of debt. Forgive me for invoking Greek mythology and the work of Homer, but governments often fall victim to the Siren call of monetary accommodation. But with an independent central bank, a government, like Odysseus, can tie itself to the mast and commit to the best policy course for the long haul. Aware of the perilous fate that awaits those who succumb to the Sirens, a wise government can direct its central bankers to stuff beeswax in their ears and ignore the seductive calls of powerful interests that demand accommodation to satisfy immediate political needs. Undistracted by political motivation, the central bank can focus exclusively on piloting economic policy on a consistent course toward sustainable, noninflationary growth.\n\nAn independent central bank thus occupies a unique place in the pantheon of government institutions. Properly designed, it will pursue a deliberate and steady course, untainted by the passion of the moment and immune to political exigency and influence. Governments bestow independence upon their central banks once they realize that the best approach to monetary policymaking is a clearly defined mandate for price stability and noninflationary economic growth, applied consistently from administration to administration, year to year, decade to decade, generation to generation.\n\nTo understand the rewards that come from having an independent central bank able to block out the Siren calls and focus on price stability, the world need only look here to Mexico. Mexico can boast today of an inflation rate that by some measures is even lower than that of the U.S. Mexico has managed two presidential transitions without a peso crisis. Mexican financial markets now have the credibility to issue debt in pesos up to 30 years at less than 8 percent, whereas only a decade ago the longest maturity horizon for Mexican government debt was one year at over 20 percent. The yield curve for Mexico has been extended, and Mexican businesses and consumers can now borrow in pesos longer term, enabling the development of crucial infrastructure, such as housing stock. Foreigners can now invest in Mexico without fear of significant peso devaluations.\n\nThis is not the Mexico I grew up in. Today, the Mexican people have greater wherewithal to realize their dreams. Mexican leaders have earned some impressive bragging rights: Two weeks ago in Davos, as the various leaders assembled there were bemoaning the financial crisis presently afflicting global credit markets, Governor Ortiz, looking back to the Tequila Crisis and other episodes, exclaimed that “this time, it wasn’t us.”\n\nMexico would not be in this proud position today had your government not amended the constitution in 1994 to create a fully independent central bank with price stability as its main goal. Banco de México has become a no-nonsense practitioner of inflation targeting, rightfully earning the respect of the international investment and monetary policy communities. And here comes the flattering part that I hope will earn me a nice dinner with Governor Ortiz: It is widely accepted in central banking circles that under his direction, Banco de México has become one of the most highly regarded central banks in the world.\n\nIt requires more than just a law bestowing independence upon a central bank for the bank to actually be independent. It also requires that it be independent in practice. By definition, for a central bank to be independent, it must possess the ability to define its policy objectives without political pressure and it must be free to use its policy instruments without constraints. This is easier said than done.\n\nWe know from our own experience at the Federal Reserve that in times of duress, Congress or the executive branch can interfere with the workings of a central bank with disastrous consequences. In the 1960s, a populist congressman from East Texas named Wright Patman, who was chairman of the House Banking Committee, launched a comprehensive review of the Federal Reserve System that exacted an enormous strain on the System’s staff and resources. Congressman Patman was convinced that, contrary to David Ricardo, “money need[ed] to be back in politics where it was in the 19th century.”[3] He wanted to legislate away the Fed’s independence and turn it into an arm of the executive branch. Patman’s investigation had reached a point where the 12 Federal Reserve regional banks and the Washington-based Board of Governors could no longer focus on economic analysis or other functions. Complying with Patman’s congressional subpoenas was keeping the Fed from doing its job.\n\nAt the same time, President Lyndon Johnson was escalating the U.S. military presence in Vietnam and spending a pretty penny to do so; federal defense expenditures rose to over 10 percent of GDP, more than double the burden of U.S. military spending today. Johnson needed to finance that spending and felt that the Federal Reserve could provide funds cheaply by keeping interest rates low. The Federal Reserve had a real dilemma. It could cut a deal with President Johnson, who, as the most powerful Texan, could call Patman off, but at the price of surrendering Fed policy independence to Johnson’s desires; or it could continue to endure the Patman investigation and risk the Fed’s charter and long-run institutional independence.\n\nI should note that whether the then-chairman of the Fed, a very talented and honorable man named William McChesney Martin, and Johnson made a deal is a matter of speculation. Such an agreement would not have been documented if it did exist. What is known is that Chairman Martin met with Johnson at the White House in May 1964, and soon thereafter the Patman hearings unceremoniously ended without any legislation amending the Federal Reserve’s standing. The Fed held interest rates mostly unchanged over the next 19 months—until December 1965—despite mounting inflation fueled by government spending.\n\nU.S. government budget deficits continued to grow, reaching their highest relative levels on record in the 1970s. Sadly, the Fed monetized these deficits for several years during the 1960s under Martin’s chairmanship and in the 1970s under his successors, Chairmen Arthur Burns and William Miller. By 1979, inflation had jumped to 14 percent and the prime rate reached 20 percent.\n\nThe Federal Reserve managed to regain control of the economy and its own independence under the firm leadership of Paul Volcker. But the cure for high inflation was a dose of harsh medicine. A severe recession ensued, followed by years of high unemployment and high interest rates. Monetary decisions made for short-term political gain exacted a heavy toll on the American people.\n\nThe Siren call for monetary accommodation to address political ends is universal and can seduce any leader. Whether you live in Zimbabwe, Venezuela, Mexico, the United States or anywhere else, maintaining true central bank independence is required for achieving long-term economic prosperity. The Federal Reserve and Banco de México can best preserve our charters and the sacred trust of the people by doing what we have been assigned to do: remain focused on making monetary policy that achieves long-term sustainable noninflationary growth. The future prosperity of our two countries depends upon it.\n\nWhich brings us to the present situation.\n\nUnder Chairmen Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve has been left alone to conduct monetary policy. We are a truly independent central bank. Policy is set by the Federal Open Market Committee. The 17 current participants in the FOMC deliberations consist of five governors, including the chairman, who are appointed by the president of the United States and confirmed by the Senate, and 12 presidents of the Fed’s regional Banks, each of whom serves at the pleasure of his or her Bank’s board of directors. All 17 participate in honest and vigorous discussion of the economy and each offers his or her individual policy prescription at FOMC meetings convened and presided over by the chairman. At the end of these meetings, the chairman calls for a vote. All the governors vote every year and five of the presidents vote under a rotation system so that different presidents vote year by year. This year, I have the privilege of being one of the five voting presidents.\n\nAt the last meeting of the FOMC, I voted against lowering the federal funds rate—the target rate we set for banks to loan overnight money to each other—from 3.5 percent to 3 percent. The minutes of that meeting will be released on Feb. 20, 2008. It would be inappropriate for me to discuss the deliberations; however, I can give you a perspective.\n\nI spoke earlier of William McChesney Martin. He famously said that the job of a good central banker is to take away the punchbowl just as the party gets going. For the past few years, we have had a raucous party of economic growth fueled by an intoxicating brew of credit market practices that financed a housing boom of historic, and late in the cycle, hysteric, proportions. With the benefit of perfect hindsight, some have argued that the Fed failed to take away the punchbowl as the subprime party spun out of control, leaving rates too low for too long and not using our regulatory powers to restrain excessive complacency in the pricing and monitoring of risk. But that is beside the point.\n\nNow we are faced with the consequences of a process that lawyers would call the “discovery phase”: As big banks and other financial agents confess their acts of fiduciary omission and excesses of commission, credit markets have effectively de-leveraged important segments of the economy, slowing growth suddenly and precipitously. Instead of taking the punchbowl away, the Federal Reserve is now faced with the task of replenishing the punch.\n\nYet at the same time, we are faced with the unprecedented consequence of demand-pull inflationary forces fueled by the voracious consumption of oil, wheat, corn, iron ore, steel and copper, and all other kinds of commodities and inputs, including labor, among the 3 billion new participants in the global economy. When it comes to these precious inputs, we have no control over the surging demand from China, India, Brazil, the countries of the former Soviet Union and other new growth centers, but we know that it is putting upward pressure on prices in our economy. Economists note that the “income elasticity of demand” for food is higher in China and other emerging economies than in the United States. Many of these countries’ income elasticity of demand for oil and certain other vital commodities is greater than 1, meaning that their demand for these items will increase faster than their income. Even if growth slows somewhat in some of these important emerging economies—the World Bank, for example, projects China’s growth will be 9.6 percent in 2008, down from 11 percent last year—demand for inputs relative to the world’s ability to supply them will likely continue to exert upward pressure on key commodity prices.\n\nWe also know that the inflationary expectations of consumers and business leaders are impacted by what they pay for gasoline at the pump and food at the grocery store.\n\nMonetary policy acts with a lag. I liken it to a good single malt whiskey or perhaps truly great tequila: It takes time before you feel its full effect. The Fed has to be very careful now to add just the right amount of stimulus to the punchbowl without mixing in the potential to juice up inflation once the effect of the new punch kicks in.\n\nWe have been hard at work trying to find the right mixture. Before the meeting last week, we had reduced the fed funds rate by 175 basis points in 18 weeks—cuts that I supported even though I did not have a formal vote. During that time, we also initiated a new system for term money that has auctioned $100 billion at rates below the official discount rate.\n\nMy dissenting vote last week was simply a difference of opinion about how far and how fast we might re-spike the monetary punchbowl. Given that I had yet to see a mitigation in inflation and inflationary expectations from their current high levels, and that I believed the steps we had already taken would be helpful in mitigating the downside risk to growth once they took full effect, I simply did not feel it was the proper time to support additional monetary accommodation.\n\nI respect the majority view of the committee. I sleep well at night knowing that the collective wisdom of the group is guided by one common goal: the continued prosperity of the American people.\n\nWell, my friends, such is the life of a central banker. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak with you. It’s been a great pleasure. I hope you now have a better understanding of the importance of an independent central bank. You can leave here proud of the role that Banco de México has played in the economic development of this great country. As for me, after answering your questions, I’m going to stuff beeswax back in my ears, tie myself to the mast and hope that the distinguished Governor Ortiz will offer me a copious drink from his personal punchbowl. Thank you for listening.",

            "content": "January 17, 2008 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nThank you, Charlie [Plosser]. I am grateful for the invitation to speak to the Global Interdependence Center.\n\nI am going to take advantage of this podium to provide the Dallas Fed’s point of view, from a global perspective, on the issue that preoccupies President Plosser and me and our colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee. That issue is the conduct of monetary policy given our current economic predicament. If you will indulge me, we can address other issues of global interdependence in the Q&A session. Before I get started, let me go on record as having said that, as always, I speak today only for myself and not for the Federal Open Market Committee, its members or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nFirst, a word about Philadelphia. I spent a tad more than my Fed per diem last night and stayed at the Ritz Carlton at Broad and Chestnut. Before it became a hotel, that monumental building housed the old Girard Trust Company. True Philadelphians know the rock-solid financial legacy of Stephen Girard. In 1811, he bought the remaining shares in the First Bank of the United States and renamed it Girard’s Bank. History footnotes Girard’s Bank as the key financial backer of the U.S. during the War of 1812. According to one estimate, the value of Girard's net worth at his death in 1831 was roughly $2 trillion in today’s dollars. Imagine: Girard made Warren Buffett look like a piker! He and his bank were so financially solid that the saying “In Girard we trust” was later morphed into the Girard Trust Company.\n\nIt was Girard Trust that took an interest in me in 1963 and gave my family the means to send me far from home to a New Jersey boarding school. I never quite learned why they treated me so kindly, but I do remember my father saying that Girard had a soft spot for wayward boys from “challenged” backgrounds who might—just might—have some potential for salvation. I would never have accumulated all those honors mentioned in President Plosser’s introduction, nor would I have had the good life I have enjoyed, nor would I be addressing you today as a Federal Reserve Bank president, had it not been for Girard Trust.\n\nSo I slept well last night in the bosom of that solid old building that was once a pillar of financial rectitude—a rare luxury for a policymaker in these fitful times.\n\nYou’d be hard pressed to find an economist or market operator in this city or anywhere else on the planet who is not concerned about waning U.S. economic growth. Some analysts and commentators sound like Chicken Littles. Others are less excitable, but are nevertheless assuming a defensive crouch. Most are mindful of recent developments in employment patterns, uneven retail sales and downward shifts in shipping, rail and trucking indexes, industrial activity, business capex plans, credit card payables, purchasing manager activity and other carefully watched indicators. These stresses follow on the severe housing downturn and the liquidity bind. There is an increasingly insistent drumbeat urging the Fed not only to not impose contractionary policy on a weakening economy, but indeed to get “ahead of the curve” through further monetary accommodation.\n\nChairman Bernanke spoke last week and made it clear that the FOMC stands “ready to take substantive action needed to support growth and provide insurance against downside risks,” adding that “additional policy easing may well be necessary.” In short, he made clear that the FOMC does not intend to just squat and wait should economic data and sound risk management signal that monetary accommodation is required.\n\nIt needs to be underscored that being proactive and not passive in doing our job does not mean that we will abandon prudent decisionmaking. We are the central bank of the United States, the bellwether economy of the world. Our job is not to bail out imprudent decisionmakers or errant bankers, nor is it to directly support the stock market or to somehow make whole those money managers, financial engineers and real estate speculators who got it wrong. And it most definitely is not to err on the side of Wall Street at the expense of Main Street.\n\nIn fact, to benefit Main Street, we have a duty to maintain a financial system that enables American capitalism to do its magic. To this end, we have recently taken steps designed to circumvent bottlenecks in interbank lending—steps that include changing the operation of our discount window and opening a new term auction facility. This facility has provided $70 billion in funds in roughly a month and will soon provide another $30 billion, and perhaps even more over time if needed.\n\nIn setting broader monetary policy and the fed funds target rate, the Fed operates under a dual mandate. We are charged by Congress with creating the monetary conditions for sustainable, noninflationary employment growth. Put more simply, our mandate is to grow employment and to contain inflation. Unstable prices are incompatible with sustainable job growth. Some critics worry that we have forgotten that axiom. We haven’t.\n\nLet me give you my personal view.\n\nIn discharging our dual mandate, we must be mindful that short-term fixes often lead to long-term problems. The Fed occupies a unique place in the pantheon of government institutions. It was deliberately designed to be calm and steady, untainted by the passion of the moment and immune to political exigency and influence. Because monetary policy’s effects spread into the economy slowly and accumulate over time, having an itchy trigger finger with monetary policy risks shooting everyone in the foot. Our policy mandate must be discharged with careful and deliberate aim.\n\nIn the attention-deficit world of television and Internet commentary, where so-called “instant analysis”—an oxymoron if there ever was one—makes headlines, it is easy to understand why one might think that the effect of a change in the fed funds rate would immediately alter the dynamic of the economy. To be sure, movement in the fed funds rate, or even no movement at all, may have an immediate psychological effect and influence expectations for future monetary policy action. But the act of changing or not changing the fed funds target rate, in and of itself, has no immediate effect on the economy. Like a good single malt whiskey, the ameliorating or stimulating influence kicks in only with a lag.\n\nThe lag time necessary for inflation to respond to policy is especially long. As a policymaker discharging our dual mandate, I am always mindful that in providing the monetary conditions for employment growth, we must not also sow the seeds of inflation that will eventually choke off the very employment growth we seek to encourage. You do not have to be an inflation “hawk” to recognize that would be a Faustian bargain.\n\nThose of you who follow my speeches—probably a very small number of you with way too much time on your hands—will recall that I like neither the term “hawk” nor “dove.” I like to think that all FOMC members are best metaphorically described in ornithological terms as “owls”—wise women and men seeking to achieve the right balance in carrying out our dual mandate. To be owlish, and to avoid the imbalance of emphasis that gave rise to needed harsh discipline imposed by the Volcker FOMC, one has to bear in mind that the seeds of inflation, once planted, can lie fallow for some time, then suddenly burst through the economic topsoil like kudzu, requiring a near-toxic dose of countermeasures to overcome.\n\nIn the pre-Volcker era, the Fed had a less-than-admirable record of keeping inflation at bay. But over the past few decades, we have done well enough to both contain inflation and engender growth that far outpaced other advanced economies for a sustained period with only a smattering of short recessions. In short, the Fed has delivered on its mandate.\n\nTo be sure, we have been profoundly impacted by the shifting economic dynamics that have complicated our efforts to continue delivering on our mandate. I need not try to convince members and supporters of the Global Interdependence Center that we are living in a globalized world. Increasingly, globalization is blurring economic boundaries. On the inflation front, for example, we have extensive economic playbooks that tell us how to treat the wage–price spiral or cost-push forces in a closed economy. In a closed environment, one would ordinarily expect that a weakening economy would lead, in turn, to a diminution in price pressures. But we have less experience with prescribing policy in an open economy where demand-pull forces come from beyond our borders—such as the burgeoning demand for commodities and food from rapidly growing and newly consequential economies like China, India, Latin America and the countries liberated from the oppression of Soviet communism. These faraway places play an ever-increasing role in determining prices here at home.\n\nWriting in last Sunday’s New York Times, Ben Stein noted this and that the Fed does not have much power to influence the price of oil.[1] He is right. And for that matter, we can’t do much about the external demand impacting the price of food—which, by the way, carries twice the weight of energy in the consumer basket of personal consumption expenditures. But the dynamics of production and demand among the new participants in the global economy nonetheless impact us in different ways at different times. As these new participants joined the global economy, they provided significant tailwinds, helping us grow by providing cost savings, new sources of productivity enhancement and new sources of demand, helping fatten both the top line and bottom line of our businesses while also holding down inflation. Under such conditions, the Fed could operate with a more accommodative monetary policy than what might have been appropriate in a closed economy, without putting upward pressure on inflation. And that is what the Fed did, although some argue—with the benefit of hindsight—it did so for too long.\n\nI think it is now clear that the winds have shifted. The growing appetite for raw inputs from the new participants in the global economy represents an inflationary headwind that is unlikely to soon abate. The so-called “income elasticity of demand” for energy is 1.2 across a wide range of countries, which is a fancy way of saying that economic theory should lead one to conclude that the demand for energy in, say, China, for example, would begin to grow faster than China’s income growth, which continues to increase at a rapid rate. Put more simply, income growth in China and India and elsewhere, even if it slows from its torrid pace, is likely to continue raising demand for food and energy. There is a risk that upward price pressures will continue to affect American producers and consumers of energy and food products and a continuing danger that overall inflation expectations will drift upward as a result.\n\nIf I am correct, then the situation today is the flip side of the 1990s and early 2000s: In delivering on our mandate to be monetary policy “owls,” we will have to err on the side of running tighter policy than would otherwise be justified if we wish to limit upward inflation pressures.\n\nI mentioned single malt whiskey earlier to describe the effective time lags of monetary policy. I realize it is only lunchtime, but let’s return to the economics liquor cabinet for a moment. Inflation is like absinthe. The narcotic allure of inflation is a dangerous thing. It might seem like the remedy to bail out a government or a bad book of business and forget your troubles. Yet our experience in the past has taught us only too well that inflation is a dangerous elixir that ultimately proves debilitating for businesses, consumers, investors—including those foreign investors who have lately come to the aid of some large balance sheets here—and especially for the poor, the elderly and people on fixed incomes. It even inculcates bad financial behavioral patterns in the young by encouraging spending rather than investment and saving. Inflation is bad for Main Street and Wall Street and even for Sesame Street.\n\nYet we central bankers also traverse Lombard Street, and we know from Walter Bagehot that in times of crisis, liquidity is key. As a voter on the FOMC this year, I stand ready to take substantive action to support growth and provide insurance against downside risk, as long as inflation expectations remain contained.\n\nYou will note the operative qualifying words there were “as long as inflation expectations remain contained.” Each of us looks to different indicators for a sense of inflation’s direction. Some peruse markets for signs of shifting expectations, looking, say, to the yield on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, or to the spread between yields in the forward markets between TIPS and nominal Treasuries at different points of the yield curve or all along the entire curve. Personally, as a former market operator, I am wary of relying on Treasury spot or futures indicators during a flight to quality or at times when liquidity is at a premium, as investors may have other preoccupations that trump or distort conventional inflation concerns.\n\nOthers look to surveys of consumers and professional forecasters, like those conducted by the University of Michigan and the Philadelphia Fed. The latest, the University of Michigan survey, released in December, is forecasting headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation of 3.4 percent, which is hardly comforting. The Philadelphia Fed survey, released last November, provides a more palatable forecast of 2.4 percent for the next four quarters; yet if you plot that survey against actual headline inflation obtained for the last four years, it has more often than not underestimated inflation’s true path.\n\nThe brow of a central banker considering further accommodation furrows further when looking at the inflation measures that form the basis for Main Street’s inflationary expectations—the CPI and the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) deflator. On a 12-month basis, the most recent CPI, released yesterday, was running at a rate of 4.1 percent. The last PCE deflator, released in December, was 3.6 percent. The Trimmed Mean PCE Deflator, which the Dallas Fed tracks in an effort to eliminate “noise from signal” and as a basis for projecting inflation, is no longer trending downward. Even the so-called “Core PCE,” which I personally consider least useful because it eliminates food and energy prices, is rising rather than declining.\n\nOf course, what matters most is the future direction of inflation, not the past. In the course of preparing for each FOMC meeting, I regularly consult directly with some 30-plus CEOs to develop a sense of future business activity, including cost and pricing developments. I have found this rigorous exercise to be extremely helpful in placing our staff’s econometric analysis in context as I have prepared for FOMC meetings in the past, and I will be listening especially carefully to these business operators’ reports on inflation-related developments as I prepare for upcoming FOMC meetings.\n\nIn my view, the degree of substantive action to support economic growth and insure against downside risk will be conditioned by what we see coming down the inflation pike. To deliver on its dual mandate, the Fed must keep one ear cocked toward signs that inflationary expectations are drifting upward as we execute additional monetary measures.\n\nLet me bring this home to Philadelphia. In 1748, Benjamin Franklin wrote an “Advice to a Young Tradesman.” In it, he speaks in the language of the day of the concepts of opportunity cost and of the power of compound interest—pretty precocious stuff for those times. Of the money supply, he wrote that “the more there is of it, the more it produces [at] every turning, so that the profits rise quicker and quicker.” Yet he also warns in earthy terms of the dangers of being too prolific. “He that kills a breeding sow,” Franklin warned, “destroys all her offspring to the thousandth generation. He that murders a crown [the currency of the day], destroys all that it might have produced….”\n\nThe late Dame Mary Douglas was no Ben Franklin. Nor was she a Philadelphian. She was a brilliant British economic anthropologist who wrote a pathbreaking book titled Purity and Danger. In it, she wrote something that Franklin or Stephen Girard or any good central banker since the onset of time has understood implicitly: “Money can only perform its role of intensifying economic interaction if the public has faith in it. If that faith is shaken, the currency is useless.”\n\nLike Charlie and my other colleagues, I have every desire to use monetary policy to intensify economic interaction, to keep breeding jobs and growing our economy, so that we might keep America strong to the thousandth generation. I have no intention of being party to any action that might shake faith in the dollar. The challenge to monetary policy, as I see it, is to achieve the growth part of our mandate in the short term and get “ahead of the curve” without shaking faith in the currency over the long term.\n\nI know that the GIC has other things on its mind than just monetary policy. So let me stop there and answer any questions you might have.",

            "content": "November 14, 2007 Sydney, Australia\n\nThere is a map in the library of our home in Texas charting the sea-lanes that my ancestors and those of my wife took to the United States. Nancy is a direct descendant on her father's side of John Knox; her brother is named Michael Collins; her mother's ancestors are listed in the Domesday Book. It comes as no surprise that her Scotch/Irish/English family sailed directly across the Atlantic to America.\n\nMy family sailed through different waters. My ancestors had a penchant for migrating first to the antipodes of the Southern Hemisphere. My mother's parents sailed from Norway to South Africa to whale and to mine in the late 1800s and never went home. My father's ancestors came here to Australia from a far different place on the English landscape than the one occupied by Nancy's.\n\nWe do not know when the Fishers came to Australia. Nor do we know if they came of their own free will. We do know that my father, Leslie, was born in Toowoomba in 1904, was abandoned by his mother and was poorly kept by his luckless father. In January of 1910, at the age of 6, he was picked up sleeping on the doorstep of a bakery while his father was off begging for food. Thus began an exotic \"walkabout\" that ended happily in America.\n\nIn 1999, when I was negotiating the first stages of the U.S.–Australia Bilateral Trade Agreement as an ambassador and trade representative of the U.S. government, Canberra gave me what could be gathered of my father's files. They include a letter from the director of the State Children's Department of Queensland to the officer in charge of the Toowoomba police, dated April 4, 1913. It reads as follows: \"Leslie Fisher (was placed) under State control as a neglected child to our care by the Police Magistrate … in January 1910. [His] father had no place of abode and was living from hand to mouth.\" It goes on to inquire of the police whether Leslie Fisher, my father, \"has a home of his own, or is he living with any person in the locality?\" My dad was then 9 years old.\n\nTo our knowledge, the director never got an answer back. My father had disappeared, first into an orphanage, then to a series of rather harsh foster homes, then to the streets, where he, too, survived from hand to mouth as a street urchin until 1921, when at age 17 he was taken in as an \"apprentice mechanic\" at the firm of Foster and Dutton.\n\nHe swept the floors and worked a lathe, earning barely enough for food and clothing. At night, he slept on the factory floor. Shortly before he died at the age of 90—he was a tough old buzzard who kept all his marbles until he drew his last breath—he told me about the afternoon he accompanied his employer to a meeting in a hotel in Brisbane. Mr. Dutton ordered tea and tipped the waiter more than he paid my father in a month. It was then and there, my father told me, that he decided he would make something of himself, but that first he had to escape his past.\n\nIn February of 1924, at age 20, he sailed for South Africa—we don't know if he somehow paid his passage or simply stowed away—where he found work as a bus driver in Jo'Berg and eventually found my mother. Once they had saved enough, they sailed for America and the golden shores of California in 1939.\n\nBut America would not immediately have him. The United States was willing to admit my mother but not my dad. And so they shuttled between Los Angeles and Tijuana, a few hundred miles south just over the border on the Mexican side. Dad did what he needed to make a living, selling cars in California and beating the bookies at the then-famous Tijuana Race Track—a skill he no doubt honed as a street gambler and \"two-up\" champion back in Queensland. The U.S. authorities admitted him and my mother to U.S. citizenship in 1947.\n\nThe story gets richer still. In 1948, on the eve of the Red Army's entry into Shanghai, my father was hired to sail to that city to \"collect\" a payment a Chinese company owed a firm called Spazier Chemical and Soap. My mother and two brothers went with him. After a bit of time and effort, he succeeded in collecting the money, and they sailed out on the S.S. President Wilson back to Los Angeles. It was one of the last ships to leave Shanghai before China's troops closed down all passage. They brought back more than what was due Spazier Chemical: They brought me. I was born eight months after the Wilson left China.\n\nIncidentally, 50 years later, when I was helping negotiate the U.S. side of the deal to bring China into the World Trade Organization, Madam Wu Yi, who oversaw China's team, told me I must have gotten my luck in life from being \"Made in China.\"\n\nSoon after I was born, we moved to Mexico City, where I received my primary school education, and from there began the serendipitous life that was more than generously summarized by Tony Richards in that kind introduction.\n\nAlthough he led a rough life here, my father taught us to be proud of our Aussie heritage. He said he was just an example of the tenacity of Australians. \"They are the best brawlers and fighters in the world,\" he would say. And, for puckish good measure, he would add, \"and they love beer and bikinis.\"\n\nI am the product of an Australian walkabout of epic proportion, a testimony to the fact that Australians are the hardiest of peoples. I understand you have heard from some of my Fed colleagues via satellite, but I am very proud, as a son of an archetypically hardy Australian, to be the first representative of the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC) of the U.S. Federal Reserve System to address the Australian Business Economists in person. Thank you, Robert [Henderson], for inviting me here.\n\nI have recited this long and bizarre history not just out of familial pride, but because I know some among you feel the U.S. is a bit closed-minded about globalization and tends to think myopically—either because we are so bloody large or by virtue of having been a pretty-much self-contained economic powerhouse for so long. I was \"assembled\" in China from English/Australian and Norwegian/South African parts, was \"programmed\" in Mexico and realized my \"value added\" in the United States. You can't get much more globalized than that!\n\nMany of the governors and fellow bank presidents I serve with on the FOMC may have less complicated backgrounds, but they also get the picture: The economy in which we set monetary policy is entirely different from that of our FOMC forbearers, placing new demands on our skill sets.\n\nI will focus my comments tonight on the current state of the U.S. economy. Having just invoked my colleagues, I should mention, as I always do, that my comments this evening are in no way the official position of the U.S. Federal Reserve or the FOMC. They are my views, and mine alone.\n\nRecent Developments in the U.S. Credit Markets\n\nYou are all well aware of the events that began to rattle the credit markets in August. Indeed, the media and analyst coverage of the market turbulence has been so extensive that you would have had to have gotten lost on the walking tour around Ayers Rock last July and just now found your way back to civilization to be unaware of subprime mortgages, collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), structured investment vehicles (SIVs) and the write-downs taken by several leading financial institutions. The disruptions to the orderly functioning of the financial markets have been significant, and the Fed and other central banks around the world have acted to keep those markets functioning. Beyond the troubles in financial markets, we have had an otherwise healthy economy in the U.S., with, thus far, the only other significant signs of weakening coming from continual corrections in the housing market.\n\nThe Federal Reserve took action in mid-August, first lowering the discount rate by a half percentage point at a specially convened session of the FOMC, making clear we, like all learned central bankers, had read Walter Bagehot. Then, at our regular September meeting, we cut the federal funds rate by a half percentage point and the discount rate by the same amount. By the time we met again on October 30 and 31, the hardening of the arteries or the blocking of the aorta, or whatever cardiovascular analogy you choose to describe what was afflicting the circulatory system of the credit markets, was no longer as severe and life threatening as it was in August. Indeed, investors had begun moving toward marking financial assets and exposures to market—pricing them according to what they might actually be bought or sold for—rather than at values posited by hypothetical mathematical models.\n\nA startling statement appeared in the Financial Times on October 26: A particularly astute market operator commented that \"corporate treasurers are no longer investing in things they don't understand.\" Imagine that! Investors are coming home from la la land. To be sure, they are not out of the woods quite yet, and they have miles to go before they, and we as central bankers, sleep. But they have gone beyond suspended reality. You might say the credit markets have gone from the ridiculous to the subprime; the subprime and related derivatives market is the focus of angst, but the ridiculous practice of the suspension of reason in valuing all asset classes appears to be in remission, if not over.\n\nWe have a way to go before full recovery and must acknowledge that shocks and accidents might happen. Phrasing it politely, as an Aussie-Texan, I suspect some real \"cow patties\" remain in some prominent institutional punchbowls in the U.S. and abroad, and they will undoubtedly come to light before too long. I would submit, however, that we are on our way back to markets priced by reason rather than fantasy and that systemic risk has been lessened substantially.\n\nWhile the Federal Reserve remains ready to act if needed—as we have hopefully made clear by our actions and statements—I believe it was appropriate for the FOMC to focus squarely on the economy at its October 30 and 31 meeting.\n\nThe Outlook for the U.S. Economy\n\nAt 11 o'clock tomorrow morning Dallas time, the U.S. economy will officially be entering its seventh year of expansion. Here is how I view our economic situation from my perch at the Dallas Fed. To begin, one has to take account of the corrections from a long period of excessive inflation of the U.S. housing stock. The sharp turnaround in mortgage availability will influence consumer spending by affecting both the amount of household wealth and the ability of homeowners to tap that wealth. Because mortgage availability has changed so much so quickly, the precise effect of this change is hard to gauge and is thus worrisome. Yet, it may also be subject to overstatement, given the Fed's response. The overstatement may also be partly due to the news media's penchant for \"instant analysis\"—my favorite oxymoron, akin to jumbo shrimp or nonalcoholic beer—which tends to focus on the downside. The flexibility and recuperative power of our extraordinarily adaptive economy creates a dynamic often overlooked by pessimistic pundits and even some thoughtful economists. My soundings find no appreciable, let alone debilitating, signs of spillover into the rest of the economy as yet. To be sure, the economy has been weakened, but it has not shown signs of succumbing to the full-blown virus infecting housing.\n\nGoing back to January, and even more so since the spring, banks in my district and elsewhere have reported tightening terms and standards on loans to businesses and households, and the overall mood of the country as reported by the press is sour. Yet, we haven't seen sharp increases in initial jobless claims, dangerously low Purchasing Managers Index readings or persistent declines in durable goods orders. The service sector—which people too often forget accounts for 83 percent of the U.S. economy versus 11 percent for manufacturing, 5 percent for construction and mining, and 2 percent for agriculture—remains strong and productive. Indeed, economic growth was robust enough in the first estimate of third quarter growth to ring in at 3.9 percent. In an economy the size of the U.S., that means we added over $150 billion in output from July through September—a lot of new economic activity. What we added to GDP in just one three-month period exceeds the total annual output of your neighbor New Zealand by 50 percent!\n\nHouseholds are still reasonably optimistic, although perhaps a bit more cautious, about their job prospects, and consumer spending continues to grow at a decent clip. There remain widespread reports of labor shortages all across the country. Texas, where over 247,000 net new jobs have been created year to date, representing between 15 and 20 percent of the jobs created in the entire U.S. this year.\n\nThe bottom line? A fat left tail where some risk of substandard growth is clearly on the growth probability curve, but the more likely outcome is for the U.S. economy to continue to expand at a sustainable pace.\n\nIn part, this is due to service sector strength, infrastructure and durable goods spending that is running better than expected, fiscal stimulus and strong export performance. U.S. overseas sales have been propelled by increasing demand and facilitated by a progressively weaker dollar. We meet tonight as the trade-weighted dollar skates along a post-Bretton Woods low—not an easy thing for a strong-dollar man to note.\n\nCertainly, some risk remains that downward momentum will emerge. Personally, I worry about the plight of big population states like Florida and California, where the housing correction is having its severest impact. I note the reports issued by express shippers and ground transportation firms that show deceleration in year-over-year trends in pre-holiday traffic across the nation. I realize that Wal-Mart and other large retailers have seen a slowing in same-store sales growth, that shopping mall traffic is down, and that the restaurant business—a not-insignificant part of the service sector that employs 14 million Americans—is showing signs of strain as customers migrate from casual dining to more affordable fast-food providers. And, if you parse the data for the third quarter, you will see a pretty stout guesstimate of inventory accumulation. These are prototypical signs of an economy in stress.\n\nYet, before each FOMC meeting, I consult 35 CEOs from a broad range of businesses, and with the exception of homebuilders, not a single one of them feels the economy is at risk of falling off the table. Big builders and engineering firms report a booming domestic infrastructure business, especially in the petrochemical sector from the Gulf Coast up through the lower Midwest. The tech folks continue to find demand brisk—as manifest in earnings reports of Microsoft, Apple and others.\n\nOne of the biggest providers of computer services to businesses reports that, with the exception of financial institutions, sales have begun to flow again after being laid low by the uncertainty of August. The airlines report recent volume has been \"less bad\" than it was in the third quarter. Shippers and railroads are concerned about consumer holiday demand and note slowing trans-Pacific shipments into the U.S. Yet, they report that the tech product side of what they move looks good, so the net impact, while nowhere near robust, is that conditions have not materially worsened. Outside of housing and payments due to some major law firms, we are not seeing a significant lagging of receivables. The mention of law firms may have caught your ear. They have grown quite important to the U.S. economy. Nearly one million people work in legal services in America, roughly the same number who work in manufacturing automobiles and auto parts.\n\nInflation\n\nAs they survey the economic landscape, many of my business interlocutors, however, worry about prices. As do my staff and I. We have been experiencing a mitigation of inflationary forces and expectations recently, whether measured by such headline numbers as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or the index of Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) or the so-called core indexes that exclude energy and food prices. And we have seen it in the trimmed mean measurement preferred by the Dallas Fed.\n\nYet, there appears to be some uncertainty about whether we will continue to see inflation slowing. Partly this stems from retailers who report cost increases on goods imported from China or from shippers who see continuous upward pressure on lease rates to move more expensive imports across the seas. We are also hearing it in other anecdotal reports, such as the rise, nationwide, of salaries paid to attorneys, architects and other highly skilled professionals.\n\nOur concern about inflation at the Dallas Fed stems from two more pervasive sources—food and energy, where we foresee a risk of a more pernicious pass-through effect than we saw in the recent price increases of underlying commodities.\n\nIn food markets, we have seen a dramatic divergence this past year between food prices and the core measures that indicate inflation in the 2 percent range. The CPI shows food up 5 percent through September. Green grocery prices are rising at a double-digit pace. The Producer Price Index for finished consumer foods, or wholesale food prices, is up 4.3 percent year to date. This pattern has historical precedent. A spread of the current magnitude between food price inflation and the core index occurred on several occasions between 1957 and 1980. But we have not seen it in a quarter century.\n\nAs Australians, you know better than anyone about the dramatic increase in milk prices, to say nothing of grains and other foodstuffs that go into feeding any creature that walks on two or four legs. This is hardly encouraging, given that these price increases are occurring against a ramping up of the caloric and protein intake of a few billion new eaters in China, India and elsewhere. All told, it injects a modicum of doubt about the wisdom of predicting further significant declines in inflationary pressures.\n\nEnergy price dynamics further cloud the picture. If you talk to any of the major and independent oil companies, they will tell you they have no problem in finding oil or refining it or delivering final products. They will note, however, two key impulses that are at work:\n\nFirst, they see no evident slowing in the growth of demand for energy in the U.S. The energy appetite in the BRICs—the big, fast-growing nations of Brazil, Russia, India and China—is voracious, and they are only part of the developing world. An enormous amount of chemical plant infrastructure and capacity is being constructed everywhere—from the U.S. Gulf Coast to the Middle East to China and Singapore—to be nearer to either feedstocks or growing final demand. Any analysis of the income elasticity of oil demand in low-income but rapidly growing nations like China and India points to even faster rises in energy consumption, with concomitant price consequences.\n\nSecond, price pressures at the margin are compounded by noncommercial activity in the markets that trade oil. Noncommercial contracts—the busywork of the \"city refiners\" in the financial exchanges in London and other places—have been running at triple their traditional volume lately.\n\nPrices for gasoline and distillates—where the pass-through rubber hits the consumer price road—are starting to inch up in response. Our retail gasoline price models at the Dallas Fed envision pump prices above $3 a gallon for the foreseeable future if crude stays above $85. Price pressures for other distillates are also becoming increasingly probable. And last, high inventories continue for natural gas, but it is noteworthy that prices have reversed their summer slide downward to $5.50 per million BTU and are now quoted at $7.15 at the Henry Hub in Louisiana, the key metric point for the U.S.\n\nAll this gives me a sense of discomfort on the headline inflation front, and it is a reminder that the balance of risks is not skewed unilaterally toward slower growth. This is not to say I expect inflation to veer out of control. But rather, it means that we must remain far from smug on the inflation front and must conduct monetary policy bearing in mind that the battle against the nemesis of inflation is a perpetual effort.\n\nThis vigilance has always been second nature for the subgenus of the human species known as central bankers. Like the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Federal Reserve and the FOMC rely on an impressive array of instruments in determining monetary policy that contains inflation so as to enable sustainable economic growth. We are blessed with a rich complement of superb economists and a fulsome dashboard of databases. But in the end, no models or formulas substitute for judgment in making monetary policy.\n\nOur job has been made more complicated by globalization—the freer flow of goods, services, money, ideas and people across national borders. Its present incarnation owes a great deal to the revolution in information technology. Faster, cheaper and better communications are breaking down barriers to international business and knitting the world's economies closer together faster than Skippy could outsmart a pack of hungry dingoes.\n\nConsider how this affects employment, which under our dual mandate the Fed is duty-bound to maximize without upsetting price stability. Computers, the Internet and fiber optics have opened new horizons for virtual immigration, which allows companies to assign tasks to workers nearly anywhere in the world. We can now tap into the intelligence on the ground in Slovakia or Mumbai as easily as you do in Sydney or Melbourne. Communications technology gives us the tools to get around—at least partly—the restraints imposed by physical location. It allows businesswomen and men to better manage their cost of goods and services sold, as well as their cost of capital, and to sell to a larger market, in their never-ending search to expand profit margins. That is the good news. The not-so-good news is that demand-pull and cost-push pressures abroad are transmitted more readily and ubiquitously to us at home.\n\nFor central bankers, this creates a challenge. We have yet to develop the tool kit we need to understand a technology-driven, seamless, globalized economy well enough to craft monetary policy with the precision we would like. In our eclectic community, we have been debating how monetary policy is affected by globalization, technological and communication innovations, and the implications of the economic evolution into a services-driven, knowledge-based economy. How do we as policymakers, attempting to influence the course of our respective economies, navigate the economic seas when these new forces are acting like a magnet beside our traditional compass, rendering us unsure as to how far off course we may be veering? Globalization is, in my view, particularly vexing as we seek the true north of inflation control.\n\nIf we are guided by core inflation, we run certain risks. Core inflation refers to prices measured through statistical procedures that systematically strip out certain items from the basket of consumer prices—in the U.S., usually food and energy. By ignoring items whose price movements display significant short-run volatility, so the argument goes, statisticians and policymakers can get a better sense of underlying trends in consumer price inflation. The goal is to strip out the noise so that we can focus on the underlying signal.\n\nIn principle, the concept of core inflation is sound. Because underlying price trends change only gradually, we will get a better sense of where overall inflation will be tomorrow if we look at measures that help us assess current trends, rather than at the recent behavior of headline inflation that includes all items, including volatile ones that skew the results.\n\nIn addition, the prices of most things are \"sticky;\" that is, they don't change minute by minute or day by day depending on market conditions. Some models now in vogue suggest that central banks should focus their attention on stabilizing an index of the stickier prices in the economy. Food and energy prices are manifestly not sticky in our economy and, so the theory goes, should not be the focus of our attention.\n\nCentral banks have good reasons to subtract volatile swings in prices, but routinely excluding food and energy—and only food and energy—is not, in my opinion, the best we can do. For one thing, not all food and energy prices are excessively volatile. Menu prices at restaurants, for example, are sticky, making information about their underlying trends quite valuable. Yet, a Big Mac is excluded from the usual core measurements, even though consumers eat millions of them every day. At the same time, other prices can be extremely volatile. Prices of infants' clothing, for example, are at least as volatile as most food and energy items, but they are included in standard \"ex food and energy\" versions of the CPI and PCE.\n\nA more discriminating approach might be to exclude the items with the most extreme price changes in a given period, regardless of whether those items are food, energy or anything else. This is the rationale behind trimmed mean measures of core inflation that guide our thinking. At the Dallas Fed, our measure excludes, or trims out, the extreme highs and lows of price changes each month for the PCE. A trimmed mean measure is also used by the Reserve Bank of Australia.\n\nThe concept behind core inflation measures—seeking to eliminate noise and focus on signal—by disregarding food and energy prices altogether may be a sound practice in a relatively closed world with a predictable sense of the number of consumers and consumer patterns. This is what we had for a couple of generations during the Cold War era, led by an ultra-dominant U.S. economy; eliminating food and energy to silence a significant source of noise made sense in this structure.\n\nHowever, a tectonic shift has occurred. Globalization, rapid acceleration of technological innovation and a series of key geopolitical events have created an open economy infinitely more complex and decidedly more unpredictable. The world economy now incorporates China, India and the former captives of Soviet and Southeast Asian communism, and their caloric and BTU intake patterns are converging toward ours as they grow richer. Three billion people have entered the world's market, and they are ready to work, ready to innovate and ready to shop. As a result, we are undergoing a sustained period of fundamental economic change that is forcing us to reexamine energy and food price movements through different lenses.\n\nWhen we pay more for food and energy, it may no longer represent mere noise but might be providing signals of longer-term, structural inflationary pressures.\n\nIn these circumstances, a trimmed mean approach has merit. A trimmed mean approach will still trim out volatile noisy numbers, which might include food or energy in any given measurement period. But it will retain, and thus allow us to focus on, the signals sent to help determine the true course of inflation.\n\nNow, before you rush out from dinner saying that Richard Fisher weighed in against Mr. [Peter] Costello on behalf of the Reserve Bank, let me point out that trimmed means—while better than the standard ex-food, ex-energy core measurements—are imperfect things. A few items that have important implications for our living standards—computers being the prime example—experience large, technology-driven price declines month in and month out and hence get trimmed out. The Dallas Fed tries to correct for this potential source of bias through our choice of trimming proportions, but we realize that correction is imperfect.\n\nAn additional drawback is that while the theoretical virtues of trimmed mean measures may appeal to central bank aficionados and econometricians, they may fail to resonate with the people we serve. Humans—real people like my father and others who appreciate brawls, beer and bikinis—experience inflation and develop inflationary expectations based on what they see and experience in the marketplace and read in the papers. To people who drive to work, air-condition their home and eat, ex-food, ex-energy measures or trimming this or that out of a price index is nonsense. Central bankers must be attentive to this sensitivity if they are to maintain the public's confidence.\n\nIn formulating and making my arguments at the FOMC table about the direction of inflation, I draw on all three measures—the headline, the core and the trimmed mean number—in making my recommendations on monetary policy. I also draw on an intrinsic admiration for the dynamism and constant inventiveness of a society that can transform the poor and the luckless, like my own family, into middle-class prosperity, time and time again. And presently, viewing the U.S. economy through the lens of globalization, I find that there is greater symmetry of risk between growth and inflation than is commonly surmised.\n\nI will stop here and, in time-honored central banking fashion, now do my best to avoid answering your questions.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "October 12, 2007 Dallas, Texas\n\nThank you, Mr. Chairman, for kicking off what will be a productive and rewarding two-day discussion. On behalf of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, I want to offer each of you a hearty Texas welcome. We are grateful to all of you for coming to spend time with us, to share your insights and wisdom, and to honor our esteemed colleague John Taylor.\n\nChairman Bernanke gave a very nice background on John's work and the significance of his ideas. There is little I can add, except to say that among those characteristics that all of us value so much about John are his decency and likeability. He is a good man, as well as a great scholar and policy aficionado. John, I am especially grateful you are chairing the advisory board of the Dallas Fed's newly launched Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute, if only selfishly because it provides me and my colleagues with a vehicle for continuing to learn from, and work with, you.\n\nJohn Taylor has divided his career between academia and government service, and both spheres owe him a debt of gratitude for having done so. It is, I think, appropriate that this conference honoring John be hosted by a Federal Reserve Bank, because John's interest in monetary policy has been longstanding and has pervaded the research questions he has addressed. Fundamentally, John has demonstrated that it is possible to do serious economic research that takes monetary policy's role in the economy seriously. His efforts in this direction did much to restore a community of interests between academic and Federal Reserve economists at a time when the theoretical foundations underlying traditional monetary policy analysis were crumbling.\n\nEveryone here is familiar with how, back in the late 1970s and early 1980s, John and a few others embraced the notion that households and firms are forward-looking in their decisionmaking and intelligent in forming their expectations, but rejected the view that wages and prices adjust instantaneously to their market-clearing levels. It is these nominal frictions that give policy short-run leverage to influence the real economy. This approach to macroeconomics has grown in popularity to the point that it has become dominant inside and outside the Federal Reserve System. It has also stimulated interest in the nuts and bolts of how labor and product markets work. We have several papers in this conference that dig deep into these questions, and I am looking forward to hearing what the authors have to say about the implications of their research.\n\nCombine rational expectations with forward-looking, maximizing households and firms, and suddenly the private sector's behavior depends on the entire expected future path of policy. John was a pioneer in thinking about monetary policy in this new, rich and complicated setting. This conference will explore some of the literature that John inspired. We will also convene a distinguished panel later today that will help us understand how the new ways of thinking that John pioneered have influenced actual policy here and abroad.\n\nBefore we begin the discussions, I want to thank those of you who came great distances to join us today. Otmar Issing, Frank Smets and Volker Wieland all came over from Europe to be with us. Danke schön meine herren. Guillermo Ortiz came up from la Ciudad de México. Muchas gracias muy amigo mío. Bienvenido. We have attendees from the Norges Bank, Banque de France, the Bank of Japan and the strong currency haven of the Bank of Canada, and, to prove that good people are willing to travel long distances to honor John, from the Reserve Banks of both Australia and New Zealand. Wherever you have come from, we appreciate your presence.\n\nI especially wish to thank the gentlemen who poured their blood, sweat and tears—and a bit of the Dallas Fed's treasure—into organizing this conference: Lawrence Christiano, Robert Leeson, Andrew Levin and our own Evan Koenig. They deserve a special pat on the back. And last, but certainly not least, John, thank you for agreeing to this conference. We are honored to have the privilege of honoring you.\n\nWe have an exciting couple of days ahead of us. Without further ado, let's get started with the paper by Robert Leeson, Francesco Asso and George Kahn.",

            "content": "October 4, 2007 Charlotte, N.C.\n\nThank you for such a warm introduction laced with good old Southern hospitality. It is a special pleasure to address the Charlotte Economics Club. Harvey Rosenblum, the Dallas Fed's director of research, spoke to this group about five years ago and still recalls the experience fondly. Like me, Harvey was hosted by Enrique Sanchez, who has been gracious and kind. Charlotte is clearly a vibrant city, the headquarters now of nine Fortune 500 companies and two of the nation's largest banks. Between Dallas and Charlotte, I would say we about have it wrapped up.\n\nThe Fed has been getting a fair amount of attention in the last few months—almost as much as O.J.'s sports memorabilia collection and the New York Mets' spectacular fall from grace. We central bankers are unaccustomed to being in the limelight—let's face it, we are an unexciting lot. Not many people are proud to admit being devotees of the \"dismal science.\" You know the story of the fellow who goes to his doctor in Dallas to get the report on his latest physical. The doctor looks at him and says, \"Look, pal. I am going to tell it to you straight. You are fatally ill. I suggest that you marry an economist and move to East Texas.\" \"Jeez,\" the crestfallen man says, \"this is awful. I am astonished. Let me see if I get your drift. Are you telling me that if I marry an economist and move to East Texas I will live longer?\" \"No,\" says the doctor. \"But it sure as heck will feel that way.\"\n\nWith all the hoopla over credit markets, British bank runs, commercial paper, moral hazard, the shriveling housing market and you-know-whose new memoir, I thought it would do us all some good to step away from the hot topics of the day. I'd like instead to reflect upon the less-than-scintillating topic of inflation and price measurement. It is not the stuff of headlines, but it is important. If you indulge me this privilege, I would be happy to take questions on any and all subjects during the Q&A period after my monologue and place my talent for obfuscation on full display.\n\nBefore I begin, let me state up front that whenever I speak, it is only to express my personal views. I am not speaking on behalf of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nMost of you are no doubt familiar with the Consumer Price Index (CPI), that broad inflation measure the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) publishes, like clockwork, once a month. We usually refer to that number as \"headline inflation\" because of the press coverage it gets. The BLS' monthly report includes another inflation measure, called \"core inflation,\" which excludes food and energy. Once a month, the Bureau of Economic Analysis releases headline and core versions of another closely watched price index—the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) deflator.\n\nIt is the core measures that I want to focus on today and, specifically, why food and energy items have been deliberately and systematically ex-ed out when we look at price movements. It boils down to what engineers call a \"signal extraction\" problem; struggling to eliminate \"noise\" in our monthly inflation measures and trying to maximize the amount of \"signal.\" The question is: Is this still the best way to separate the wheat from the chaff?\n\nLet's start with a little history: The term core inflation was coined in the early 1980s, but the practice of stripping certain components from the basket of consumer prices began much earlier. Contrary to popular belief, it was food, not energy, that first got the \"ex\" axe. The BLS has produced an \"ex food\" version of the CPI since the late 1950s, probably because food prices in the 1950s were even more volatile than they are today. The practice of reporting a CPI excluding both food and energy prices began when energy price volatility dramatically increased in the 1970s.\n\nBy ignoring items whose price movements display significant short-run volatility, statisticians and policymakers can get a better sense of underlying trends in consumer price inflation. Because the trends change only gradually, measures that give us a better sense of what they are today provide a better sense of where overall inflation will be tomorrow. To make inflation forecasts over the next 12, 18 or 24 months, we are much better off looking at the recent behavior of a core measure—whether ex food and energy or a trimmed mean, which I will define in a moment—than we are looking at the recent behavior of headline inflation.\n\nThat is the statistical argument. A theoretical argument offers somewhat more subtle reasoning for using core measures. It goes something like this: Even in the age of the Internet, sellers of goods and services cannot change prices every day. They have menus, they have price tags and they have price-sensitive customers who live on budgets. Adjusting prices is a costly affair and not something that most sellers would do with every change in market conditions.\n\nMy local Starbucks, for example, does not slash prices on days or for hours when foot traffic is unusually slow, nor does it raise prices when the place is packed and the line is out the door. It does not change them in response to day-to-day movements in its cost of materials. In fact, it was just nine weeks ago that Starbucks adjusted its beverage prices systemwide, about 10 months after its last price adjustment. It is to this sort of pricing behavior that economists affix the elegant and intellectually snappy designation of \"sticky.\"\n\nWhen inflation picks up, firms that have delayed raising prices even as their costs have risen eventually do increase their prices. When the sticky prices become unstuck, the hike will be significant. Of course, not all sticky-price firms will raise their prices in lockstep with each other. The varied timing of the price increases creates a distortion in consumer spending. To correct for these factors, some economists suggest that central banks should focus on stabilizing an index of a basket of goods whose prices are especially sticky.\n\nFood and energy prices are manifestly not sticky in our economy and, so the theory goes, should not be the focus of our attention. To put it differently, theory suggests that a central bank should pay more attention to the occasional increases in the price of a Starbucks latte than to the daily price swings at the corner Exxon station.\n\nCentral banks have good reasons to subtract volatile swings in prices, but routinely excluding food and energy—and only food and energy—is not, in my opinion, the best we can do. For one thing, not all food and energy prices are excessively volatile. Menu prices at restaurants, for example, are sticky, making information about their underlying trends quite valuable. Our Starbucks coffees are excluded from the usual core measurements, even though American consumers drink many millions of them every day—including the one I had this morning. At the same time, other prices can be extremely volatile. Prices of infants' clothing, for example, are at least as volatile as most food and energy items, but they are included in standard \"ex food and energy\" versions of the CPI and PCE.\n\nA more discriminating approach would be to exclude the items with the most extreme price changes in a given period of time, regardless of whether those items are food, energy or anything else. This is the rationale behind trimmed mean measures of core inflation. The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland produces such a measure for the CPI, and we at the Dallas Fed produce one for the PCE. These measures exclude, or trim out, the extreme highs and lows of price changes each month.\n\nMany of the arguments for excluding food and energy—in particular, the statistical arguments—are based on the notion that an exceptionally large price increase today will be offset, somewhere down the road, by an exceptionally large price decline. But suppose the increases in food and energy prices we've been seeing over the past few years represent longer-lived trends, rather than transitory blips. The arguments made for excluding food and energy prices would be on shaky ground. To put it more succinctly, we risk throwing out the signal along with the noise.\n\nCharlie Bean, the chief economist of the Bank of England who is on the Advisory Board of the Dallas Fed's Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute, posed an interesting question after noting that globalization not only delivers freighters full of inexpensive electronics, toys and apparel to consumers in the U.S. and Europe but also puts upward pressure on the prices of energy and other commodities. What sense does it make, the real Mr. Bean asks, to exclude the food and energy price increases from our inflation gauges while incorporating the price declines on the other goods that we buy?\n\nCharlie was making a point in support of the Bank of England's policy of looking only at headline inflation and explicitly eschewing core measures in its official communications, projections and analyses. The European Central Bank does this as well. Our northern neighbors at the Bank of Canada describe their goals in terms of a headline measure but give an explicit role for a core measure—the CPI excluding the eight most volatile items—as an operational guide.\n\nI prefer to make this an argument in favor of trimmed means: As often as food and energy prices are excluded from the \"upper tail\" of our Dallas Fed measure, items like toys, electronics and apparel are excluded from the \"lower tail.\" The trimmed mean meets both requirements of a good inflation gauge. It filters the noise created by excessively volatile prices. At the same time, it hews to Dr. Bean's observation that inflationary impulses can come from any part of the economy, including food and energy.\n\nIn practice, monetary policymakers look at a wide range of inflation gauges. Most of the participants on the FOMC prefer the core PCE. In Dallas, we have an official preference for the Trimmed Mean PCE. We have been producing this measure for over two years now. It excludes the items that consumers buy in a given month that have experienced the largest price increases or decreases, regardless of whether they are food or energy or any other consumable good or service. The particular items that get excluded from the top and bottom of the distribution of price changes will vary from month to month, but the proportions excluded remain the same: about 25 percent off the top and about 19 percent off the bottom, when items are weighted by their shares in spending. We end up with an inflation measure that does a better job of separating the noise from the signal.\n\nIn August, the annualized Trimmed Mean PCE came in at 1.6 percent, the same as July. August saw large price decreases for energy items—gasoline in particular—along with large price increases in several food components. Outside of food and energy, some of the more significant noisy items excluded were large price declines in jewelry and watches and men's and boys' apparel and large increases in the cost of dental care and bank services. Other items trimmed out in August included guns and ammunition, which fell in price significantly, and funeral expenses, which increased in price. I'll let you decide for yourself if the two price swings were related, but I will tell you that we have had to trim both of those items before because their prices moved the same way.\n\nLet's compare that number—1.6 percent—to other inflation measures. The annualized headline PCE rate, which includes all prices, was –0.9 percent for August, with a sharp drop in energy prices contributing to the negative rate. Annualized core PCE, or PCE ex food and energy, came in at 1.1 percent.\n\nOver the past 12 months, the trimmed mean moved down slightly to 2.1 percent, while both core and headline PCE came in at 1.8 percent. If the monthly trimmed mean numbers continue their downward drift of the past few months, the 12-month trimmed mean inflation rate could fall below 2 percent as well.\n\nThe argument about core-versus-headline measures in monetary policy is distinct from a more common and commonsensical complaint about excluding food and energy prices from inflation gauges. You saw it articulated in the latest edition of Newsweek.[1] People, including economists living in married bliss in East Texas, do not stop eating or air-conditioning their homes when food and energy prices jump. Excluding them suggests a disregard for the impact on real people. I empathize and sympathize. Keep in mind, however, that the price indexes a central banker uses to frame, craft and evaluate monetary policy need not be the same as the ideal index used for measuring the cost of living. Indeed, there are macroeconomic models suggesting that if wages are stickier than prices, a central bank would do well to focus on an index of wages rather than prices. I just can't imagine central bankers lasting very long in their jobs if they continually announced to the public their desire to hold down wage growth.\n\nLet me turn now to the factors driving the recent behavior of food and energy prices—with a particular eye to the question of whether those factors are likely to be transitory or persistent.\n\nMany factors impact the process of getting food and energy products to consumers, many of which are beyond anyone's control. A growing season in one part of the country or the world that is unusually wet or dry, hot or cold—like the drought Australia is having, for example—can lead to variations in crop production, leaving too much or too little to go around and large price changes from season to season or year to year at the checkout counter. Large swings in prices will follow. Shutting down just one major refinery—or several, as occurred along the Gulf Coast two years ago—can lead to declines in gasoline supplies and sharp rises in pump prices.\n\nIn economist-speak, supply and demand for both food and energy are inelastic, so even small changes in supply or small changes in demand translate into large changes in prices.\n\nThat is what economists have in mind when designing inflation measures that exclude food and energy—a paradigm in which the shocks are primarily transitory and have large but fleeting impacts on prices. But is that what's going on now? We have just enjoyed a fine lunch, so let's start with food.\n\nOver the short run, the supply of food depends primarily on the weather, but the decisions of individual farmers and ranchers also play a role in pricing. Farmers decide how much of their fields to plant in corn versus soybeans, and chicken producers, hog farmers and ranchers determine the size of their flocks or herds based on forecasts of the prices expected to prevail at harvest or market time. We usually think of demand as relatively fixed in the short run, but it is not so stable that farmers and ranchers do not sometimes err in their predictions. When Mother Nature runs amok or demand forecasts prove mistaken, or both, we end up with either gluts or shortages that require large price movements to clear markets.\n\nEven over several years, weather can still play a role in prices—witness the persistent drought conditions in the Upper Midwest or, as previously mentioned, Australia. But over the long haul, the main drivers of food supply are technological advances and the agricultural sector investment that fosters mechanization, higher yielding crop varieties and the like. On the demand side, long-term trends are primarily driven by growth in population and wealth. Changes in preferences can result from recognition of the health benefits or detriments of certain types of food, but the largest driver is surely growth in per capita income. Richer societies consume more calories, and a greater share of those calories is accounted for by animal proteins.\n\nIn the Industrial Age and the present post-Industrial Knowledge Age, agricultural innovation and investment have enabled the supply of food to grow at a faster pace than demand, confounding the gloomy forecasts of Parson Malthus. Look back in time and you'll see food becoming less and less expensive relative to other goods and services, even as the number of mouths to feed around the globe has increased and consumption per capita has grown. The price of corn, for example, may have increased noticeably over the past year, but it remains a bargain from a historical perspective: In 1860, the price of a bushel of corn was about 50 cents; translated into today's dollars, that is about $12 a bushel. The current price is a bit over $3.\n\nIt is true that the long decline in relative food prices has been punctuated by occasional reversals as the pace of technological advance has fluctuated or as demographics have changed. I remain optimistic about the very long-run trend of declining food prices, but I do recognize that we may be in the midst of one of those reversals as the world economy adjusts to recent changes in demand. Biofuels production may be playing a part in today's rising agricultural prices, but I believe this is minor in comparison to the evolving eating habits of billions of Chinese and Indians, the Vietnamese and former captives of the Soviet Union, Brazilians and Mexicans and others who are becoming increasingly wealthy. This reversal may take several years to play out before technology and investment can respond with sufficient supplies to put food prices back on their long-run course. In the meantime, we are subject to \"agri-flation\" that may be more sustained than we would like.\n\nOn the energy front, prices are shaped by demand and supply, just like most everything else we buy and sell. Demand is determined by improvements in energy-use technology and the world economy's growth rate, including the breakneck pace set of late by the so-called BRIC countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China. Because energy consumption is not very responsive to prices in the short run and little excess capacity currently exists in the world's energy-supply chains, small changes in the real or perceived balance between supply and demand can result in very sharp price swings.\n\nLong-term energy supply is determined by the development of fuel resources—both conventional and alternative. Short-run production disruptions, actual or potential, can greatly affect energy prices. Geopolitical events buffet energy markets every day, whether it is civil unrest in Nigeria, nationalization in Venezuela, fighting in the Middle East, disputes between the West and Iran, or a strong-arming government in Moscow. Perceived changes in supply, including real or anticipated changes to OPEC production levels, can also add volatility to energy prices.\n\nOil prices have been on a steady climb in recent years, tripling since early 2003 and breaching $80 per barrel last month. This worries many people who remember the energy crises of the 1970s and the ensuing recessions. In fact, nine of the 10 post–World War II recessions were preceded by sharply rising oil prices. I will remind you, however, we have had several episodes of sharply rising oil prices in the past 15 years without recessions.\n\nRather than ignoring energy prices because they are dropped from core inflation, I am constantly picking apart energy prices to understand the cause of their recent climb. Here is what I see:\n\nFirst, it is useful to understand whether the run-up in prices is driven by increased demand or reduced supply. If it is reduced supply, like most of the oil price shocks prior to the mid-1990s, slowing economic activity and higher overall prices are likely. If the oil price increase is the result of a demand shock arising from productivity gains, however, we could see expanding economic activity and reduced inflationary pressures.\n\nRecently, the U.S. economy has responded to rising oil prices in a way inconsistent with a classic energy supply shock. Despite rising oil prices over the past four years, gross domestic product continued to grow, unemployment continued to fall and overall price pressures remained relatively moderate. Consumer spending and consumer confidence have remained strong compared with the 1970s or early 1980s. Business investment activity has also stayed on an expansionary course.\n\nEconomic growth in other countries has not been derailed, which has kept demand for our exports at healthy levels. A weakening dollar has not hurt other countries' demand for our products, or their appetite for oil, which is priced in dollars. And inflation has been kept at bay in most countries around the world, thanks in no small part to well-managed monetary policy here and overseas.\n\nAll of these positive signs are not what history teaches us to expect in a rising oil price environment. What gives? Economic research points to a number of factors—including a lower energy-to-GDP ratio, more flexible labor markets, more experience with oil price shocks, better monetary policy and less-rigid regulatory hurdles on energy-producing firms and such energy-using industries as airlines and trucking. In addition, the development and maturity of futures markets and derivatives have reduced the need for physical inventories, while securities markets have provided sources of investment capital.\n\nThese factors all seem quite reasonable, but I believe there is more to this story, and I am convinced that the economic resilience we have seen lately is the result of an entirely different phenomenon.\n\nFor a few years now, some economists have suggested that the U.S. economy ought to respond differently to rising oil prices if the increase is the result of stronger demand for oil needed to fuel an expanding U.S. economy rather than a result of diminished supplies. Indeed, several Dallas Fed economists are carefully studying this issue from a global perspective as I speak.\n\nSo far, they have shown that higher oil prices caused by productivity gains have a much different effect on the economy than oil supply shocks. A productivity shock originating in the U.S. will boost our economic output, and the expansion will pull up the price of oil. If monetary policy holds the growth of nominal GDP constant, this will result in a reduction of inflationary pressures. If China or India or some other country is expanding rapidly and it is the country's oil consumption that is increasing, driving up prices, that surge in productivity can yield spillovers for the U.S. in the form of lower import prices and technological gains. As long as this continues, we can expect to see an expansion of output and lower overall prices, even as the world price of oil rises. A vicious cycle is, in a sense, almost transformed into a virtuous cycle.\n\nWith each uptick in energy prices, I ask whether it is supply or demand that is making prices rise. Supply disruptions are cause for concern, but growth in demand is not as worrisome. Most likely, energy prices will continue to be volatile; it is the nature of the beast. The same goes for food prices.\n\nThose of us responsible for crafting U.S. monetary policy cannot afford to be distracted by the flux of short-term price changes that are destined to be unwound. Our eye should be focused on underlying inflationary pressures, some of which may indeed be coming from food and energy markets. Routinely excluding food and oil price movements from our inflation gauges may have made sense in the 1970s, the 1980s and even the 1990s—but not now, nor in the next few years. The conceptual beauty of trimmed mean inflation measures lies in their ability to capture steady increases in food and energy prices, which may be germane to the pursuit of price stability, while excluding the temporary spikes and dips that do not presage changes in the underlying inflation rate.\n\nSpeaking of beauty, conceptual or otherwise, I need to wrap up and get home to my wife in East Texas. By the way, she is not an economist.\n\nMay you all lead long lives.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "October 2, 2007 Dallas, Texas\n\nThank you, Daniel [Frishberg]. The Greater Dallas Chamber was kind enough to invite me here today, and I thank them, too. I am going to take advantage of this opportunity to discuss how technology drives progress in the Knowledge Age. Technology is critically important to the Federal Reserve System. It helps us run the business of the central bank. And yet at the same time, it complicates the business of making monetary policy for the United States.\n\nI wear three hats in the Federal Reserve. I am president and CEO of one of the 12 Banks that operate the Fed's payments system business. I chair the Fed's Information Technology Oversight Committee. And I sit on the Federal Open Market Committee, which is responsible for crafting a monetary policy designed to foster sustainable noninflationary economic growth. Its actions are what the press and financial analysts love to bill and coo about.\n\nWhen I'm wearing my monetary policy hat, I consider IT from one perspective; in my two other roles, I ponder IT from another angle. Let me explain.\n\nFrom the business end, I look at IT as an enabler: It facilitates managing the Federal Reserve System and the business of our Banks. Consider these aspects of our operations:\n\nTake a dollar bill out of your pocket. Printed in bold letters along the top of it are the words \"Federal Reserve Note.\" We do not actually print money—the Treasury does that—but we are responsible for ensuring that the banking system and the economy have the currency they need to function properly. Each year, the Federal Reserve System processes approximately 37 billion of these notes—bills with denominations of $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100. We store them in massive vaults at the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks and use 132 machines to count and sort currency at a rate of 90,000 bills an hour, day in, day out.\n\nWe also process the checks you write. Last year, we processed 9.1 billion paper checks and 1.5 billion electronically imaged checks.\n\nAnd we moved $5 trillion per day between financial institutions to settle their accounts.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System, in short, runs one of the largest financial businesses in the nation, and most of our work is accomplished by moving zeroes and ones through electronic spectra. Most people think we are analytical wonks, collecting, categorizing and correlating massive amounts of data for economic reporting and analysis—all of it needed to conduct monetary policy. But we also run a large, sophisticated materials handling business, involving shipping and receiving, sorting and inventorying. We use advanced scanning and other technological means to ensure currency is genuine and fit for recirculation. We use technology to digitize check images, transmit and store the images, and turn millions of images back into paper for presentation to the paying banks.\n\nOur mainframe processing power totals nearly 9,000 MIPS, or millions of instructions per second, if we have any nongeeks in the audience. Across the system, we have about 4,500 servers and 24,000 desktop computers in use. Our national networks support nearly 3,000 high-bandwidth circuits that reach about 1,500 end points, both internal locations and external customers. To keep this technology functioning, we employ some 3,000 IT professionals.\n\nBy itself, the Dallas Fed—located a few blocks from here on Pearl Street—moved 6.5 billion banknotes through our five-story-deep, robotically controlled vault last year. We are assuming responsibility for processing every paper check written in the western United States, from here to California. And as agent for the Treasury, we just processed our 1 millionth conversion of government-benefit payments from old-fashioned paper checks to direct deposit.\n\nThe Dallas Fed is a bank. We have $40 billion in assets. We make money off of those assets and the fees we charge from lending money and performing services, and we use the proceeds to pay down the federal deficit. Last year, after paying taxes and a healthy 6 percent dividend to our shareholders—the member banks in our district—we paid $1.3 billion into the U.S. Treasury.\n\nAs you can see, the Federal Reserve is a large, sophisticated business. Like any modern company, technology is at the core of our operations. And our cost structure: We spend a third of our budget on IT. It is money well spent. IT enables us to provide our services efficiently and effectively. It facilitates our management of the payments system for the American people. We are as eager as anybody else to exploit technology to reduce our costs and maximize our business returns. As business operators, we are saddled to Moore's curve as much as anybody in this room.\n\nNow, let me remove the hats I wear as a business operator and consider IT from the perspective of making monetary policy in the Knowledge Age.\n\nWhen the 12 regional Bank presidents and the seven Fed governors sit down to determine monetary policy as the Federal Open Market Committee, the great technological advances of our age significantly impact what we do. Why? Because innovations that create new markets, boost productivity or cut costs play a significant role in stimulating economic growth. And they help keep a lid on inflation. In a very palpable sense, advancements in technology aid the Fed in accomplishing its mission of underwriting sustainable noninflationary growth in the world's most powerful economy.\n\nThat is the good news.\n\nTechnological innovation, however, makes the work of central banking more difficult. Innovation foments economic change—think of electricity in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the microchip and Internet in our times. Successive waves of technology destroy old markets and create new ones. They alter cost structures and upset established relationships between inputs and outputs. They change the way economies operate, making the past a less reliable guide to the future. In effect, technological innovation constantly challenges our economic models, relentlessly trashing our operating manuals, much like Internet music downloads are pushing compact discs into the dust bin that contains our cassettes and eight-track tapes and supposedly \"long-playing\" record albums.\n\nThe 1990s illustrate how technology can shake central banking's basic tenets. Advances in information technology achieved a critical mass early in the decade, setting off an unprecedented surge in productivity. The economy began growing rapidly, pushing unemployment down below 4 percent. At the time, the Fed's econometric models flashed warnings about inflationary fires yet to come. The textbook response would have been higher interest rates, aimed at forestalling inflation. Instead, the Fed resisted the conventional wisdom, recognizing the world had changed and the U.S. economy's speed limit had increased. Technology would allow faster growth without kindling inflation.\n\nIt is the very nature of technology to undermine the status quo. This is hardly an original observation. In the period between the two World Wars, the iconic economist Joseph Schumpeter documented the effect of technological change on economic activity. Schumpeter was a man who knew how to pack a lot of meaning into a few words. He used to tell his students at Harvard in the 1940s that he aspired to be the world's greatest economist, the world's greatest horseman and the world's greatest lover. \"Two out of three isn't bad,\" he said in wistful summary of his accomplishments. He did not do well with horses.[1]\n\nIn the realm of economic thought, Schumpeter is best remembered for coining the phrase \"creative destruction,\" a seemingly paradoxical construct that with succinct and sublime precision describes how new ways of doing things continually replace the status quo, destroying jobs, companies and even industries that were rendered antiquated by the newly created technologies and replacing them with new ones.\n\nLet me give you a sample of the power of Schumpeter's insight. \"The fundamental impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion,\" he wrote, \"comes from the new consumers' goods, the new methods of production or transportation, the new markets, the new forms of industrial organization that capitalist enterprise creates.\" He went on to characterize innovation as a force that \"incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one.\"\n\nCapitalism, in other words, is a continuous process of change—out with the old and in with the new. What drives the process? The profit motive. And competition. Schumpeter understood that the most powerful kind of competition was not between rival carriage makers, each offering a better price. No, it is the competition from whole new forms of transportation technology that bring the consumer a whole new way of traveling that eclipses the old.\n\nSchumpeter put it this way: \"A railroad through new country, i.e., country not yet served by railroads, as soon as it gets into working order upsets all conditions of location, all cost calculations, all production functions within its radius of influence; and hardly any â??ways of doing things' which have been optimal before remain so afterward.\"\n\nWith each new generation of technology that you and your companies bring to market, those of us who study and model the economy have to rejigger our assumptions because \"hardly any ways of doing things which have been optimal before remain so afterward.\"\n\nThe history of economic progress has always been shaped by new technologies—by the inventions of platforms that spur economic growth and spread prosperity around the world. The internal combustion engine made horse-drawn transport obsolete, but the new technology also moved people and goods faster and cheaper, saving time and money. The mushrooming numbers of cars, trucks and buses meant jobs for drivers, oilfield workers, road crews, mechanics and millions of others. ATMs culled the ranks of bank tellers, just as robotics replaced human hands on assembly lines and even in medical operating rooms. Eventually, the tellers and factory workers who lost their jobs were shifted to other sectors and contributed to the production of new goods and services that fulfilled human needs and wants.\n\nThis process keeps us on our toes. If you look at back at America's 100 most valuable companies in 1900, you'll see that all but a handful are no longer in business. The reason: new technology and the relentless economic change it unleashes. Take Baldwin Locomotive Works. It built some of the best railroad engines in the country—first steam, then diesel—making it one of the top U.S. companies for decades. But Baldwin Locomotive ceased operations in 1956. Times had changed. Technology had advanced. Baldwin was passed by.\n\nLook at today's most celebrated companies. Along with such perennials as Exxon-Mobil and GE, you'll see thriving enterprises built on technologies that didn't exist when many of you were born—Google, Cisco, Amazon, eBay and Research in Motion. Of course, if they do not stay on their toes, they, too, will eventually follow Baldwin Locomotive into oblivion.\n\nToday, we central bankers are grappling with globalization—the freer flow of goods, services, money, ideas and people across national borders. Its present incarnation owes a great deal to the revolution in information technology. Faster, cheaper and better communications are breaking down barriers to international business and knitting the world's economies closer together faster than the New York Mets can blow a pennant race.\n\nGlobalization proceeds at a pace dictated by technology. The world's economies are rapidly integrating today because communications technologies have made it cheaper and easier to deliver information at great distances and extend supply chains to the far corners of the planet. The Internet and e-mail and cell phones and satellite TV facilitate the exchange of the most valuable resource mankind has ever discovered: knowledge.\n\nConsider how this affects employment, which the Fed is duty-bound to maximize without upsetting price stability. New technologies have opened new horizons for virtual immigration, which allows companies to assign tasks to workers nearly anywhere in the world. We can now tap into the intelligence that is on the ground in Delhi or Dubai as easily as we do that which is in Detroit or Dallas. Communications technology gives us the tools to get around—at least partly—the restraints imposed on physical immigration. Throughout its history, the U.S. economy has benefited greatly from the brain gain, and we cannot continue as the world's technological leader without continuing to import foreign know-how. We hear a lot of talk about offshoring and the harm it purportedly does, but we American business operators have come to recognize how an interconnected world can be our lifeblood, nourishing our economy with a transfusion of knowledge transmitted through the ether of the Internet.\n\nSchumpeter wrote of the power of creative destruction in the context of the industrial era. Those essential lessons also apply, in spades, in our globalizing, knowledge-driven economy, when technological change has become a juggernaut and products' life spans have shrunk. New ideas, new products and new companies are arriving on the scene faster than ever, while new competitors are appearing on the horizon, continually upsetting the status quo. Moore's Law—which embodies the idea that change is recurrent and accelerating—is the fundamental reality of today's world.\n\nThe keynote essay of the Dallas Fed's 2006 Annual Report [2] points out 10 ways globalizing the Knowledge Economy has been raising productivity's level or its growth rate—or both.\n\nPoint No. 1, lower communications and transport costs make products cheaper for consumers and facilitate globalization.\n\nPoint No. 2, when economies become more integrated, competition is enhanced.\n\nAnd, Point No. 3, specialization is enabled.\n\nPoint No. 4, globalization gives companies new ways to ramp up their production functions. They can now access cheaper labor, raw materials and other resources at any time and from anywhere on the globe.\n\nPoints No. 5 and 6, globalization gives producers larger markets, increasing the potential payoff for innovation, business formation and risk taking. Large global markets allow companies to extend their economies of scale by producing to satisfy global, not just domestic, demand. This is particularly powerful in the Knowledge Age, where such things as microchips, pharmaceuticals and entertainment face high initial development costs but low marginal costs to produce.\n\nIn the New York Times the other day, a senior vice president at India's Infosys Technologies succinctly summarized Points 4, 5 and 6 by referring to the future of outsourcing as the ability to \"â?¦take the work from any part of the world and do it in any part of the world.\"[3] He might easily have added, \"and then sell it in any part of the world.\"\n\nPoint No. 7, capital markets expand in a globalized world, freeing money to seek the highest return available and fund development of new production capacity anywhere on the planet.\n\nPoint No. 8, it is easier for productive knowledge to spread across borders, fueled by migration, the Internet, cell phones and trade.\n\nPoint No. 9, globalization erodes national or natural monopoly power, reducing the excess burdens imposed on consumers.\n\nAnd finally, Point No. 10, globalization increases the range—and potential rewards—of goods that can be consumed by more than one person at a time. Just because I'm downloading the most recent episode of The Office from iTunes does not mean someone in Singapore cannot download it at the same time. Which is something you cannot do with the same can of peas or the same steel beam. We have had decades to contemplate the globalization of goods markets—TVs, shoes, clothing, furniture and more, much of it produced by low-wage labor in faraway lands. But the point of the essay in our annual report—copies of which we will have for you as you leave the room—is that today's globalization means international competition has spread beyond manufactured goods. Modern communications technology has brought the reality of globalization to broad realms of the economy that until recent decades had been largely isolated from it. The nexus of technology and globalization brings business opportunities for those of you with vision and entrepreneurial instincts. For central bankers, it creates a challenge. We have yet to develop the tool kit we need to understand a technology-driven, globalized economy well enough to craft monetary policy with the precision we would like.\n\nWe are not alone in feeling somewhat uneasy with the changes swirling about us. A large segment of the public feels threatened by the technology that we in this room embrace, and they fear the globalization it fosters. There is nothing new in this. When he was governor of New York, Martin Van Buren supposedly wrote a missive to President-elect Andrew Jackson in which he said, \"If canal boats are supplanted by â??railroads,' serious unemployment will result. Captains, cooks, drivers, hostlers, repairmen and lock tenders will be left without means of livelihood, not to mention the numerous farmers now employed in growing hay for horses. Boat builders would suffer and tow-line, whip and harness makers would be left destitute. â?¦ As you may well know, Mr. President, â??railroad' carriages are pulled at the enormous speed of 15 miles per hour â?¦ by â??engines' which roar and snort their way throughout the countryside, setting fire to the crops, scaring the livestock, and frightening women and children. The Almighty certainly never intended that people should travel at such breakneck speeds.\"\n\nNow, the Almighty has given us the means to move at the speed of light through cyberspace. Today, technology is again doing what it has always done—creating enormous angst among those it displaces. And yet it is raising living standards and increasing economic efficiency in most parts of the world.\n\nWe live in a time when it is fashionable to look at all glasses as half full. Chicken Little rules the roost of economic prognostication. The innovators in this room know differently. Heirs to Eli Whitney, Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell and the Wright brothers, American entrepreneurs are accustomed to operating in an economy that is the crucible of innovation. Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page, Mark Zuckerberg and, of course, Bill Gates sprang from the American landscape, not from Germany or France or China or India or anyplace else. Inventiveness is part of the American DNA, nurtured in an economic system that encourages innovation and rewards it handsomely. New products and new technologies find fertile soil here in Texas and throughout the United States, where they can be funded and brought to market, only to be challenged in due course by the next round of new products and new technologies.\n\nA free enterprise system recognizes that innovation cannot be predicted or controlled. No part of the computer was invented with the computer in mind. The keyboard came from the typewriter, invented in the 1860s by Christopher Latham Sholes. The first program was written for Joseph Marie Jacquard's loom in 1801, a technology to avoid mistakes made by the weavers. Vacuum tubes and transistors were first associated with radio and then television. The microchip was invented for handheld calculators, not for computers per se. And the electricity that powers it all started out as a better way to light up dark rooms. Mix them all together and—voila—you have a computer, the unintended consequence of a series of separate inventions.\n\nWhat put the computer together was the profit motive—the potential to get rich by exploiting all the connections, all the angles, all the possible products consumers might buy. This is why America is by far the most inventive nation in the world. We are not necessarily smarter, though I would like to think we are. We do not have some intrinsic aptitude that others lack, though I would like to think we are pretty darned clever. We are not always luckier, though we are very lucky people. What we do have that sets us apart is an economic system that provides rewards for those who dare to turn their ideas into realities. We have what you might call incentive aptitude. You give us an incentive, and we'll find an aptitude!\n\nAmerican technology will continue to march forward, as it has for generations. Skeptics have always been proved wrong. Charles Duell once ran the U.S. Patent Office. He would probably be forgotten by now if not for a few words he is purported to have uttered in 1899—after the introduction of telephones, electric lights and automobiles â?¦ but before the next wave of innovation that brought us airplanes, refrigeration, radios and my favorite great invention, the pop-up toaster. In 1899, amid the great burst of innovation, one that rivaled what we see today, Duell infamously proclaimed: \"Everything that can be invented has been invented.\" If Duell had been right, the job of econometricians and monetary policymakers would have been made so much easier. They could have put everything on autopilot. And, as a nation, we would have gone into decline, deprived of the fresh energy of new technology. I'll return to my best buddy—Schumpeter. He knew better. He wrote that \"we cannot reason â?¦ about the future possibilities of technological advance â?¦ those [technologies] that are still in the lap of the gods may be more or less productive than any that have thus far come within our range of observation. ... There is no reason to expect slackening of the rate of output through exhaustion of technological possibilities.\"\n\nWe know not what marvels still sit in the \"lap of the gods.\" But history tells us it is a fool's game to expect a slackening of the rate of technological accomplishment. Some of you may even play starring roles developing the future waves of technology. Your efforts and the fruits of your labor will fuel the incessant revolution of our economic system, making the work of central bankers more confusing and challenging. As sure as I am standing here, I know that your success will make my job harder. I ask only one thing of you:\n\nKeep it up.",

            "content": "September 24, 2007 Dallas, Texas\n\nI am delighted you have invited me back to this symposium, particularly in light of my rather pointy-headed presentation last year on the nitty-gritty of how central bankers measure inflation. I want to avoid any possibility of injuries in a stampede for the exits, so I promise not to inflict a lot of mind-numbing economist jargon on you today. I am going to speak this morning on the importance of having first-class institutions of higher learning in Dallas and in Texas.\n\nI am guessing, however, that you, being in the real estate business, probably know that last Tuesday the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) held a meeting and decided to cut the federal funds rate by one-half of 1 percent, an event that seems to have given rise to almost—but not quite—as much chatter as recent developments affecting the sports memorabilia collection of O.J. Simpson. I also suspect you are eager to hear about the current state of the housing and money markets and the health of the economy. I will indulge your interest briefly and then get on to a message about education that I would like you to listen to very carefully.\n \nWhat I say today, as always, represents my personal views and mine alone. I make no pretense—and never do—of speaking for my colleagues on the FOMC or of representing the views of any other senior Federal Reserve official.\n \nTo put last week’s FOMC decision in a broader context, it is important to understand that the Fed operates under a dual mandate. That dual mandate can be summarized in one sentence: We are charged by Congress with conducting monetary policy in a way that enables sustainable, noninflationary growth of the American economy and its employment base. It goes without saying that we must use our franchise to ensure a smoothly operating financial system. Money is the blood of the body of capitalism. It must be pure and free of the virus of inflation, and the cardiovascular system through which this lifeblood of the economy flows must be in good working order.\n \nAs we sat down to the FOMC table on Tuesday, we were faced with a situation that, drawing on my Naval Academy days, I would liken to a ship navigating a narrow passage between two shorelines.\n\nOn one shore, we have an otherwise healthy economy weakened to an unknown degree by a correction to excessive speculation in its housing sector and related financial instruments. On the price front, the economy has been experiencing mitigation in inflationary tendencies, thanks, I believe, to prudent monetary policy—albeit against a background of an energetic global economy that continues to create upward price pressures on all sorts of commodities, on transportation costs and even on what was once assumed to be an endless supply of cheap imports from China.\n\nIf we had maintained the anti-inflationary course we had been following for more than 14 months by holding the fed funds rate at 5.25 percent, I believe we would have risked oversteering our course and potentially run afoul of the shoals of unacceptably slow economic growth. Those of you who know me are aware that I am a compulsive worrier about inflation—I do not know any central banker in the world worth his or her salt who is not—because I see inflation as the bête noire, or bugbear, of any successful economy. Recent trends in inflationary impulses and expectations, however, appeared to me to provide some wiggle room to adjust our tiller and steer a more growth-oriented course.\n\nLooking to the other shoreline, we were confronting the rocky outcropping that economists call moral hazard. From these rocks, one could hear the siren call of market operators and institutions that had made imprudent decisions and now hoped the Fed would rescue them with easy money. Overcorrecting our course with too aggressive a shift in the fed funds tiller would have, I believe, undermined the discipline that market forces impose upon wayward financial institutions and investors. Moral hazard is a dangerous predicament for any central bank. Yet we had an unsettled money market riddled with angst—a money market that, in my view, was going into a defensive crouch in which even the best and most careful depository institutions and market operators feared that the positions taken by their less prudent brethren may come up a cropper and seize up the entire financial system.\n \nThose were the conditions on the financial seas when we met last Tuesday. As with any navigator of turbulent seas, the FOMC relies on an impressive array of instruments; we are blessed with a rich complement of superb economists and a fulsome dashboard of databases. But in the end, no models or formulas substitute for judgment in making monetary policy. The course of monetary policy is a matter of discernment—akin to the decisions made by a ship captain who knows that steering through a turbulent sea requires drawing on more than just charts and computerized navigation equipment. Drawing upon its best judgment, the committee chose to navigate the passage with a 50-basis-point reduction in base rates, following its Aug. 17 action to reduce the spread between the discount rate and the federal funds rate.\n\nWith any publicly visible decision made at an important juncture, second-guessers pop up everywhere. Market operators and countless others, among them somber as well as bombastic television commentators—armchair navigators, if you will—have been eager to discuss the course we have chosen. This is the nature of a free market for commentary. Personally, I welcome it, as it sharpens our wits.\n\nCentral banking is not and never should be a popularity contest. It is a serious duty undertaken by earnest public servants for the greatest good of the nation. Thus, FOMC members will continue taking in-depth soundings on the progress of the economy and the financial markets as we evaluate the impact of the 50-basis-point course correction. Should further correction—either to port or to starboard—be needed to stay on the course toward sustainable, noninflationary growth over time, we will make it.\n \nEnough about navigation and last Tuesday’s FOMC meeting. I will happily take any questions about policy during the question-and-answer period and, in classic Federal Reserve style, do my best not to answer them.\n\nToday, I want to talk about a subject that is of the utmost importance to Dallas’ future—higher education and why we need to focus on developing the academic and intellectual excellence needed to make this the great city we all want it to be.\n\nThe vital capital stock of our modern economy is not our buildings or our factories or our farms. It is our brains. It is our ability to conjure new and better ideas, inventions and solutions. It is our commitment to exceptional customer service. It is our designs for better buildings, faster computers and more successful space flights. It manifests itself in new financing products and medical breakthroughs, in mathematical formulas and biochemical experimentation, in physics and engineering and design.\n\nEducation and knowledge are the driving forces of a U.S. economy. Remember that agriculture represents less than 2 percent of our national economy and manufacturing employs just 11 percent of our workforce. Only 5 percent of our fellow Americans work in the mining and construction sectors.\n\nEighty-two percent of American workers are employed in services, a sprawling sector that includes some of the nation’s most prestigious and highest-paying jobs—jobs very much like yours. In Texas, for example, average hourly wages in 2005 were $77.23 for doctors of internal medicine, $44.81 for geological engineers, $39.53 for computer software engineers and $26.35 for registered nurses.[1]\n\nJobs like these can be done only by workers with highly specialized skills, nurtured by our educational system and honed by years of experience. Physical strength and manual dexterity, workers’ primary input for so much of what was produced in the agricultural and manufacturing eras, have been replaced by creativity, reasoning and emotional intelligence. We prosper by the work of our brow, not the labor of our muscle.\n\nLet me give you a stark example: At the end of 2005, the U.S. auto and auto parts manufacturing industry employed about 1.1 million workers and added 0.8 percent of the value to our gross domestic product. The legal services sector employed nearly the same number but contributed 1.5 percent of the value added to GDP. In other words, lawyers produce twice as much as automobile workers. Granted, that may not come as much consolation when you open your attorney’s bill, but those are the facts. There is no more vivid demonstration of how services have replaced manufacturing as the engine of our economic prosperity.\n\nMy friend Stanley Fischer, governor of the Bank of Israel, once quipped that “there are three kinds of economists: those who can count and those who can’t.” Yet even mathematically challenged economists are united on this: In the service sector-driven Knowledge Age, education pays huge dividends.\n\nIn today’s economy, you earn what you learn. Spending time and money learning—in gathering knowledge and skills—remains one of the best investments you can make. In 2006, an average 25-year-old high school graduate made $6,100 a year more than someone the same age who dropped out. A high school graduate who went on to college but didn’t get a degree saw earnings rise by another $4,160. Earning an associate’s degree added another $3,100. A bachelor’s degree was worth an additional $15,260. A law, dentistry or other professional degree added $32,300 to earnings. The total, the difference in earnings between a 25-year-old high school dropout and a 25-year-old degreed professional, was almost $61,000 a year.\n\nJust as impressive is the way experience in the workplace compounds the benefits of higher education. The $61,000 earnings gap between high school dropouts and professional degree holders jumps to more than $100,000 by the time these 25-year-olds reach age 60—a 66 percent widening.\n\nWe also see links between educational attainment and job stability, with the best educated among us enjoying the lowest unemployment rates.\n\nYou earn what you learn.\n\nOf course, intellectual capital, like its physical counterpart, can depreciate over time. Skills can fade or be replaced by new technologies and as our economy evolves. Think back just 30 years and you’ll remember that our labor pool included a profession called “typists.” My mother was one of them. Thousands like her earned their livings at clattering keyboards, producing the documents needed in business and government, but their once-rare skills have become nearly universal among computer users worldwide. Or consider medicine. Who among you would feel comfortable with a doctor who stopped learning after medical school and treated you with the principles and procedures of decades past? You expect doctors to be up on the latest research, newest procedures and best medicines to treat you. In today’s knowledge-driven world, none of us can ever claim to know enough. We must embrace lifetime learning if we are to prosper.\n\nIn a modern economy, we can no more deny the link between brainpower and income than we can deny that the Federal Reserve is subject to scrutiny. We see the link between education and earnings appear across countries, among individuals and among states. Little old Massachusetts, for example, with a third-place ranking in college graduates per capita, has lifted itself up to first in per capita income. California’s 11th-place ranking in education gets it 10th in per capita income. And Texas? Texas ranks 29th in college graduates and 29th in per capita income, well below the national leaders.\n\nOur neighbor, Arkansas, ranks 49th in both education and income. Mississippi is 50th in income, a few notches below West Virginia, which is 50th in education. Imagine that: We are closer to Arkansas, Mississippi and West Virginia in educational attainment and income than we are to Massachusetts. I’ve got nothing against the Razorbacks, Ole Miss or the Mountaineers, but that is not where I want Texas to be.\n\nWhat does this have to do with the Dallas metroplex? Well, let me paint a picture for you. The Dallas–Fort Worth area is the country’s eighth-most-populous metropolitan region and its fifth-most economically productive. Texas ranks second in the nation in population, surpassed only by California.\n\nTexas has six public university systems. The University of Texas System is the granddaddy of them all, with 190,000 students in nine universities and six health institutions. Its flagship is UT Austin. The Texas A&M System has nine universities, with 103,000 students and a multicampus health science center. The remaining students are spread over the campuses of the Texas State University System, the University of North Texas System, the University of Houston System and the Texas Tech System. Stephen F. Austin, Midwestern State, Texas Southern and Texas Woman’s are independent public universities. All told, we have about 520,000 students attending the more than 40 public universities in our state.\n\nBy contrast, California has more than 600,000 students enrolled at just 33 public universities. The pinnacle of the state’s educational system is the University of California, with 209,000 students spread over 10 universities. The system includes some of the best universities in the world—UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC San Diego, UC Irvine, UC Davis and UC Santa Barbara.\n\nHow do our institutions of higher learning stack up against California and the rest of the nation? According to the latest U.S. News & World Report survey, UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC San Diego and UC Davis all outranked UT Austin for overall educational excellence. UC Irvine and UC Santa Barbara were tied with UT—at 44th. And the rest of our universities? Texas A&M fell two spots to 62nd, tied with Worcester Polytechnic in Massachusetts. Worcester Polytechnic. Ever heard of it? Southern Methodist University ranked 67th, Baylor University 75th and Texas Christian University 108th. Rice University came in 17th, right up there with Emory University and Johns Hopkins and above Berkeley and Notre Dame.\n\nImagine that! The “overtaxed, over-regulated, left-coast state” of California has within one fleet six universities that are ranked equal to or better than UT Austin, our top public university.\n\nNow let’s broaden our aperture a little by looking at membership in the Association of American Universities, regarded by most scholars as the imprimatur of the cream of the crop of research universities. The AAU is an exclusive group of the top 60 research universities in the United States. Those 60 U.S. schools garner about 60 percent of all federal R&D dollars and are home to 82 percent of all elected members of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine—the highest recognition in each of those fields. Since 1999, three-quarters of all Nobel Prizes were won by faculty members at those AAU universities. No doubt, everyone in this room would like to have many of our Texas universities included in this prestigious group.\n\nCalifornia has nine AAU members: UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC Davis, UC San Diego, UC Santa Barbara, UC Irvine, Caltech, Stanford and USC. Four of those are in the greater Los Angeles area alone. New York has seven: Columbia, Cornell, New York University, Syracuse, Stony Brook University, the University of Rochester and the University of Buffalo. (You actually should add an eighth by including Rutgers, which is within arm’s reach of New York City.)\n\nAnd within the 262,000 square miles of Texas? We have three: Rice, UT Austin and Texas A&M.\n\nThink about that. The great state of Texas—the state you and I love to brag and boast about, a state of 24 million people that has a glorious history second to none—has the same number of AAU member universities as the city of Boston. And Dallas, my hometown, has none. Dallas, the eighth-largest metropolitan area in America, doesn’t have a single top-ranked academic institution. We do have UT Southwestern Medical Center, a top-tier medical school, of course. But a medical school standing alone, no matter how good, is not enough in a world that is built on advanced technology and in-depth knowledge across many fields.\n\nWhen a university is a reputed fountainhead, the best and brightest minds flock to it and foundations, philanthropists and other agencies feel confident that their donations will be put to good use. I read a study published 10 years ago or so that found more than 4,000 companies had been started by alumni or faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Imagine how many more successful companies have been founded by MIT alumni in the decade since that study, a decade marked by the very sorts of high-tech innovations that many MIT grads are so well trained to master. It is little wonder that MIT attracts the highest-caliber students and teachers and substantial research funding.\n\nIncidentally, Texas Instruments was one of those MIT companies, whose founders also founded the predecessor to UT Dallas with the explicit aim of creating “the MIT of the Southwest.”\n\nCecil Green and Eugene McDermott and the other founders of UTD understood that the economic value generated by a university is tremendous. Universities earn some money from licensing out their patents, but the lion’s share of the economic boom comes from the people they educate, the ideas they cultivate, the companies they start and the research they do that spills out into the economy. More often than not, it is the university’s local community that most directly benefits from these overflows.\n\nMalcolm Gillis, a former member of the Dallas Fed board of directors and the immediate past president of Rice in Houston, shared with me an interesting fact about his university. A few years ago, he noticed that about 15 percent of undergrads were from local Harris County high schools, while nearly 33 percent of alumni lived in the county. In other words, bright and motivated people came to Houston because of the university and stayed for the job opportunities available to them upon graduation. Many of the jobs are in high-tech, knowledge-driven industries for which Rice and its alumni have laid the foundation.\n\nDallas does not have one university ranked in the top 60 by either U.S. News & World Report or the Association of American Universities. Our local university leaders—good men like Gerald Turner at SMU, David Daniel at UT Dallas, Kern Wildenthal at UT Southwestern, Victor Boschini at TCU and Jim Spaniolo at the University of Texas at Arlington—are fighting with one hand tied behind their backs. They need commitments and resources from the state and local community if they are to give this metropolitan area what California has in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, or in Los Angeles or San Diego or Santa Barbara, or what New York has in Manhattan, Rochester or Buffalo, or what Massachusetts has in Cambridge, and yes, even Worcester.\n\nHow can we expect Dallas and North Texas to prosper in the Knowledge Age—the era in which economic prosperity and wealth will be defined by cyberspace, nanotechnology, robotics and biology and mathematics-driven financial expertise—without at least one established fountainhead of advanced knowledge?\n\nWhen you leave this symposium today, I want you to look around Dallas’ cityscape. You won’t see factories with smokestacks and loading docks and noisy machines. Instead, you will see glass-and-steel buildings that warehouse the capital plant of the modern era: human brains. Brains that do research and provide services in medicine, marketing, finance and myriad other fields.\n\nTexas boomed with the discovery of vast petroleum deposits, first in the eastern part of the state, then in the west. Oil wells eventually run dry. An educated mind never does.\n\nTo be sure, we can fuel our local economy with graduates from California and Massachusetts and other states and countries—up to a point. But that is no substitute for Texas- and Dallas-bred intellectual talent, with its roots in the community and its commitment to building Big D.\n\nWe live in a globalized economy. Goods, services, money, ideas and people move across borders. How do we compete with the masses of Chinese and Indians and Eastern Europeans and Vietnamese and Mexicans and Latin Americans who will grow by making stuff so much cheaper than we can? How do we stay ahead of them as they continue up the value-added ladder into the service sector, into technology, into programming and into software and the sciences?\n\nHere’s how: We move even faster up the value-added ladder. How do we do that? By using our brains—what my father used to describe simply as “the little one-quart jar between your ears.”\n\nJust as farming and oil and gas and manufacturing once drove Texas’ economic development, an educated workforce with high earning potential will propel the future of our city, our state, our great nation and the world. The ultimate source of competitive advantage for Texas is not oil. It is not gas or the chemical industry. It is not even the Dallas Cowboys, even if they are America’s Team. Our ability to compete and thrive in the future—our ability to navigate into a prosperous future—will be determined by our elementary and secondary schools, our community colleges, our medical, law and engineering schools and research centers, and by our public and private universities. Education should be the highest priority of our community. It should be the most important priority of anybody who cares about the future of Dallas.\n\nThe North Dallas Chamber of Commerce knows how to sell. The people in this audience can sell better than anybody on the planet—you do it for a living. So do yourselves a favor. Go out and sell the fact that we need a world-class university, be it public or private, right here, right now. If you cannot use your considerable talent to do so, then woe is the future of our beloved city.",

            "content": "September 10, 2007 Laredo, Texas\n\nIt is an enormous pleasure to be back in Laredo. I spent a great deal of time here in 1993 and 1994, when I strayed from the path of righteousness and made a feeble run for the U.S. Senate. Wading into the cold and brackish waters of politics can be a gloomy experience, but there are rays of bright sunshine that provide a lifetime of warm memories. One of the brightest rays in my mercifully brief political career was Laredo.\n\nI recall most fondly the Washington's Birthday Celebration weekends. I loved it when the powers that be here selected Ann Richards as Mr. South Texas—a deft touch that showed Laredo manages to combine respect for tradition with a cutting-edge sense of modernity, and do it with sass en broma. And I loved the splendor and pageantry of the Colonial Ball, with all those beautiful young women in those magnificent and phenomenally expensive dresses.\n\nI am not the first and certainly won't be the last to be overwhelmed by the generosity of the big-hearted people of this dynamic border city, including that of our remarkable director from Laredo, Memo Trevino. I see many friendly faces here today, including Rosanne Palacios and Alberto and Lucy Cardenas, among so many others. Alberto and Lucy are the parents of Beto. Beto drove me around and traveled with me during my Senate campaign against Kay Bailey Hutchison. That was 13 years ago. Today, Beto works for Senator Hutchison, proof that time really does heal all wounds.\n\nHaving just mentioned the Colonial Ball, I can't help but single out the LaMantias. Steve and Linda have five precious girls. It was not for nothing that after the birth of Molly, the fifth daughter, Steve's dad, Joe, gave the family a dog named Boy. In the back of his mind, Papa Joe was likely discounting the future cost of five dresses for the Colonial Ball. And as true as my friendship is for the LaMantia family, he knew it would have been a bit much for me to argue for loosening monetary policy in order to accommodate outfitting those five LaMantia girls.\n\nI want to start today with a few observations about the U.S. economy before turning to the subject of Mexico and our border economy. I remind you that, as always, I speak only for myself and neither for the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—nor the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Current Predicament of the U.S. Economy\n\nIn recent weeks, we have heard much about financial market turbulence. We've been distracted by the noise of the subprime fallout, periodic reports of a \"seizing up\" in asset-backed commercial paper markets, volatility in the stock market and tremors in other parts of the financial infrastructure. (Apparently it is no longer true that, as Andrew Mellon once famously quipped, \"Gentlemen prefer bonds.\") Amidst this clamor and drama, some might have lost sight of our economy's great resiliency. In the first quarter of 2007, U.S. GDP rose despite sharp declines in housing and automobile production. Then second-quarter growth rebounded to a 4 percent annual rate, which is considerable for a $13 trillion economy; in the second quarter alone, Americans produced $130 billion in incremental output. Much of the renewed strength came from net exports benefiting from a still-growing, historically dynamic global economy, a reminder that our flexible, highly diverse economy has many sources of growth. With a solid second quarter and low unemployment, the U.S. economy entered the second half of the year with good forward momentum. Given the financial turmoil that began last month, I am generally encouraged by what I have heard and seen so far: As yet, tighter credit conditions do not appear to have had a major impact on overall economic activity outside of real estate.\n\nAs we approach the upcoming session of the FOMC, each of the participants, including me, is diving deep into the data and taking soundings from business leaders, bankers and others with operating ears to the ground to ascertain the current pace of the economy and—this is important—the prospective dynamics of growth and inflation. I am particularly active on this front. Before each meeting, I speak with around 30 CEOs and CFOs of a careful selection of large and small companies from around the country in order to get an in-depth understanding of the pace of economic growth and price pressures they see through their businesses. Meanwhile, our staff routinely surveys a broad base of businesses within our district and reports their findings in what is known as the Beige Book, the most recent of which was released last Wednesday. Lately, I have focused on how recent developments in financial markets are impacting the revenues and costs, supplier and customer dynamics, product mix and growth projections of these hands-on operators of our economy. I am only partway along in studying the entrails of the Beige Book and a third of the way through my CEO and CFO conversations and have not yet reached any conclusions. However, it is fair to say that I am encouraged by what I have heard against a background of constant negative speculation and the occasional discordant note, such as last week's employment numbers. Our economy appears to be weathering the storm thus far. The future path of that storm and the appropriate policy course, however, are still to be determined.\n\nAt a recent Jackson Hole retreat for central bankers and economists, Ned Gramlich, a much-revered and very wise former Fed governor who sadly succumbed to leukemia on Wednesday, reminded us in a speech that America's economic progress has been punctuated with booms and busts. The 19th century had its canal, railroad and mineral booms. The 20th century had its rushes of financial innovation and new technology. Each boom was followed by a collapse when prices could no longer keep up. \"When the dust clears,\" Gramlich wrote, \"there is financial carnage, many investors learning to be more careful next time, but there are often the fruits of the boom still around to benefit productivity…. The canals and railroads are still there and functional, the minerals are discovered and in use, the financing innovations stay and we still have the Internet and all its capabilities.\" The fruits of the subprime market boom, he reminded us, are the millions of low-income and minority borrowers who now own their own homes and are successfully making their payments and building equity for the future.\n\nKeep this in mind as the housing market corrects and the new financial instruments spawned by the housing boom and turbocharged financial technology continue seeking more rational price levels—levels that will be determined not by ersatz valuation models and unsustainable return assumptions, but by the market's discipline in equilibrating supply and demand. A great many families who would never have had access to the ultimate fruit of the American harvest—homeownership—were able to achieve that dream because of the housing boom.\n\nAnd what about the \"bust\" side of the equation, what Gramlich referred to as the \"financial carnage\"? I managed a hedge fund for 10 years before selling my interests in 1997, as I wound up a banking and asset-management career that had started in 1975. I know from experience that markets are manic-depressive, subject to enormous mood swings. They overshoot on the upside in periods of enthusiasm and on the downside when reality sets in. During the inevitable corrections, there are always cries of anguish—and no paucity of self-serving policy recommendations—from financial market operators who exploited a boom and then let complacency or greed get the better of their judgment. Reward is commensurate with risk, and risk is a double-edged sword. I do not believe the Federal Reserve's job is to protect specific risk takers who failed to protect themselves from potential downside wounds. The Federal Reserve's job is to protect the system itself. My colleagues and I take that responsibility very seriously.\n\nPeople always ask what guides me when I sit at the Federal Open Market Committee table. The FOMC is a deliberative body, and monetary policy is a judgmental business in the end. It is a complex and serious business. To live up to what is expected of us, we have to make considered judgments and not react to the latest data point or the \"instant analysis\" that is ubiquitous on the Internet or in the news media or among the countless financial analysts who pump out commentary like water from a fire hydrant. \"Instant analysis\" is a wonderful oxymoron—a true contradiction in terms, like \"jumbo shrimp\" or \"funny economist\"—but hardly the stuff of serious deliberation.\n\nWhat guides me at the table is pretty straightforward. One of my four children is here today, my son Miles. Whenever I sit at the FOMC table, I am mindful that the entire transcript of our deliberations will be released in five years. I think about what Miles and his brother and sisters will think when they read their father's words in a historical context, removed from whatever the press and the markets may be clamoring about at the time of the meeting. I am guided first and foremost by a desire for my children to be proud of their dad; to be judged by them as well as by economic historians as having been wise rather than too smart by half, as having a steady hand rather than an itchy trigger finger. I set aside the passions of the moment and the conventional wisdom in the markets and keep a steady focus on the Fed's mission: to conduct monetary policy so as to achieve long-term, noninflationary economic growth for the great capitalist machine that is the United States of America. Conducting monetary policy is not a popularity contest.\n\nAll of this is a long way of saying that, in my humble opinion, the standard tools of monetary policy are insufficient, by themselves, to deal with the subprime market fallout. The best course, as Ned Gramlich reminded us, is to minimize the future threat to the economy while taking care not to strangle financial innovation and its benefits. He reckoned that over half the subprime mortgage loans in recent years were made by independent lenders who were not subject to federal supervision. Virtually all prime market loans, by contrast, are made by federally supervised banks and thrifts or their affiliates. Gramlich pointed out that \"[i]n the prime market, where we need supervision less, we have lots of it,\" whereas \"in the subprime market, where we badly need supervision, a majority of loans are made with very little supervision.\"\n\nMy guess is that a great deal of the potential dislocation resulting from corrective reactions to the subprime boom will be resolved by regulatory initiatives rather than by monetary policy. Yet it is important to remember that regulatory reforms are like a vaccine—better at preventing sickness than at curing it. Much of the solution for the current pathology lies in the curative workings of the financial markets. I suspect the markets will be unsparing in their treatment of the most egregious of those who engaged in risky financial behavior. There is little that regulation can or should do to interfere with letting that treatment run its course.\n\nAny new regulations that might now be crafted to prevent future recurrences must be well thought out, for two reasons. First, financial institutions will quickly adapt to defeat any regulation that is poorly designed, morphing into new, vaccine-resistant strains. Second, heavy-handed regulations are sometimes worse than the disease against which they are meant to protect. I would be wary of any regulatory initiatives that interfere with market discipline and attempts to protect risk takers from the consequences of bad decisions for fear of creating a moral hazard that might endanger the long-term health of our economic and financial system simply to provide momentary relief.\n\nOn that happy note, I want to shift the focus of my remarks today and comment on the U.S.–Mexico economic relationship.\n\nThe Mexican Economy\n\nHere on the Texas–Mexico border, you are used to paying as much attention to Mexico as the U.S. I do, too, in no small part because of my personal history. The country provided refuge to my immigrant parents between 1939 and 1947 as they waited to become U.S. citizens. Two years after I was born in Los Angeles, we were off to Mexico City, where I was educated through primary school and developed a love for all things Mexican. Apart from my sentimental childhood attachment, my economic perspective on Mexico was forged in part by the four years I spent as deputy U.S. trade representative in the Clinton administration, negotiating with Mexico on the implementation of NAFTA. Back then, the official coordination of infrastructure issues, regulations and other policies needed to maximize the gains from free trade was done between the nations' capitals. But I never forgot that the cities and towns along the border, from the mouth of the Rio Grande to San Diego's beaches, were, and continue to be, ground zero for the economic integration of Mexico and the U.S.\n\nI like to say that Mexico and the United States are joined at the hip, especially when it comes to the two nations' economies. Three-fifths of Mexico's imports, most of which are manufactured goods, are from the U.S., and two-thirds of all foreign direct investment into Mexico comes from U.S. investors. More than 90 percent of Mexico's exports are destined for the United States. Mexican workers provide a significant part of the economic muscle that makes the U.S. economy so mighty, and Mexico is a critical part of our industrial base, feeding the supply lines of American businesses. It is, therefore, vitally important for the Dallas Fed to keep a watchful eye on the economic goings-on of its southern neighbor.\n\nWhat are we seeing across the border?\n\nDespite healthy internal consumer demand supported by much-improved credit conditions, we see a Mexican economy experiencing slower growth this year, largely due to a slowdown in U.S. manufacturing and a weak first quarter. Mexico's second-quarter GDP growth picked up, however, and the rest of this year is expected to bring faster overall growth although a slowing in U.S. manufacturing, fallout from the credit markets situation or other factors such as less foreign direct investment and further weakness in remittances could upset the more optimistic forecasts for the Mexican economy during the rest of 2007.\n\nRecent price developments could dampen prospects as well. Consumer price inflation has been slightly above Banco de México's target range for a few months because of a run-up in commodity and food prices. However, Mexican inflation has been at historic lows in recent years, which continues to benefit workers and consumers. Inflation is an onerous tax and a disincentive to work, save and invest. In an economy plagued by rising prices, a dollar saved ends up a quarter earned, a fact that does not change if you deal in pesos and centavos. Thankfully, the Mexican economy continues to benefit under the superb leadership of Guillermo Ortíz at Banco de México. The central bank has elected to stand pat since April, anticipating that inflation is on a slow downward trend. Nevertheless, prices spiked in July, and inflation expectations among economic and financial agents may be a bit too high.\n\nShort-term obstacles, however, are not Mexico's foremost concern. Much more worrisome is the fact that long-term growth remains hampered by persistent structural impediments. And yet the Banco de México, having used its constitutionally guaranteed independence to subdue distracting inflationary impulses and peso devaluations, has liberated President Calderón's government and the Mexican Congress to finally deal with these vexing issues.\n\nInvestments in education are beginning to pay off, but schooling is still inadequate in many parts of the country. Property rights aren't enforced as well as they should be, creating difficulties for lending and investing. The sprawling informal sector that employs more than 20 million people—from low-skilled workers to entrepreneurs discouraged by the formal sector's burdensome regulations and taxes—creates significant inefficiency. Widespread tax evasion limits Mexico's ability to raise revenue, a hurdle for needed investment in education and infrastructure. In the energy sector, production and distribution are under government control and, given Mexico's limited fiscal resources, future oil-producing capacity is a cause for concern.\n\nThe obstacles I've just enumerated are well documented and well understood by Mexican authorities. There is no need for me to dwell on them today. It is important to emphasize the tremendous progress the country has made over the past two decades in several key areas. Mexico embraced free trade in the mid-1980s and strengthened its economic roots with its northern neighbors and got its fiscal and monetary affairs in order in the 1990s. Since then, the transformation has been remarkable. Mexico has become an open economy with a steadfast dedication to policy discipline and macroeconomic stability. Gone are the days when election-year turmoil invariably brought Mexico's economy to its knees.\n\nAnother interesting development is in Mexican financial markets. Hard-earned macroeconomic stability has brought momentous change to Mexico's once-backward financial services sector, giving birth to a dynamic industry that, after a slow start, now offers a full menu of banking and investment services and increasing lending capacity. Mexican and Spanish banks are even buying banks in Texas and other U.S. border states to tap the large and growing Mexican population living on both sides and cater to their demand for dollar-denominated accounts and other specialized services.\n\nThe next frontier for Mexico is the implementation of structural reforms. There is much debate over just what the reforms should look like. Difficult as the process may be, Mexico must redouble its efforts to implement needed reforms.\n\nMexico and Texas\n\nA few moments ago, I used the image of the U.S. and Mexico being joined at the hip. If so, that makes Texas the hipbone that connects them. The border economy is unique. The combination of maquiladoras, agriculture, cross-border trade and the region's binational labor pool has let the Rio Grande Valley, Laredo and El Paso enjoy solid growth, even during slowdowns elsewhere in the U.S. and Mexico. Texas' border cities have one foot in Mexico and one foot in the U.S., with growth linked to economic conditions on both sides. The close ties to Mexico have allowed Brownsville, McAllen and Laredo to rank among the country's fastest-growing areas since 1990 in terms of population and jobs, and border unemployment rates have dropped to record lows. A large and rapidly growing labor force and low education levels, however, have meant that border wages have remained low relative to the national average. Still, there are signs of improvement. Since 2000, average wages on the border have outpaced state and U.S. wage growth. And in 2006, median hourly wages increased faster in the Rio Grande Valley than in the state or the nation.\n\nMaquiladoras and trade-related transportation infrastructure have long been engines of economic growth along both sides of the border. Export-related manufacturers on the Mexican side have gained steadily, drawing on a constant stream of migrating workers from southern Mexico and complementary component and material suppliers on the U.S. side. While the emphasis is still industrial on the Mexican side, the U.S. side is a services economy, with retail and health care making significant gains in jobs and activity here in South Texas. Why? Job growth and a strong peso have improved the purchasing power of the Mexican consumer. Texas' proximity to Monterrey, Mexico's second wealthiest city, and prosperous maquiladoras along the border have also meant an increase in shopping trips to Texas. This is not news to anyone in this room. Between 1978 and 2001, Mexican nationals accounted for an estimated 53 percent of Laredo's retail sales.\n\nA positive development along the border has been an explosion in its health care industry over the past 10 years. Like retail and banking, health care is a service that is in demand by Mexican nationals and by the burgeoning population of U.S. retirees in Mexico. Hospitals and home health care agencies are expanding at rapid rates and, along with growth in education and federal government jobs in Border Patrol and Customs, are providing high-paying employment to border residents.\n\nWhile almost all Texas border cities have deep ties with Mexico, their linkages can be quite different, and their economies respond accordingly to changing conditions in Mexico. Our research has found that, typically, sharp declines in the peso result in economic downturns in Laredo, McAllen and Brownsville. Each has retail sectors that depend heavily on Mexican shoppers, so swings in the peso can have big impacts. The strong and stable peso—thanks to the 1994 constitutional reform that gave Banco de México the independence it has so ably applied in recent years—is a big piece of the puzzle that explains robust growth in Laredo and the Valley.\n\nThe outlook continues to be favorable for border population and job growth, both in Texas and the states to our west. Real progress, however, will require greater productivity and increased wages. The ultimate source of income growth and prosperity originates with human capacity and education, the development of which should be the highest priority of this community. It should be the highest priority of this state.\n\nEducation and Immigrants\n\nWe never know enough in today's world and must embrace lifetime learning to achieve the American Dream. Our chief economist at the Dallas Fed, Mike Cox, likes to say, \"You earn what you learn.\" The U.S. economy today is far different from the one that employed our parents and grandparents in the fields and factories. Agriculture represents 2 percent of our national economy. Manufacturing employs only 11 percent of our workforce. Construction and mining represent 5 percent. Eighty-two percent of American workers are employed in services, a sprawling sector that includes some of the nation's most prestigious and highest-paying jobs.\n\nMy friend Stanley Fischer, governor of the Bank of Israel, once quipped that \"there are three kinds of economists: those who can count and those who can't.\" Yet even mathematically challenged economists are united on this: Education pays off. There is an irrefutable positive link between education and income. Wages are low on the border because education levels are low. We see this link across states, across countries, between individuals and in America's progress over time.\n\nSpending on education is an investment in our children. But that takes time, and we in Texas and the U.S. have meanwhile added to our intellectual capital in another way. We import educated workers from other countries and do what we can to retain foreign students who come to study here. Along the U.S.–Mexico border, you know this well. Throughout its history, the region has benefited from tapping the human capital of northern Mexico's border states, which have some of Mexico's finest universities.\n\nLet me give you an example of the \"you earn what you learn\" principle from our San Antonio branch board of directors. To do so, I am going to embarrass Dr. G. P. Singh, who is an American success story, combining education with entrepreneurship. As a boy in his native India, G. P. studied diligently, earning a spot in the Punjab Engineering College. Like so many foreigners, he continued his education in the U.S., earning a doctorate at Drexel University. In time, Dr. Singh came to San Antonio and started his own engineering business—Karta Technologies—a company he just sold for a cool $65 million.\n \nDr. Singh's is a perfect example of how immigrant-founded firms are furthering the technological prowess of the U.S. economy. According to a recent study by researchers at Duke University and UC Berkeley, immigrants were listed as inventors or co-inventors on 24 percent of all U.S. patent applications in 2006, up from only 7 percent in 1998. Of all the science and technology companies established in the United States between 1995 and 2005, 25 percent had at least one foreign-born founder.\n\nMost important, G. P. is a case study of how to convert learning to earning and how to harness the brain to create economic prosperity. We must foster conditions that allow a child from Laredo—or from any other city in Texas or the U.S. or from Mexico City or Nuevo Laredo or from Punjab in faraway India—to succeed in the economic promised land called America. With a well-educated workforce, no market correction, no interruption of the orderly working of financial markets and no apocryphal prognostication of the \"instant analysts\" or even of humorless economists can dislodge us from our position as the world's mightiest economic machine.\n\nWith that, I will end today's sermon.\n\nAnd now in keeping with Federal Reserve tradition, I would be happy to not answer any questions you might have.\n\nAndamos, pues. Thank you.",

            "content": "August 25, 2007 Biloxi, Mississippi\n\nThank you, Governor Barbour. I was rather enjoying your introduction until you mentioned the 1994 Senate race, a misguided adventure from a previous life. We at the Fed are sticklers for accurate data, so I need to issue a correction: I received 1,639,615 votes in 1994, which computes to 38.309 percent—roughly. About the only thing I was able to accomplish in that race was eating a dipped cone in every Dairy Queen in the Lone Star State—all 700-plus of them. Texas ended up with a fine senator in Kay Hutchison and, despite all those ice cream cones and Hunger-Busters, I managed to shed 20 pounds. It was a win–win experience. At least that's my story and I'm sticking to it.\n \nYou all know that we at the Fed are nonpartisan. Once you enter the \"Temple,\" as some call it, you check your politics at the door. I joined up a couple of years ago and, like all Fed presidents, have refrained from political commentary since crossing that threshold. But I think it right and proper to say that what you have done here, Governor, in Biloxi and throughout Mississippi in the aftermath of Katrina's fury is impressive. I am honored to have been introduced by you and to meet with the Southern Governors' Association.\n\nMy district covers Texas, 26 parishes in Governor Blanco's state and 18 counties in New Mexico. It is a productive district, just like those covered by the Atlanta Fed and the St. Louis Fed—by Dennis's [Lockhart] and Bill's [Poole] banks—and the Richmond, Cleveland and Kansas City Feds, all of which have portions of the Greater South in their districts but are not represented here today. The governors of the Southern states, along with Dennis and Bill and me, with Jeff Lacker in Richmond, Sandy Pianalto in Cleveland and Tom Hoenig in Kansas City, serve a mighty swath of the U.S. economy. The American public reads almost daily about the great economic power rising on the far side of the Pacific. Well, you might remind your constituents and the press every now and then that the 16 states that you govern and that my colleagues and I serve, all told, produce a combined output that is 76 percent greater than China's. Let me do the calculation in a different way: For every dollar's worth of output that China produces, the hardworking constituents of your states produce $1.76. The South is an economic juggernaut.\n\nHow do we keep growing this mighty economic force? How does the South stay ahead of China and India and all the others who are knocking at the door, wanting economic prosperity?\n\nFirst, we must acknowledge that we live in a cyber-enhanced, interconnected, inextricably interdependent global economy. The Southern economy is no longer confined by lines drawn on a map; it is no more removed from countries and markets at the far ends of the Earth than it is from the rest of the United States. We live in a globalized economy, knitted together by Knowledge Age technologies. Until the Industrial Revolution, economies were largely local, confined mostly to cities and towns. The butcher, the baker and the candlestick maker were within a day's walk or horseback ride. Then came railroads, industry, telephones, cars, highways, television and the Internet. With each successive technological innovation, our economic activities expanded beyond our towns and states and regions, allowing us more choices in determining our destinies and bringing more difficulties in devising local and regional government economic policies. Sir Anthony Eden, the prime minister who succeeded Winston Churchill, said to the House of Commons in 1945, \"Every succeeding scientific discovery makes greater nonsense of old-time conceptions of sovereignty.\" He was dead-on.\n\nWhat happens around the world affects us in the Southern states, just as what happens in each of your states influences investment decisions and economic activity around the world. We all know how devastating a fierce hurricane can be at the local level, destroying homes and businesses and disrupting millions of lives. Dislocations caused by a storm in the U.S. ripple around the globe: The Gulf's vast oil and gas activity shuts down, causing world energy prices to rise and leaving drivers in Boston, Bulgaria and Brazil with less money in their pockets.\n\nWhen a Mississippi manufacturing company closes its Gulfport factory and moves it to Guangdong, China, in pursuit of lowering its costs, it hurts. The press, with its local emphasis, focuses on the downside. And you, as governors, feel the brunt of your citizens' anger. And yet you know and I know that Chinese workers at that new factory many thousands of miles from here now make more money than they did before. As they grow more prosperous, the Chinese can afford to consume more, and so they start spending their hard-earned yuan at the neighborhood Wal-Mart—good news for Governor Beebe—or on bottles of Jack Daniel's—good news for Governor Bredesen—or perhaps on once-in-a-lifetime vacations to Disney World—good news for Governor Crist—or on soybeans grown in Texas—good news for my friend Governor Perry, who is well aware that China is one of the fastest-growing destinations for shipments leaving Houston's port. So intertwined are the world's economies that disentangling the web would be, as Bill Poole just pointed out, disastrously expensive, counterproductive and entirely fruitless. It takes extraordinary political leadership to accommodate globalization.\n\nOver the decades, the inexorable march of capitalist evolution has shifted our economy's base from agriculture to manufacturing and now to services. This is important to understand as we contemplate the South's future. As people get richer, they shift their spending away from goods and toward services. For every dollar Americans spend on goods, we spend $1.70 on services. Ours is not a goods-based economy anymore—we grow and ship to the world a veritable cornucopia of crops, but agriculture represents only 1.5 percent of our economy. We build at a furious pace and mine our rich store of natural resources, but construction and mining represent only 5.5 percent of our economy. We are a manufacturing powerhouse, and yet factory output represents only around 11 percent of our economy. Services account for 82 percent of our economic output. Let me repeat that: 82 percent of our economic output comes from the service sector.\n\nGiven your professional background, Mr. Chairman, you may be interested in one fact that illustrates the importance of the service sector: At the end of 2005, the U.S. auto and auto parts manufacturing industry employed about 1.1 million workers and added 0.8 percent to our GDP. The legal services sector had nearly the same workforce—a little over a million lawyers inhabit America—but they contributed 1.5 percent to GDP. Lawyers produce twice as much as automobile workers. So much for lawyer jokes.\n\nObviously, services differ from goods in the job skills they require. Physical strength and manual dexterity, workers' primary input for so much of what was produced in the agricultural and manufacturing eras, have been replaced by creativity, reasoning and emotional intelligence. We prosper by the work of our brow, not the labor of our muscle. The capital stock of our modern economy is not our buildings or our factories or our farms. It is our brains. It is our ability to think of new ideas, inventions and solutions. It is our commitment to customer service at this fine resort and millions of other places. It is our designs for new buildings, new computers or a space module. It manifests itself in new financing products or medical breakthroughs or the entertainment industry.\n\nThe great economist Joseph Schumpeter coined the term creative destruction. This seemingly contradictory phrase comes, by the way, from an economist who had a knack for the clever quip. One of our former Fed governors, Dewey Daane, is a constituent of Governor Bredesen. He lives up there in Nashville. As a Harvard student back in the 1940s, he was taught by Schumpeter. He reports that the first day of class, Schumpeter walked in the room and said: \"When I was young, I wanted to be the greatest economist in the world, the world's greatest lover and the best horseman on earth. I have not done well with the horses.\"\n\nIn his pursuit of the first of those three grand goals, Professor Schumpeter wrote that \"stabilized capitalism is a contradiction in terms.\" He was right: Capitalism is far from stable, and it is never dull. It is constantly transforming the economic landscape. And the American genius has time and again mastered that transformation—rather than be victimized by it.\n\nThe destructive side of capitalism's creative destruction is evident in lost jobs. Let me share a few numbers for the states you govern. The number of workers in apparel manufacturing in your states decreased 80 percent between 1990 and 2005. In the same 15-year period, payrolls fell 18 percent at paper manufacturers and 15 percent for furniture makers. The number of farm workers decreased 6 percent, and the number of mine workers declined 5 percent. That is pretty painful stuff. And it is not ancient history. It all occurred within a time frame that is fresh in the memory of everyone in this room—between 1990 and 2005.\n\nAnd yet, despite these employment losses, each state in the Southern region now has a larger job base than it did in 1990. North Carolina, for example, has created 1 million net new jobs since 1990. Texas' employment has risen by more than 3 million since 1990.\n\nWhy? Because the creative side of creative destruction outpaced the destructive side. Your economies replaced lost jobs in declining sectors with new ones in emerging, higher-value-added sectors. Between 1990 and 2005, the number of data processing and Internet service provider workers in Southern states increased 65 percent. Professional services workers grew 63 percent. Financial services employees increased 31 percent. Retail employment grew 23 percent. By 2005, the financial and real estate services sectors employed as many Southern workers as the manufacturing sector. Lodging and food services accounted for the same share of the Southern workforce as construction.\n\nHealth care sector employment in the South alone grew by 2.3 million from 1990 to 2005. Let me put that in perspective: For every manufacturing job lost in the Southern states between 1990 and 2005, the health care sector created 2.4 new jobs.\n\nYes, we are losing jobs in the goods-producing parts of the economy to faraway lands. But we are gaining them in the service sector and net—net—we are creating more jobs than we are losing.\n\nA good friend of mine, Dr. Jonathan Weissler, is chief of medicine and holds the chair in pulmonary research at the University of Texas Southwestern University Hospitals in my hometown of Dallas. We have coffee together in the mornings at our local Starbucks—come to think of it, another globalized service provider.\n\nAfter we have our coffee, Dr. Weissler goes to his office where, like most doctors, he examines patients and then dictates notes into a recorder. The recording is transcribed into the patient's file. There is nothing startling there; this has been standard medical practice for decades. What is new—and what is fast becoming a hallmark of the globalizing economy—is that he no longer pays an on-site employee in Dallas to transcribe his dictation. Instead, Dr. Weissler simply clicks a mouse and sends the recording to a company that farms the transcribing work out to English speakers around the world. While Dr. Weissler sleeps, the notes are typed up overnight in Bangalore for a fraction of the cost and arrive on the good doctor's desktop by morning.\n\nIncidentally, Dr. Weissler says he can tell when the transcripts are produced in India because the English is perfect and even the most complex medical terms are spelled correctly—a testimony to India's teaching of proper English in their schools.\n\nBy reducing costs and streamlining his recordkeeping in this way, Dr. Weissler's practice runs more efficiently and his staff can devote more time to serving patients and growing his practice. The real payoff is that money saved in offshoring transcription can be reinvested into researching new ways to save and improve American lives.\n\nDr. Weissler is harnessing and harvesting globalization. What makes this possible? Cyberspace and globalization. The Net and fiber-optic cable give him the ability to access, coordinate, manage and control resources around the world without regard to distance, borders or time zones.\n\nThere are counterparts to Dr. Weissler in every one of your states. As globalization continues and the world economy evolves, more creative destruction will impact your states. That is the bad news because job destruction creates political pressures for transition programs at best and protectionist or retaliatory responses at worst. The good news is that the creative side of this inexorable phenomenon, properly managed, results in better jobs, higher living standards, lower prices and increased prosperity.\n\nI echo Bill Poole's message: The answer is not protectionism. Rather than labor fruitlessly to protect your constituents from foreign competition, you and your legislatures must prepare them for it. Use your extraordinary talents as leaders to provide the transition mechanisms that will enable them to retool and move up the value-added ladder into higher-paying jobs.\n\nThere is no great secret about how to lay the groundwork for Southern states' success in harvesting and harnessing—in mastering—globalization. The key to adapting to and profiting from globalization lies in education. Texas boomed on the discovery of oil. Now we thrive on the output of the human mind. If you look around Dallas and Houston, you see office buildings, not oil wells or factories. Those buildings warehouse the capital plant of the modern era: human brains. Brains that research and provide services in medicine, marketing, finance and myriad other services. Oil wells eventually run dry. An educated mind never does.\n\nJust as farming and oil and gas and manufacturing once propelled the development of the Southern states, an educated workforce with high earning potential will propel the future of your states, our great nation and the world. The ultimate source of competitive advantage for Texas is not oil and gas or the chemical industry or this widget or that or even the Dallas Cowboys or the San Antonio Spurs (even if they are the good Lord's favorite teams)—it is our elementary and secondary schools, and the University of Texas at Austin, Texas A&M in College Station, Rice University in Houston, Southwestern Medical and Southern Methodist University in Dallas, and our law and engineering schools and research centers. Each of you could say that for your states. The development of human capacity through education should be the highest policy priority of any government in the South or anywhere else.\n\nWhen I ran for the Senate, I was told to make every effort to condense complex thoughts and ideas into simple catchall phrases. I obviously wasn't very good at it. And, as politicians yourselves, you know meaningful brevity is not an easy task. Nor one that everyone appreciates. Pundits deride the catchy line as \"bumper sticker\" politics. I am not running for anything, so I'll risk offering a bumper sticker for our times, one delivering this simple message: \"You earn what you learn.\"\n\nAs I said at the outset, the South is a mighty economic machine. To remain powerful and prosperous, we need to move faster and farther up the educational ladder. The Chinese and the Indians and the Vietnamese and Eastern Europeans and Latin Americans are taking possession of the lower rungs of the world economy. There are 3 billion or more fervent wannabe capitalists among them who want to be rich like us. We cannot stop them, nor should we bother trying. But we must stay ahead of them. The key to doing so lies in developing our citizens' brainpower. The human brain is the capital plant of the Knowledge Age. Education is the fuel for that plant. The living standards of your constituents will be determined by what they learn. So my best advice for you as governors is to throw your weight and your budget dollars behind education. It is an investment that provides unlimited returns. It is an investment that will secure our economic future.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "June 13, 2007 Dallas, Texas\n\nI love speaking to Rotarians, especially the Downtown Rotary. I was a member of this wonderful club before I went off to serve in Washington in 1997. I loved every minute of it, especially the patriotism and the esprit de corps. I have always considered Rotarians the Marine Corps of the civic community. Remember what Ronald Reagan said about the Marines? “Some people spend an entire lifetime wondering if they have made a difference. The Marines don't have that problem.”\n\nNeither do Rotarians. You have taken Paul Harris' vision and expanded upon and realized it, making every community in America better for it.\n\nI also love the Rotarian sense of humor. When I was a member, Carol Reed used to read the “news” to us at the beginning of every meeting here at Downtown Rotary. One of my all-time favorites was about a man who had fallen into a river in Egypt and had managed to fight off an attack by a crocodile. The punch line, of course, was that if you didn't believe a man could fend off a croc with his bare hands, then you yourself were in “de-Nile.”\n\nToday, I want to talk about another kind of denial. I am not going to talk about the economy or monetary policy or interest rates. We can do that in the question-and-answer period after this sermon, if you wish. What I want to talk about is higher education. I want to focus on the tendency of Dallas to deny that we are getting the short end of the stick when it comes to producing the academic and intellectual excellence needed to make Dallas the great city we all want it to be.\n\nI have deliberately picked the Downtown Rotary Club to convey this message. Rotarians have a long history of commitment to educational excellence, which has benefited countless communities in the U.S. and around the world. And, incidentally, it directly benefited the Federal Reserve. Paul Volcker, the Zeus of central banking gods, the man who pulled this country back from the brink of economic catastrophe, studied at the London School of Economics as a Rotary Scholar. I always speak for myself and for no other official of the Federal Reserve System. Today is no exception. But I think I am safe in saying the entire Federal Reserve holds Rotary in the highest regard. We thank you for what you care about and what you do.\n\nI know that you care about education. I know that you do so much for Dallas. So let me get to the point.\n\nDallas–Fort Worth is the eighth-most-populous metropolitan area in the country and the fifth-most economically productive. Texas ranks second in the nation in population and productivity, surpassed on both fronts only by California.\n\nTexas has six public university systems. The University of Texas System is the granddaddy of them all, with 190,000 students in nine universities and six health institutions. The Texas A&M System has nine universities with 103,000 students and a multicampus health science center. The remaining students are spread over the campuses of the Texas State University System, the University of North Texas System, the University of Houston System and the Texas Tech System. Stephen F. Austin, Midwestern State, Texas Southern and Texas Woman's are each independent public universities. All told, we have about 520,000 students attending the more than 40 public universities in our state.\n\nBy contrast, California has more than 600,000 students enrolled at just 33 public universities. The granddaddy of that state educational system is the University of California, with 209,000 students spread over 10 universities.\n\nHow many people in this room think that Berkeley is the only center of excellence in the University of California System? Not a one of you. And that is because you know that in addition to Berkeley, the University of California System has UCLA, UC San Diego, UC Irvine, UC Davis and UC Santa Barbara.\n\nNow here is a fact. According to the latest U.S. News & World Report survey, Berkeley, UCLA, UC San Diego and UC Irvine all outranked UT Austin for overall educational excellence. UC Davis and UC Santa Barbara were tied with UT—at 47th. And the rest of our universities? Texas A&M was ranked 60th. SMU ranked 70th, Baylor 81st and TCU 105th. Rice was ranked 17th, right up there with Johns Hopkins and Vanderbilt and above Berkeley.\n\nHold that thought: The “overtaxed, over-regulated, left-coast state” of California has within one fleet six universities that are ranked equal to or better than UT Austin, our flagship.\n\nNow let's broaden our aperture a little by looking at membership in the Association of American Universities, which is regarded by most scholars as the definition of the cream of the crop of research universities. The AAU consists of 60 U.S. and two Canadian universities. These 60 U.S. schools garner about 60 percent of all federal R&D dollars; they are home to 82 percent of all elected members of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine—the highest recognition in each of those fields. Since 1999, three quarters—74 percent—of all Nobel Prizes were won by individuals who were faculty members at AAU universities. It is fair to say that everyone in this room would like to have our Texas universities included in this prestigious group of 60.\n\nCalifornia has nine AAU members: UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC Davis, UC San Diego, UC Santa Barbara, UC Irvine, Caltech, Stanford and USC. Four of those are in the greater Los Angeles area alone.\n\nNew York has seven: Columbia, Cornell, New York University, Syracuse, Stony Brook University, the University of Rochester and the University of Buffalo. You actually should add an eighth by including Rutgers, which is within arm's reach of New York City.\n\nAnd Texas? We have three: Rice, UT Austin and Texas A&M.\n\nThink about that. The great state of Texas—the state I love to brag and boast about; a state of 24 million people that has a glorious history second to none—has the same number of AAU member universities as the city of Boston. And Dallas, my hometown, has none. Zip. Zero. Nada. Dallas, the eighth-largest metropolitan area in America, doesn't have a single top-ranked academic institution. We do have UT Southwestern, a top-tier medical school, of course. But a medical school standing alone, no matter how good, is not enough in a world that is built on advanced technology and in-depth knowledge across many fields.\n\nHow can we expect to navigate our way into the economic future without a single elite university in our city? How can we expect Dallas to prosper in the Knowledge Age—the era in which economic prosperity and wealth will be defined by cyberspace, nanotechnology, robotics and biology, and mathematics-driven financial expertise—without at least one established fountainhead of advanced knowledge?\n\nOn Sunday, Tom Friedman of The New York Times reported an interesting observation by Lucien Bronicki. An expert in geothermal energy in the Negev Desert, Bronicki met with Friedman at an Israeli university. Pointing to a roomful of students studying biomedical engineering, software development, electrical engineering and computing, Bronicki remarked: “These are our oil wells.” And Friedman added: “These are oil wells that don't run dry.”\n\nEconomists may quibble about widgets and whatnot, but they are united on this: Education pays off. There's an irrefutable positive link between education and income. We see it across countries, between individuals, in America's progress over time and when comparing states. Little old Massachusetts, for example, with a third-place ranking in college graduates per capita, has lifted itself up to first in per capita income. California's 11th-place ranking in education gets it 10th in per capita income. Texas ranks 29th in college graduates and 29th in per capita income, well below the national leaders in college-educated workers and earnings. Our neighbor, Arkansas, ranks 49th in both.\n\nMississippi is 50th in income, competing with West Virginia, which is 50th in education. Imagine that: We are closer to Arkansas in educational attainment and income than we are to Massachusetts. I've got nothing against Razorbacks, Ole Miss or the Mountaineers, but that is not where I want Texas to be.\n\nWhen we leave this luncheon today, I want you to look around Dallas' cityscape. Tell me how many factories you see. You won't see any—at least not any of the old-fashioned kind with smokestacks and loading docks and noisy machines. Instead, you will see glass and steel buildings that house the machines and the capital stock of the modern economy: human brains. The brain is to the Knowledge Age what the motor was to the Industrial Age. And education is the oil, the fuel that drives the knowledge economy forward.\n\nLately, we have been cooing and aahing over the Barnett Shale. We brag about the drilling rigs that are popping up all around D/FW Airport. All that is great. We need all the homegrown gas production we can get. But when was the last time the public attention given one rig was lavished on a student like J. Bradford Cutrell, the summa cum laude graduate in microbiology from UT who graduated No. 1 in his class at UT Southwestern last week, winning the top academic prize for having “a superlative medical mind”? Cutrell is an oil well. A homegrown one from Sulphur Springs, Texas. One that will never run dry.\n\nWe need more of him. We need thousands upon thousands of Cutrells here in Dallas. We can fuel our economy with graduates from California and Massachusetts and other states and other countries—up to a point. But that is no substitute for Texas- and Dallas-bred intellectual talent, with its roots in the community and its commitment to building Big D.\n\nWe never know enough in today's world and must embrace lifetime learning to achieve the American Dream. More and more, you earn what you learn. The U.S. economy today is far different than the one that employed our parents and grandparents in the fields and factories. Agriculture represents 2 percent of our national economy. Manufacturing employs only 11 percent of our workforce. Eighty-two percent of American workers are employed in services, a sprawling sector that includes some of the nation's most prestigious and highest-paying jobs. In Texas, average hourly wages in 2005 were $77.23 for internal medicine doctors, $44.81 for geological engineers, $39.53 for computer software engineers and $26.35 for registered nurses, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates. Those are handsome earnings statistics. We want as many of our people as possible working in those income brackets.\n\nChina, the former USSR nations and India together have roughly the same number of college grads age 25-plus as the U.S. does—about 54.1 million. There's no way to stay ahead of the pack without constantly pushing to educate our citizens and also grabbing foreign graduates whenever we can. But we do the opposite. We bring them over here, teach them everything we know—often with U.S.-financed scholarships and always at schools endowed with private U.S. monies and taxpayer funds—then send them back home by denying them citizenship! That has to be the most ridiculous investment paradigm ever, anywhere. We are in essence financing their capital plant and denying ourselves a return on our investment. It is as though we are spending a million dollars to drill a well in the Barnett Shale and then giving away the gas we find.\n\nQuestion: How do we compete with the masses of Chinese and Indians and Eastern Europeans and Vietnamese and Mexicans and Latin Americans who can grow and make stuff so much cheaper than we can? How do we stay ahead of them as they begin to move up the value-added ladder into the service sector, into technology, into programming and into software and the sciences?\n\nNon-answer: by closing up our ports and protecting our economy. We know from the 1930s what that does. Protectionism is a political prescription for economic ruin.\n\nAnswer: We stay ahead of our competitors. We move even faster up the value-added ladder. How? By using our brains—that area my father used to describe simply as “the little one-quart jar between your ears.” Our brains are our capital equipment. The brain is to the Knowledge Age what oil and electricity and mass production were to the Manufacturing Age. We need to nurture and grow more Brad Cutrells. We need to attract and retain every foreign brain we can. We need to provide them with academic homes they will want to come to and then stay around and add value to. We need to house them right here in River City—right here in Dallas.\n\nIf any of you leave this room today willing to accept the fact that Dallas, Texas, does not have one university ranked in the top 60 by either U.S. News & World Report or the Association of American Universities, then you are not the Rotarians whom I know and love. If any of you are willing to accept that David Daniel at the University of Texas at Dallas or Gerald Turner at Southern Methodist University or Kern Wildenthal at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center or Victor Boschini at Texas Christian University or Jim Spaniolo at the University of Texas at Arlington is fighting with one hand tied behind his back because the powers that be in Texas cannot rise above parochialism and give to this city what California has in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, or Los Angeles or San Diego or Santa Barbara, or what New York has in Manhattan, Rochester or Buffalo, then, well, you, my friends, are in a serious state of denial.\n\nAnd if you of all people, you as Rotarians, the Marines of civic life, cannot figure out a way for this city to win on the battlefield of higher education, then woe is the future of our beloved Dallas.",

            "content": "June 2, 2007 Dallas, Texas\n\nBefore I begin, I want all the candidates for degrees to do me a favor. Stand up, please. Now turn around. Look at all these people, over 2,000 of them. These are your parents, your spouses, your children, your lovers and friends, teachers and relatives. They have been at your side through joyful moments and less than joyful ones. They have encouraged you and badgered you as you approached and surmounted one hurdle after another in your remarkable lives. They have believed in you. And now they are here to celebrate with you the glorious commencement of your lifetime commitment to practicing and researching and advancing the most honorable of professions: the application of medical science to curing the sick, saving lives and solving the many unsolved mysteries of the body and mind.\n\nApplaud your admirers as they applaud you. Thank them for their love and support.\n\nNow, doctors to be, doctorates to be and medical scientist candidates, be seated.\n\nThe only thing that now stands between you and your degrees is … me. Before you walk across this stage and receive your well-earned diplomas and go on to celebrate, you have to listen to me speak, you poor souls. I promise to deliver a message that adheres to the underlying premise of both our professions: I will do no harm.\n\nI was admitted into the “society of educated men and women” at Harvard 36 years ago, when I became the first university graduate in the history of my family. Thirty-six years ago!\n\nMuch has changed since then, but one thing hasn’t. And that is the value of a great education and the celebration of its accomplishment.\n\nHow does a graduation speaker commemorate an event such as this? It is no easy thing.\n\nFor starters, there is the daunting task of appealing to such a broad diversity of backgrounds in these graduating classes. Which brings to mind the film made by the intrepid band of renegades in the graduating class of M.D.’s, which I happened to see Wednesday night at Northpark. Yes, I snuck into the screening of Medecins Sans Decence. I was especially intrigued by the bumper sticker and T-shirt logo. May I respectfully suggest that it be rewritten to read: “I (heart) va … riety.”\n\n…Which, by the way, your class represents more than adequately: You come from 22 states and from nine countries—Canada, China, Egypt, India, Japan, South Korea, Turkey, Taiwan and …Texas. You have your undergraduate degrees from 84 colleges and universities around the world.\n\nHow does one prepare a commencement address for such an assortment of degree candidates who share a common dedication but come from such diverse backgrounds?\n\nWell, the standard routine is to dig through Bartlett’s or the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations to find something said by some sage that puts the nobility of the profession you are about to enter in a glorious light. You might remember the definition of a good essay from your undergraduate days: It is a collection of other people’s thoughts disguised to look like your own.[1] Commencement speeches are no different.\n\nHoping to find something profound that I might pinch and adapt for your amusement, I wandered through abridged versions of the great sayings about doctors and medicine by the great minds of the ages—Socrates, Cicero, Mencius, St. Augustine, Voltaire, Martin Luther, Albert Schweitzer … Lindsay Lohan, Paris Hilton. Alas, I found nothing that was both inspiring and repeatable in mixed company.\n\nActually, I exaggerate. I found one. In the immortal words of the philosopher king Woody Allen,  “The greatest words in the English language are not ‘I love you.’ They are hearing your doctor say, ‘It is benign.’” By the authority vested in the diploma you are about to receive, your words and actions will carry enormous weight in society. Hold that thought.\n\nThe next thing a graduation speaker tries to do is offer a memorable maxim—a homily or platitude with which to send the graduating class off into a brave new world.\n\nGraduations are veritable festivals of maxims. Every commencement speaker dispenses them: Be disciplined; be prepared; be loyal, be thrifty, be brave; don’t waste your talents; to thine own self be true; question authority; take risks; push the envelope; a little rebellion every now and then is a good thing; respect your fellow man; serve others; never compromise your integrity; be true to yourself and your country; never promise more than you can deliver; never forsake your professional obligation; never forget that you have been given talent to do good; never, never, never, never give up the pursuit of excellence.\n\nThese are all good words. But, truth be told, it would save time and expedite many a commencement if the presidents of colleges or deans of schools would forgo the speaker and simply remind the graduates to read or listen to the books-on-tape versions of the Bible or the Koran or Shakespeare or Confucius, the ultimate sources of almost every graduation speech I have ever read or listened to. After all, for this ceremony tonight, it would be hard to improve upon the first line of the Analects of Confucius: “Is there no greater pleasure than to study and, in time, to practice what is studied?”[2]\n\nHow can you improve upon that for a group of scholars that has labored so diligently all these years in the study of medicine and medical science? After you receive your degree on this stage tonight, you will go on to practice what you have studied for so many arduous years. Surely, there is no greater pleasure: What you have learned here will now apply for real, forever.\n\nConsider yourself lucky because not all of us get to practice our studies. At Oxford, I read Latin American history as a graduate student. I wrote countless essays on Joaquín Balaguer, the most prolific writer in the Dominican Republic. Essays with titles like “Joaquín Balaguer: Nemesis or Patron Saint of Naboth’s Vineyard?” You can bet I have spent countless hours kicking that one around with Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke.\n\nBut you are embarking on career paths that will enable you to convert your rigorous education at UT Southwestern into practice. Into noble practice. A practical application of education that serves mankind. So with what maxim might I contrive to send you forth into a world you will shape? How could I improve upon the wisdom of the ages? Not easily. I dug deep into my memory banks and called upon a source more erudite than Shakespeare and more insightful than even Confucius—my mother.\n\nMy mother was a stoic Norwegian. She was raised in an outpost in South Africa, lost her father to the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 and grew up without the benefit of the kind of education you and I have been so blessed to receive. Yet, she was a wise woman. She dispensed exquisite pearls of wisdom to her children, a kind of female Nordic Yogi Berra. One is especially germane to this evening: “Never let your brains go to your head,” she said. The pun is horrific, but the message is profound: To achieve success you will need to keep your considerable talents in perspective.\n\nOscar Wilde said, “The public is wonderfully tolerant. It forgives everything except genius.” Being possessed of genius, much is expected of you. Once you accept the diploma you are about to receive, you will be a doctor—a doctor of medicine, a doctor of philosophy, an authority in medical science. You will have special obligations. Your patients and your collaborators will rely on everything you do and say. People will put into your hands their most precious possessions—their lives, their children’s lives, the lives of their parents, their colleagues and their employees. Enormous faith will be vested in your genius. Science will look to you to solve riddles heretofore unsolved. Even economists will look to you to find ways to escape the Sword of Damocles that shortsighted politicians have placed above our collective heads in the form of Medicare and other entitlement schemes, constructed without thought to their corrosive ultimate cost.\n\nYou will be looked to for answers. Your answers will be considered thoughtful and wise. “The greatest words are hearing your doctor say, ‘It is benign.’” Or, if it is not benign, “We can cure this.” Or, “We can ease your pain.” Or, “We have found a cure,” perhaps for AIDS or tuberculosis or Alzheimer’s or cancer or avian flu. You have the power to cure, to heal, to save. Use it wisely.\n\nUsing it wisely requires recognizing that having brains and years of superior training is necessary but insufficient for success.\n\nTime and time again, in research labs, in clinics, in universities and corporations and government offices—even supranational institutions like the World Bank—we see instances where men and women of towering intellect fail because they have forgotten to develop their emotional quotient with the same devotion they have applied to harnessing and channeling their intellectual quotient. My heartfelt advice to you is to work as hard on expanding your EQ as you have in developing your IQ.\n \nYou have reached the pinnacle of your formal education, the ultimate validation of your IQ (or the penultimate for those of you who go on to join the Academy of Sciences or become Nobel laureates or honored members of one distinguished medical society or another, which I’ll bet most of you will do). You will get there just as fast and enjoy it more if you remember that a sound mind resides most comfortably in a sound, well-rounded person and that a sound, well-rounded person has more than a superior brain. The whole person is as important an achievement for those privileged few who have been admitted to the “society of educated men and women” as is the achievement of intellectual excellence.\n\nWhich brings me to the third and last requirement for a commencement oration—a smattering of Latin. I’ll wrap up with this: “Bubbus, sed possum explicare. Non sed possum comprehendere.”\n\nFor those of you unschooled in the language of the ancient Romans, that is Texan Latin for “Bubba, I can explain it to you, but I can’t understand it for you.”\n\nThis evening, I have done my best to explain that true success comes to those who best put their talents in context and who connect a substantial intellect to an equally developed emotional capacity. Those of us who lead cerebral lives must constantly strive to elevate our “people skills” to a level equal to our intellectual skills. That’s the bottom line. I can explain it to you. But you must come to understand it on your own.\n\nAnd now, in deference to the iconic economist John Maynard Keynes, who reminded us all that despite the great efforts of devoted doctors and medical scientists, “in the long run, we are all dead,” and mindful that most of you want to get on and party, I say, “Bibamus, moriendum est.” Death is unavoidable. So let’s have a drink! (In moderation, of course.)\n\nI look forward with great pleasure to having a drink with you after you receive your well-deserved degrees and to toasting your achievement and success.",

            "content": "May 24, 2007 Dallas, Texas\n\nThis conference on inflation measurement has been jointly organized by Mark Wynne and Jim Dolmas of the Dallas Fed and David Altig and Michael Bryan of the Cleveland Fed. For their dedicated effort and superb accomplishment in getting participants and presenters from over 21 countries, I am most grateful.\n\nThe presentations today are devoted mainly to the question of core inflation measurement, while the presentations tomorrow will look at various approaches to the measurement of expected inflation.\n\nDuring the next two days, we will hear presentations by leading students of the subject—academics and economists from the Federal Reserve System and participants and presenters from a number of other central banks, including the European Central Bank, Bank for International Settlements, Bank of Italy, National Bank of Belgium, Reserve Bank of Australia and National Bank of Poland. Governor Mishkin will be the keynote speaker at tonight’s dinner.\n\nThe discussants, who play an equally important role in determining the success of a conference like this, have been drawn from the Chicago, Kansas City and San Francisco Feds, as well as from the Bank of Canada, IMF, Bank of Mexico, Bank of Sweden, Brandeis University, the University of Illinois and London Business School. We also have people attending from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, Bank of Iceland, Bank of England, Swiss National Bank, National Bank of Romania, Bank of Korea and the Central Bank of the Netherlands, among others, along with many local area academics.\n\nAll in all, we have a very diverse group participating in this conference. For those of you who have come from afar, we welcome you. Texas is a very friendly place. We are honored that you are here, and we hope you will enjoy our hospitality.\n\nThe first paper this morning will be presented by Diana Weymark of Vanderbilt University. The paper looks at ways of constructing operational measures of inflation pressure and specifically proposes three new indexes for measuring such pressure, the extent to which such pressure is alleviated and the effectiveness of monetary policy in reducing expected inflation. One of the interesting findings of the paper is that the proposed indexes show the extent to which the Fed under Chairman Greenspan consistently resisted inflationary pressures and capitalized on deflationary pressures to bring inflation down whenever the opportunity arose.\n\nProfessor Weymark’s paper will be followed by a paper by Julie Smith of Lafayette College. Professor Smith is one of the few academic experts who continue to think about ways of coming up with better measures of core inflation, and indeed, that is the title of her presentation. In her view, core inflation should be defined as the measure of inflation that best predicts future inflation. The central idea in her paper is that core inflation should be measured by adding up the components of the PCE deflator, but weighting them according to how they behave over time.\n\nOne of our main criticisms here at the Dallas Fed of much of the core inflation literature is that it lacks theoretical coherence. It reminds me of the time-honored saying that an economist is someone who sees something work in practice and then wonders if it can work in theory. Today’s third paper, presented by Stefano Siviero of the Bank of Italy, tries to address this issue by proposing a measure of core inflation that weights individual prices on the basis of their usefulness in helping the central bank achieve its goal of price stability. One of the interesting findings of the paper is that a central bank that responds to the traditional “ex-food and energy” measure of core inflation does no better than one that responds to headline inflation. This raises important questions about the utility of the core measure in policy deliberations.\n\nMeasuring core inflation can get quite technical, and the fourth paper for today, presented by Richard Anderson of the St. Louis Fed, is an excellent example in this regard. I won’t try to summarize it for you unless you have a strong desire to learn about “wavelets” from someone whose closest encounter with them was while surfing as a teenager. The central idea in the paper goes way back to the great 19th century Irish economist Francis Edgeworth, who proposed that when calculating overall inflation, individual prices should be weighted not by their share in aggregate expenditure but rather by their volatility, with more volatile prices getting a smaller weight in the overall index.\n\nThe trimmed mean approach to core measurement, which is the way the Dallas Fed prefers to evaluate inflation, is analyzed at some length in the two papers that follow. One, by a pioneer in this line of research, Mike Bryan of the Cleveland Fed, argues that the trimmed mean approach is particularly good at detecting shifts in trend inflation in low-inflation environments. The other, by Anthony Richards of the Reserve Bank of Australia, provides additional evidence on the superior performance of trimmed mean measures using data for the U.S., euro area, Japan and Australia. One innovation in this paper is to break up the owners’ equivalent rent (OER) component of the U.S. CPI along regional lines to further improve the performance of the trimmed mean.\n\nBut lest you think that that settles the debate in favor of the trimmed mean approach, the last paper today, by New York Fed economists Robert Rich and Charles Steindel, casts doubt on the usefulness of any core measure. Their point is that the superior performance of various measures is very sensitive to the sample period being looked at; some measures do well in some periods and some do well in others, leaving little basis for trusting in one measure at all times.\n\nTomorrow, the conference will look at various approaches to the measurement of inflation expectations. The first two papers, to be presented by Stefania D’Amico of the Board of Governors and Oreste Tristani of the ECB, look at how we can use the prices of financial instruments to make inferences about inflation expectations. Dr. D’Amico and her fellow coauthors at the Board of Governors find that the TIPS break-even rate is a useful proxy for inflation expectations in the U.S., despite the fact that the yield on TIPS is known to contain a significant liquidity premium. Dr. Tristani and his coauthor from the Bank of International Settlements are concerned with the interpretation of term premia in the euro area and find that these premia seem to reflect primarily real rather than inflation risks.\n\nAn alternative approach to measuring inflation expectations is to simply go out and ask people what they think inflation is going to be over the next year or two or 10. Our very own Mark Wynne spent a good deal of time working at the European Central Bank on the European Monetary Union. One of his enduring contributions to the EMU was to design the ECB’s Survey of Professional Forecasters, which is now featured every three months in the ECB’s Monthly Bulletin. Two papers on Friday, one presented by economist Juan Angel García of the ECB and another by Aidan Meyler, also of the ECB, will look at the usefulness and track record of this survey and the similar one that is run by the Philadelphia Fed. Well-designed surveys of forecasters can shed light on inflation risks, a topic of perennial interest to central bankers.\n\nOf course, it is not just the expectations of professional forecasters that should be of interest to central bankers. The inflation expectations of firms and households matter as well. The penultimate paper of the conference, by three economists from the Polish central bank and presented tomorrow by author Ryszard Kokoszcynski, will look at the performance of measures of household inflation expectations in a group of central European countries. One of the problems with the European Commission’s survey of household inflation expectations is that it elicits qualitative rather than quantitative information, and these responses then need to be further “massaged” before they can be used in assessing the inflation outlook.\n\nIn addition to asking households about inflation expectations, the European Commission survey also asks about inflation perceptions. Normally the perceived rates of inflation in the EU and the rates measured by statisticians track each other quite well. But at the time of the euro cash changeover, there was a huge discrepancy between what the statisticians were measuring and what households said they were experiencing, raising questions about the credibility of the official inflation measures. The final paper of the conference, presented by Marianne Collin of the National Bank of Belgium, looks at what happened and concludes that there was simply a structural break in the relationship between measured and perceived inflation at the time of the cash changeover.\n\nThat is the menu for this feast of thought. I hope you enjoy the discussions and that all of us who are privileged to partake in this conference will leave with renewed vigor and determination to better understand inflation and use that understanding to inform those of us who have responsibility for making monetary policy.",

            "content": "May 14, 2007 Washington, D.C.\n\nPeter Ustinov, the great actor, used to chide the British foreign service by saying he was “convinced there is a small room in the attic of the Foreign Office where future diplomats are taught to stammer.” We do not stammer at the Fed, but we have been known to mumble on occasion. In most central banks, there has traditionally been a premium paid for being opaque.\n\nAlas, obscurity is not our privilege in the reality show that is today’s financial world.\n\nThe conduct of monetary policy is inherently a forward-looking exercise: The Fed sets policy with the goal of holding future inflation at a reasonable minimum while helping economic activity and employment grow at maximum sustainable rates. To do so, the Fed must consider both current and expected inflation and growth. A certain degree of transparency and clarity helps increasingly sophisticated business and financial market operators manage risk. Mindful that our actions and deeds condition the expectations of risk takers, it makes sense for central bankers to provide context for our decisions.\n\nThis evening, I would like to give you a little perspective from my perch at the Dallas Fed. I would like to talk, hopefully with nary a mumble nor stammer, about the service sector and what I consider the consequences of having services, rather than manufacturing, as the driving force of our economy. These views are my own and, I hasten to add, do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nFirst, let me give you some facts to set the stage. America’s economy is a behemoth. In 2005, the Dallas district of the Federal Reserve System—all of Texas, 26 parishes in Louisiana and 18 counties in New Mexico—produced 25 percent more output than India in dollar terms. The Twelfth District, headquartered in San Francisco and overseen by my colleague Janet Yellen, produced more output than all of China. The 140 million workers in the United States produce over $13.2 trillion in economic output; 82 percent of those 140 million workers are employed in the service sector, producing 70 percent of our GDP.\n\nOver the decades, the inexorable forces of capitalist evolution have shifted our economic base from agriculture to manufacturing and now to services. The iconic economist Joseph Schumpeter wrote that “stabilized capitalism is a contradiction in terms.” The transformation of the American economic landscape over time is testimony to our ability to harness our innovative, educated and entrepreneurial culture to master—rather than be victimized by—the instability that is inherent in capitalism. Since the first risk takers arrived on the shores of Virginia and at Plymouth Rock, it has been in our DNA to climb up the value-added ladder. A little history:\n\nLet me put these numbers in perspective for you by contrasting them with China. Today, about 44 percent of China’s working population is still in agriculture, compared with America’s 2 percent. Employment in the Chinese industrial sector is 23 percent, compared with our 16 percent. China’s service sector employs a little bit more than 30 percent of China’s laborers, compared with our 82 percent. In other words, China’s labor distribution between agriculture, industry and services is about the same as ours was in 1900.\n\nSince the demise of Mao, the Chinese have made great strides in improving their education system. They are producing graduates in prodigious quantities. And yet they are a long way from having the quality educational system needed to produce trained workers capable of rivaling ours. Around 15 percent of China’s population aged 25–65 has a high school degree, compared with 85 percent in the United States. One of every 20 Chinese in that age group has a college degree, compared with one in three in the U.S. In China, 700 people out of every million are R&D researchers. Here, that number is at least 6.5 times higher.\n\nAnd in terms of wealth, it is interesting to note that China’s real GDP per capita is roughly 1/25th the size of ours, about the same level as what the U.S. achieved over a century ago.\n\nOur per capita wealth has grown as we’ve moved up the value-added ladder. Generally speaking, our highest paying jobs are in services—engineers, scientists, computer systems analysts, stock brokers, professors, doctors, lawyers, dentists, CPAs, entertainers and other service providers, to say nothing of the mega-compensation paid to hedge fund managers and financial engineers.\n\nBeginning in 1993, the average wage for private services employees surpassed base industry wages. By 1999, all nonretail services employees, even public service employees like government workers and teachers, were averaging more pay per hour than industrial workers.\n\nThe destructive side of the process of capitalism’s “creative destruction” is evident in the numbers as old professions give way to new, higher-paying ones. The number of U.S. farm laborers decreased 20 percent between 1992 and 2002. In the same 10-year time frame, employment of telephone operators decreased 45 percent. That of sewing machine operators decreased 50 percent between 1992 and 2002. This is not ancient history; this all occurred within a time frame that is fresh in the memory of everyone in this room.\n\nYet within that same time frame—between 1992 and 2002—the number of architects grew 44 percent, legal assistants 66 percent and financial services employees 78 percent. In fact, Internet-related job categories didn't even exist until the early 1990s. The creative side of creative destruction has replaced lost jobs in declining sectors with new ones in emerging sectors.\n\nSince 1992, the goods-producing sector has seen its share of nonfarm payrolls fall by 3.9 percentage points. However, the losses have been more than offset by job gains in just three service sectors—professional and business services, health care, and leisure and hospitality.\n\nToday, manufacturing employs one of 10 U.S. workers, about the same number as the leisure and hospitality sector. One in 20 works in construction—fewer than in financial services. Nearly the same number of people work in government as in the goods-producing sector as a whole. In the past year, the number of manufacturing jobs shrank by 1 percent. In contrast, employment grew by around 3 percent in education, health care, and leisure and hospitality and by over 5 percent in professional services.\n\nHere is a statistic that about beats all: At the end of 2005, the U.S. auto and auto parts manufacturing industry employed about 1.1 million workers and added 0.8 percent of the value to our GDP. The legal services sector employed nearly the same number, but contributed 1.5 percent of the value added to GDP. I will resist the temptation to make a lawyer joke because this is no laughing matter to economists: The legal services industry provides as many jobs as auto manufacturers but contributes nearly twice the value-added to our economic output.\n\nI think you get the point: The service sector, not autos and other forms of traditional manufacturing, drives our economy. And will continue doing so.\n\nLooking forward, the Department of Commerce projects that the fastest growing jobs between now and 2014 will be among general managers, health care workers, postsecondary teachers, retail salespeople, customer service reps and other service providers. In contrast, among the jobs with the greatest projected decline will be textile plant workers, machine operators, farmers and ranchers, meter readers, computer and telephone operators, typists, couriers and, to the relief of all families who like to sit down to supper undisturbed, telemarketers and door-to-door salespeople.\n\nThe shift of jobs away from the goods and lower-value-added service sectors to higher-end services is not a new phenomenon. Indeed, it is part of a longer term trend of employment moving to sectors that produce for an increasingly wealthy country, meet the health care needs of our aging population, and provide U.S. employers with the highly trained and flexible workers they need in a broader, more accessible global economy brimming with unskilled labor.\n\nAs people get richer, they shift their spending toward relatively more services. Evidence can be found in the buying patterns of U.S. households, in the historical timeline of the U.S. economy and in nations around the world. For every dollar Americans spend on goods, we spend $1.70 on services—roughly a 60 percent mix in favor of services. In contrast, China spends 58 percent of its consumption on goods versus 42 percent on services. In even poorer India, services represent just 37 percent of spending—the reverse image of the U.S.\n\nIn 1979, I was a young member of the U.S. delegation President Carter sent to China to settle the claims left after Mao’s government seized the railroad rolling stock we had lent Chiang Kai-shek. President Nixon had normalized political relations in the early 1970s, but it fell to President Carter to normalize economic relations and finally raise the flag at the U.S. Embassy.\n\nSo that we could begin to trade with each other and get on with a normal relationship, Treasury Secretary Michael Blumenthal was dispatched to negotiate with Deng Xiaoping. I was Blumenthal’s assistant, so I accompanied him to all his meetings with the Chinese leader. I will never forget our first meeting with Deng. He was electrifying. You may remember he was a short fellow—barely 5 feet, if memory serves—but he was a giant of a man with big dreams. In our first meeting, he entered the room and cackled, “Where are these big American capitalists I am supposed to be so afraid of?”\n\nHe then laid out his vision of driving China down “the capitalist road,” a plan he did not proclaim publicly until later. Deng told us then that he would unleash the Chinese genius and focus it on development and modernization. To him, when it came to ideologies, it didn’t “matter whether it is a yellow cat or a black cat, as long as it catches mice.”\n\nWe all know the Chinese have caught economic mice in droves. Since 1979, China reports having grown at better than 9.6 percent a year, adding up to a better-than tenfold expansion of the economy to date. China’s factories produced 200 room air conditioners in 1978; today, they claim to make 79 million a year. Back in the dark old days of rigid central planning, the Chinese produced 679,000 tons of plastics; last year, they were up to 25 million tons—37 times as much. In 2003, China turned out 260 billion more square feet of cloth than it did in 1978. Today’s great building boom is occurring in China, where their government reported 38 billion square feet of floor space was under construction in 2005 for all kinds of structures, compared with 5.7 billion square feet in the United States.\n\nAs China grows—and clearly its manufacturing sector is fueling a very fast growth rate—we know its demand for services will increase even faster. This is good news for U.S. services businesses, because we are king of the global services providers, with an impressive array of sophisticated and high-quality products and services available for sale.\n\nThe size and wealth of our market and our tradition of consumer sovereignty have created the largest and most advanced service economy in the world, a fact reflected in our trade balance. We have consistently run a massive trade deficit—we have done so since the ’70s. Few, however, realize that we run a growing surplus in services trade. That surplus topped $70 billion in 2006, trimming down our overall trade deficit by over 8 percent. Perhaps more important, the positive services gap has been getting bigger.\n\nThe U.S. remains a major destination for international travelers, so it should come as no surprise that in the bookkeeping for our external account, travel is the largest private service we export. Lately, however, travel’s prominence in the statistics has been challenged by other higher-value-added services. Over the past decade, exports of travel, transportation and tourism have grown by 2.9 percent per year. By contrast, computer and information services and research and development have been growing at a double-digit pace. Similar stories abound. Our business services of accounting, auditing, management and consulting—along with insurance, finance and training—have increased mightily, thanks to technological advances that have made those services more tradable. With 16 percent of the world population plugged into the Internet and 41 percent using cell phones, many knowledge-based services can today be sold across the oceans through cyberspace at a fraction of traditional shipping costs.\n\nAmerica tends to export things that are high on the value-added ladder and import from lower down. In computer and information services, for example, we export $5.4 billion and import $2.2 billion. Dig deeper into the data and you will find that we largely export the services of systems architects and designers, while we import the services of basic programmers, who are the foot soldiers of the information economy. In services exports, as in manufacturing and agriculture, we are constantly moving up the value-added ladder.\n\nWe export twice as much intellectual property as we import. Our royalty and license fee income has been growing at 8 percent a year since 1992. Our exports of legal services have grown at 7 percent per year, and they now total nearly five times our imports. Exports of industrial engineering services have increased 18 percent per year since 1992, and we are now shipping out 13 times as much as we are receiving.\n\nOur exports of film and TV rentals are 11 times greater than our imports. Of the 15 biggest-budget Hollywood movies made as of 2006, eight of them would have lost money if seen only in the U.S.—a total of $458 million in losses among them. However, when you include overseas sales, not only did all eight of them make money, but as a group they netted nearly $1.1 billion after production costs.\n\nWhen I was deputy U.S. trade representative, the late, great Jack Valenti used to lobby me ferociously to negotiate the opening of foreign markets to U.S.-made films. His argument was as straight as Occam’s razor: Without the globalization of movies, studios would have had to scale back budgets, make smaller sets, use cruder animation, not-so-special effects and not-so-talented actors and actresses, and create otherwise less sophisticated and entertaining movies. Opening other countries’ markets to our movies would mean bigger and better movies for us to enjoy and more jobs created here at home. Jack was spot on. He would not have been the least bit surprised by the blockbuster revenues earned globally by Spiderman 3 over the past 10 days.\n\nHere is the point: Be it in movies or industrial engineering design, in the service arena we are hotter than Scarlett Johansson. In high-value-added services, the United States holds a significant global competitive advantage.\n\nThe ubiquitous iPod tells the tale. Engraved on the back of my iPod are the words: “Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China.” As we send our services out into the world, send our designs to Chinese or Vietnamese or Mexican factories—factories we played a role in designing, by the way—or educate foreigners in our universities, or build R&D centers in India or Estonia or Israel, we are planting apple seeds all over the world. As long as those seeds are allowed to germinate and sprout into economic growth, the world will demand more of our value-added services. And as long as we here at home foster good economic conditions—including well-administered monetary policy—that allow our entrepreneurs to continue creating and selling services demanded globally, we will continue to create American jobs and enhance our prosperity.\n\nI mention “well-administered monetary policy” deliberately. Obviously, the women and men who create and build our high-end economy work best when they are undistracted by inflation or other forms of economic turbulence. They can do their job best when we do our job best by administering monetary policy that underwrites sustainable noninflationary growth.\n\nThe shift to a service economy, however, has made the conduct of monetary policy both more difficult and easier. Let me touch on the challenges it poses for monetary policymakers.\n\nThe service sector is hard to measure. Services are intangible. The data for measuring the impact of services are more squishy than the relatively straightforward accounting for output in agriculture and the manufactured goods sector. To assess services, we must rely on surveys and the good judgment of the statisticians who interpret them.\n\nThere are sophisticated techniques for conducting these surveys. Yet when it comes to services, we cannot easily discern differences between quality improvements and inflationary price increases. This is less of an issue with goods, where we can more readily identify quality changes such as improvements in durability or serviceability. For example, improvements in automobiles are measured through the introduction of seatbelts, airbags and crash-worthy bumpers; the increased durability of engine and suspension components; electronic enhancements that improve fuel efficiency; better sound systems; voice-activated navigation systems and so on.\n\nBut in services, quality improvements are less clear. If your barber raises the price of a haircut, is it because you are getting a better haircut, or is it because the shop is passing on its increasing costs, or is there some other factor at play? I’m sure you’ve seen $15 haircuts at a strip-mall barbershop, and you’ve at least heard of hundred-dollar stylings offered by salons along Wisconsin Avenue. Four-hundred-dollar haircuts have been reported—even on the heads of Democrats. Presumably, there is a quality difference between them, but we can’t measure it the way we can with a ’67 Mustang and Ford’s 2007 model, or between the computing power of an old IBM mainframe and a modern Dell laptop.\n\nThis isn’t rocket science—it’s more challenging than that. In rocket science, the objective is defined and the process involves applying established mathematics. The value of services is less quantifiable, less well defined, and requires considerable judgment to distinguish between price changes resulting from inflationary pressures versus differences in quality.\n\nTake what I do for a living as another example. Government agencies that measure employment and economic activity classify central banking under a broad category called “financial services—other.” It is a service. We serve the public by distributing cash and coin, maintaining an efficient payments system, supervising banks and setting monetary policy—what many might consider important functions. If we perform our services well, the economy keeps on humming, creating jobs and building wealth. If we fail, or just mess up every now and then, our missteps send ripples through the economy. Cash does not arrive at banks or checks don’t clear, inflation gains momentum or employment grows at a suboptimal rate. Yet I can’t point to where our success shows up in GDP statistics. Nor can I tell you how much more or less productive I am versus my predecessors or counterparts.\n\nOur inability to fully distinguish between quality improvements and inflation in services means that when we look at growth in nominal GDP, we can’t be entirely sure how much results from the gains in real output and how much is inflation.\n\nThat is one set of issues. And there are others. In accounting for a knowledge-based economy, for example, the very concept of investment should be broader than the traditional focus on equipment and structures. U.S. government statisticians have already expanded the definition of business investment to include software. Arguably, they should be looking at education spending—which is the very foundation of our knowledge economy—in the same way, instead of counting education costs as a consumption expense.\n\nThe point is that in our efforts to assess the speed limit and engine temperature of the economy, we have plenty of gauges on our dashboard that we can use for evaluating the manufacturing sector. Yet we are deprived of similarly reliable gauges for measuring capacity utilization and other dynamics of the service sector. We spend a terrific amount of time analyzing domestic manufacturing reports—think of the media attention given to the Philadelphia Fed’s manufacturing index or the Empire State Index or, if you are astute, the Dallas Fed’s manufacturing index for a district—forgive my Texas brag—that produces more manufactured products than the areas covered by either the Philadelphia or New York surveys. Manufacturing data is so refined that I can tell you whether the plastic we make is used for a bag, bottle, pipe, pillow or floor. Yet, as our economy becomes ever more services-oriented, relying on traditional, goods-focused indicators as predictors of economic activity or inflection points in the business cycle becomes more and more suspect. As comparative advantages are redistributed by globalization, the importance of foreign capacity measurements for manufacturing increases. And the need for a services capacity metric here at home becomes imperative. And yet we—and this is a collective “we,” encompassing the economics profession worldwide, not just the Fed—have perfected neither.\n\nHerein lies an opportunity for enterprising analysts to rise to the challenge I’ve just presented and profit from the development of new data that can help alleviate the deficiencies in service-sector metrics. Many—including our co-host this afternoon, the Coalition of Service Industries—draw well-deserved attention to our services sector, measuring its size, growth, scope and composition to drive home the point that the U.S. economy is services driven. While we can slice and dice the data we have, we still don’t have enough of it available to help us monitor trends with the level of detail and timeliness we have for our goods-producing sectors.\n\nI’ll conclude by calling your attention to another aspect of the growing importance of services in the U.S. economy, a subtle, behind-the-scenes contribution that services are making to the decoupling of the overall economy from the manufacturing sector.\n\nAllow me to draw your attention to Arthur Conan Doyle’s mystery, “Silver Blaze.” In that story, a Scotland Yard inspector asks Sherlock Holmes, “Is there any point to which you would wish to draw my attention?” Holmes replies, “To the curious incident of the dog in the night-time.” Puzzled, the inspector notes, “The dog did nothing in the night-time.” “That was the curious incident,” Holmes says. The dog did not bark.\n\nA “curious incident” happened in the U.S. economy during the 2001 downturn. Factory output fell by almost as much during that recession as in the 1981 recession 20 years earlier—7 percent in 2001 versus 8 percent in 1981. Yet, GDP declined by less than half a percentage point in the 2001 downturn versus 3 percent in 1981. The mystery is why the aggregate economy was so much less affected in 2001.\n\nUndoubtedly, a significant part of the explanation is the sharply declining and relatively low real interest rates in the latter period, which helped sustain the construction industry. But it is also important to note the very different behavior of the goods component of GDP across the two episodes. In 1981, “total goods sector” output fell by the same amount as factory output. In 2001, it fell by only half the decline seen in manufacturing. To use the Holmes analogy, goods output “barked” loudly in 1981 in response to the collapse of manufacturing. In 2001, goods output merely whimpered.\n\nThis curious incident points to the solution to our mystery: What the Commerce Department calls “goods-sector output” in fact includes a growing retail and distribution services component that is relatively insensitive to fluctuations in factory production. This was the dog that did not bark. The merchandising services component of goods-sector output declined relatively little in 2001 and helped insulate the economy from the manufacturing collapse.\n\nThe service sector may not be as noisy or get as much analytical or political attention as the manufacturing sector, but it has a significant bite in terms of its impact on economic performance. That is the point to which I hope to have drawn your attention today. As we seek to conduct monetary policy, we will have to develop new methods for determining exactly how the service sector's bite affects the business cycle and economic behavior.\n\nEnough said. Thank you for listening. Let’s stop there, and in the best interest of being transparent, I will do my best to mumble and stammer through responses to your questions.",

            "content": "April 26, 2007 Austin, Texas\n\nThank you, Luther [King]. You are a generous man. Luther chairs the ad hoc Financial Advisory Group that I occasionally convene at the Dallas Fed and is an invaluable advisor. But his and Teresa’s friendship with the Fisher family goes way back: Teresa was the deaconess who guided our daughter Texana through her confirmation at Highland Park Presbyterian Church a long time ago—in fact, in the last century. Our boys know each other and are friends. And from a professional point of view, I have admired—and been jealous of—Luther since I first started up Brown Brothers’ operations in Texas almost 30 years ago. He is a man of punctilious courtesy and the nicest sense of personal honor and about as decent and forthright a friend as anybody could hope to have. I am honored to be here with you today, Luther.\n\nI used to be one of you. As Luther kindly mentioned, I ran a little investment advisory firm and hedge fund way back in the days when the clients and limited partners made more money than the investment advisors and general partners did. Imagine that!\n\nI had planned to speak today about four conundra: the impact of globalization; the problem with relying on the data that you and I and we all look at to gauge economic performance; how you—and I use the term “you” deliberately, as you will see later in this talk—will deal with the problems of fiscal recklessness that have led us into a cul-de-sac of long-term liabilities of almost unfathomable dimension; and what a former distinguished associate used to refer to as the yield-curve-shape “conundrum.”\n\nUpon reflection, however, I realized that the latter is really not much of a conundrum. Let me explain, employing the caveat that I am speaking today, as I always do, solely in my personal capacity and am in no way speaking on behalf of the Federal Open Market Committee or for anybody else in the Federal Reserve.\n\nThere is an enormous amount of liquidity coursing though the arteries and veins and capillaries of the financial system worldwide. There is only so much of that liquidity that can be placed by responsible fiduciaries in lesser credits since the markets for non-dollar, non-euro, non-pound denominated paper are limited. This is not to say that investors have declined to invest in other markets, as we see clearly in the narrow spreads between the biggest and most established credits and lesser ones.\n\nBesides, the most prominent central banks have been exemplars of good behavior: the rectitude of the Fed, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England is, I think, above question. (As, incidentally, has been the behavior of the Aussies, the Canadians, the Mexicans and many others). The Fed and other central banks have gained credibility in keeping inflation low and stable.\n\nBetter inventory policy has helped make real rates more predictable by smoothing out business cycles. Pension funds are—surprise!—actually matching their investments to the maturity schedule of their liabilities. And in a rapidly globalized world, foreign demand for Treasuries has increased both for portfolio diversification needs and the desire of some newly flush central banks to have ample reserves to reduce currency volatility.\n\nDeclines in risk premia are therefore understandable against the background of sustained, robust growth worldwide, the concomitant reduction in volatility of the global macroeconomy and less inflation risk. And the use of derivatives has reduced the short-term price risk of long instruments, including Treasuries. So, where is the conundrum? Why is it so puzzling that longer rates are relatively low?\n\nNow, to be sure, one might try to dispense with the “riddle” of the yield curve by arguing that the reason for having a flat to negatively sloped yield curve is that the market is forecasting the possible onset of recession.\n\nIt is true that inverted yield curves have historically presaged recession, but with one rather interesting exception that old folks like Luther—let me restate that—that the historians among you—will recall. In 1967, we had a credit crunch hit the housing sector particularly hard and we were fighting an unpopular war in a far-off land. The yield curve flattened, then inverted, yet no recession ensued.\n\nThat said, I think that as we progress deeper and deeper into a globalized marketplace with more sophisticated methods for hedging risk, and with central banks working double time, overtime, to exorcise the demon of inflation, there are reasons other than concern for the future of the economy for investors to lower the risk premia they have historically demanded as they move out along the yield curve.\n\nWhich leaves us with the other three conundra.\n\nBy now, many of you know that globalization is a preoccupation of the Dallas Fed. We are building the Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute. We orient most of our research and prepare for Federal Open Market Committee meetings by looking at the world through a global lens.\n\nWe surmise that the integration of markets for goods, services and capital has been facilitated by the physical and cyber linkage of the planet. That integration has changed the gearing of the U.S. economy and brought into question many, if not most, of our most treasured economic and monetary conventions.\n\nWe see tremendous behavioral shifts in the real world as middle managers everywhere take advantage of increased global integration by reaching across physical borders and though cyberspace to drive down their costs of goods sold and their G&A costs, tighten their inventory management, improve supply-chain efficiency, enhance productivity and access new markets.\n\nWe note that this goes deeper than the simple trade in goods. And we know that it affects not-for-profit enterprise as readily as for-profit enterprise.\n\nLet me give you a simple example. One of the great lung specialists in the world is Dr. Jonathan Weissler, the chief of medicine at UT Southwestern in Dallas. After he sees a patient, he dictates his notes into a wireless voice recorder. The recording is transmitted electronically to a service that employs English-speaking scribes all over the world, often in India. When Dr. Weissler comes to work the next morning, there on his desktop is a transcript. So while the good doctor gets his 40-winks-sleep overnight, someone in India has written up his notes at a fraction of the cost of having them transcribed locally and—of concern to those worried about the status of education here in the U.S.A.—with greater accuracy. Dr. Weissler’s productivity is enhanced. With the savings that come from utilizing globalization, he can put more time and money into saving lives here at home.\n\nWe see this pattern repeated over and over again, countless times in every size and shape of enterprise. So what is the conundrum here? What riddle does globalization’s impact pose? Well, the riddle, or more appropriately, the question, is whether or not this impacts how the Federal Reserve executes policy in accordance with our dual mandate to foster the monetary conditions necessary to foster noninflationary sustainable employment growth.\n\nHow do we deliver on this mandate in a globalized world? How do we monitor global capacity constraints when statisticians in other countries measure things differently and at different time intervals? What instruments should we use to determine the optimal speed that our economy can grow in a rapidly integrating world? In economists’ terms, what is our NAIRU—our non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment? What is its impact on inflationary expectations? How is globalization conditioning the behavior of workers? Of consumers? Of capital?\n\nNo one really has the answers, although some pretend to. So we are working hard at the Dallas Fed and throughout the Federal Reserve to come up with new data and new models that fit the new world.\n\nWhich brings me to the next conundrum: the phenomenon of “data dependency.” Some time ago, I gave a speech titled “Confessions of a Data Dependent.” This was back when it was in vogue to say that monetary policy was data-dependent. And yet, upon reflection, I have personally come to feel that this is a bit of an oxymoron, a contradiction in terms, like “jumbo shrimp” or “instant analysis.” Why? Because so much of the data you and I consider essential are moving targets, subject to constant revision—perhaps because the new, globalized gearing of the economy makes measurement so difficult. How “data dependent” can we really be?\n\nIn the 1920s, there was a British Inland Revenue agent who later became a director of the Bank of England named Josiah Charles Stamp. Stamp once quoted a friend who had observed, “The Government [is] extremely fond of amassing great quantities of statistics. These are raised to the nth degree, the cube roots are extracted, and the results arranged into elaborate and impressive displays. What must be kept in mind, however, is that in every case, the figures are first put down by a village watchman, and he puts down anything he damn well pleases!”\n\nAmerica’s statisticians are a careful lot who do not record anything they darn well please. But it is important to remember that even our best measures of economic performance are subject to substantial revision well after the fact, not only because the modern equivalent of the village watchman occasionally puts down faulty numbers, but also because we can’t always get numbers from all the watchmen in real time.\n\nThere is a tension between timely data and accurate data. Timely data are often based on estimates and probabilities that are injected to fill in missing numbers, only to be changed when more complete information comes in. Markets react to the timely data with apoplectic frenzy, only to have the same number quietly revised many months or even years later in light of more substantiated evidence, but without the same market fanfare.\n\nLet’s go to the videotape on inflation. In the 1990s, concern grew that our main inflation gauge, the Consumer Price Index, was providing a distorted view of price trends. A pickup in the pace of productivity growth in some sectors and an expansion of the reach of global markets due to the far-reaching trade-liberalization policies of Presidents George H. W. Bush (“41”) and Bill Clinton were, together, leading to sharp declines in the relative price of goods like apparel and consumer electronics. The CPI reflects the resultant shift in household spending patterns with a substantial lag and, in the meantime, puts too little weight on falling prices and too much weight on rising prices. The more quickly household spending patterns change, the greater the likelihood of upward bias in CPI inflation.\n\nAn alternative inflation gauge—the deflator for personal consumption expenditures—both continuously adjusts for changes in the composition of household spending and also has broader coverage than the CPI. So, in 2000, federal policymakers adopted the PCE price index excluding food and energy as their preferred measure of inflation trends.\n\nUnfortunately, the nice theoretical properties of the PCE inflation measure come at a price: PCE inflation is not released until several weeks after CPI inflation (which confuses the public) and is revised, often substantially, when new, more complete estimates of the composition of household spending become available (which confuses the analytical community).\n\nCore inflation for 2003 was initially reported out at 0.9 percent. Later, having gone back and studied the entrails, the Commerce Department put inflation during 2003 a full half percentage point higher, at 1.4 percent. Similarly, 2004 core inflation was initially thought to be 1.6 percent, but subsequent revisions put it at 2.2 percent.\n\nOr look at GDP estimates. The first release received for GDP growth for the fourth quarter of last year was 3.5 percent. A month later, it was revised downward to 2.2 percent. Recently it was revised upward to 2.5 percent.\n\nRemember this when the numbers for the first quarter of this year are released tomorrow. GDP growth, industrial production, retail sales and payroll employment are imperfect statistics that make a splash when they are first released and yet hardly make a ripple when their true nature is finally revealed.\n\nData revisions have important implications for policymaking and policy evaluation. Potentially, they can erode central bank credibility. Partly because of data revisions, it is hard for us to spot turning points in the economy. The fact is, statistical agencies fill in missing data with extrapolations that are especially likely to be wrong at these turning points because the estimates and probabilities they use are biased toward the latest trend. The result is that we are likely to underestimate slowdowns and pickups at precisely the moment when we need to take corrective action.\n\nInevitably, a monetary policymaker’s reliance on data that are subject to revision means that some decisions would have been marginally different with the benefit of hindsight. I say “marginally different” for two reasons. First, the FOMC is eclectic in that it monitors a broadly diversified portfolio of indicators and reports from a variety of sources in the expectation that the noise elements in the various indicators and reports will tend to cancel one another out. This portfolio approach limits the weight on any one piece of information or any one source. Second, our policy decisions are influenced by what’s happened in the past mostly through how the past conditions the outlook for the future: We’re focused on where inflation and real growth seem to be heading, more so than on where they’ve been.\n\nIn this respect, Fed policymakers are value investors rather than momentum traders. After hard experience, we’ve learned how to deal with revisions and are able to manage them more or less successfully. We don’t radically alter policy based on inflation or output realizations as long as the reasoning behind our original assessment of the economic outlook seems sound. In a sense, we have learned the dangers of taking numbers based on estimates and probabilities at face value alone.\n\nEstimates and probabilities bring me to the last conundrum: How you are going to save your children and grandchildren from facing the certain probability that the massive liabilities accumulating to our Medicare and Social Security programs are going to rob them of their futures.\n\nAccording to the latest official U.S. government trustee reports that were released on Monday of this week, the infinite-horizon discounted present value of our unfunded liability from Social Security and Medicare—in common language, the gap between what we will take in and what we have promised to pay—now stands at $88.2 trillion. The potent combination of lower birthrates, higher medical costs and longer life expectancies provides little reason to hope the figure will fall. Last week, I shared my concerns about our long-term liabilities that were based on earlier trustee reports, which tallied the shortfall at $83.9 trillion, a full $4.3 trillion less that this new report suggests.\n\nJust how big is an $88.2 trillion shortfall? Well, it is almost seven times the U.S. gross domestic product. It is more than 100 times the country’s annual defense budget. If you divide the $88.2 trillion evenly among the 302 million U.S. residents, you get a per-person liability of $292,000—more than six times the average household’s annual income. Each of us would have to pay that sum today if we wanted to guarantee the solvency of our entitlement system for future generations.\n\nLet’s explore this $88.2 trillion in a bit more detail.\n\nWe can divvy this liability into four parts. The largest is the $29.8 trillion needed to fund Medicare Part A, which covers hospital stays. Another $27.7 trillion comes from Medicare Part B, which covers doctors’ services. And $17.1 trillion stems from Medicare Part D, the prescription drug benefit that took effect in January of last year. The remaining $13.6 trillion comes from Social Security. What is interesting is the smallest of the four parts is the most debated in Washington. It is yet another example of the old rule that the amount of time spent debating a budget issue in Washington is always inversely proportionate to its cost.\n\nWhen people think about these kinds of issues, they usually assume Social Security is the big problem. As these figures show, the unfunded liability from Medicare Part D alone—the new drug benefit—is greater than the entire Social Security shortfall. Taken together, Medicare’s unfunded liabilities are more than five times Social Security’s.\n\nThe total unfunded liability from Medicare and Social Security encompasses about 7.6 percent of U.S. GDP from here to eternity, which works out to 70 percent of all federal income tax revenues from here to eternity. So instead of paying $292,000 per person now, we could permanently sequester 70 percent of all current and future income tax revenue for use only on Social Security and Medicare. Or we could permanently raise income tax rates by 70 percent to accomplish the same thing—although we’d actually need to jack it up even higher because a large tax hike would probably discourage some people from working.\n\nTo save promised benefits, we would have to dramatically cut spending starting right now or raise income taxes and never bring them back down. And by doing so, we would only be covering the shortfall from Social Security and Medicare payroll tax receipts. All other existing sources of entitlement funding, including payroll tax revenue, copays, deductibles and premiums, would have to remain in place.\n\nThis is not a pretty picture. And as bad as the situation currently is, the necessary response becomes ever more drastic the longer we wait. If past is prologue, the most likely response may be to amend the current system—for example, by raising the retirement age or making the payroll tax more progressive. Many options would improve the fiscal fitness of our entitlement system and reduce the need for drastic action elsewhere in the federal budget. But let’s be honest. These remedies work only because some people would get less than they are currently slated to receive. Painful as that may be, the question is whether other options would be even more difficult.\n\nAt face value, fiscal policy may not seem a concern for the Federal Reserve. After all, Congress holds the power of the purse. But the Fed cannot be an indifferent bystander to the overall thrust of fiscal policy. The reason is straightforward: Bad fiscal policy creates pressure for bad monetary policy. When fiscal policy gets out of whack, monetary authorities face pressure to monetize the debt, a cardinal sin in my mind.\n\nThe Fed is not the answer to our fiscal woes. Congress, as keeper of the government’s purse and the sole body with the power to tax and spend the people’s money, and the president, who approves their spending, are where the buck should stop. But here is the rub: Voters like you elect the Congress and the president. History may place blame on this or that president or on Congress for failing to act. Ultimately, though, the responsibility for solving this looming fiscal issue rests with you, the voter.\n\nYou may remember my mention of Josiah Stamp earlier. If you don’t figure out a way to get your elected representatives to come to grips with the overwhelming problem of Medicare, your heirs may well end up like Josiah Stamp’s. Stamp refused to evacuate his stately home during Hitler’s bombings of London. He and his eldest son, Wilfred, were killed by a bomb in 1941. Well, under prevailing British law, in the event one could not determine who in the line of succession died first, it would be presumed that the eldest did. Thus, legally, Wilfred momentarily inherited his father’s peerage. Despite dying together, the Treasury levied the estate tax twice: once on the occasion of Papa Stamp’s death, then again immediately afterward upon Wilfred Stamp’s death.\n\nIf you don’t get your leaders to focus on solutions that cover the unfunded liability of these entitlement programs, you will be faced with a Hobson’s choice between a Federal Reserve that reneges on its most solemn duty and government tax measures far more drastic than ever occurred to the hapless Stamp family.\n\nThe Fed will not monetize our government’s debts. So you are left with the people you elect to represent you in Washington. In the end, that means you must turn to the person you look at every day in the mirror—you.\n\nThis is not a case where time heals all wounds. Indeed, it is the exact opposite. Time, in the case of our long-term unfunded liabilities, wounds all heels. And you and your children and your children’s children will be the heels who are wounded unless you demand that something be done about it.\n\nWell, Luther, I am not sure that happy ending will put a spring in your step as you retreat to luncheon. Here is the point: Despite the constant changes occurring in the way the world is economically geared and measured, despite the imperfection of the data, and despite the ebb and flow of political tides, the Federal Reserve does its level best to get things right.\n\nWhen I was invited to enter what some call “The Temple” of the Fed, Chairman Greenspan sat me down and told me that I only have one duty here and that is to pursue the truth. It is a great privilege to work for an institution that is so true to its purpose.\n\nAnd Luther, maybe, just maybe, when all is said and done, my colleagues and I will be able to execute our mission with the same accomplishment and grace and humility with which you and Teresa have built your legacy in Fort Worth and in the investment community at large.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "April 19, 2007 Dallas, Texas\n\n[\n1\n]\n\nI hope I said that better than when our family arrived in Tokyo in 1990 and my son James promptly spoke his first Japanese words:\n\n,\n\nwhich turned out to mean: “My dog has a very long snout.”\n\nDomo. Thank you, Sylvia. Thank you, Curtis. Thank you all. Thank you for honoring me with the Sun & Star Legacy Award. I am most grateful to the Japan-America Society for this honor. I am especially honored to receive this award in the presence of Kamo-san, a fine representative of the government of Japan. And I am delighted to have witnessed the presentation of the Bridges to Friendship Award to my buddy, Ron Kirk.\n\nRon and I share two things in common. We both took leave of our better senses—or did not listen to our better sensei—and ran for the U.S. Senate. We joined a long line of others, Democrats and Republicans, who learned the meaning of the Latin phrase, Veni, Vidi, Defici: I came, I saw, I lost.\n\nAnd much more important than all that, we both married smart, beautiful women. I am happy to see Ron here tonight. I am even happier to see Matrice, one of the best and brightest and most beautiful women on God’s green Earth. (Nancy is at a meeting in Boston tonight, so I can get away with that one.)\n\nI love Japan.\n\nIn 1990, Nancy and I packed our bags and our four kids and, with the assistance of the Japan Society and the Nomura Research Institute, went off to live in Tokyo to learn more about the Land of the Rising Sun. We tackled it with full-bore enthusiasm, doing our best to be as Japanese—and as non-gaijin—as possible. We traveled everywhere, ate things most Americans wouldn’t want to know about, and drank a lot of sake and good Japanese beer.\n\nWe even worked on a rice farm and a pear farm. The Japanese farmer I worked for felt that bees “were too random,” so he had scores of women—and me—climbing ladders carrying bags of pollen, which we carefully brushed onto each blossom of every pear tree on his farm. It was quintessentially Japanese.\n\nIn preparation for that adventure, I read all the requisite literature then in vogue: Professor Reischauer’s works; books by Robert Whiting, particularly The Chrysanthemum and the Bat; Murasaki Shikibu’s The Tale of Genji—the translated version, of course. I read Karel van Wolferen’s The Enigma of Japanese Power, Robert Christopher’s The Japanese Mind and several Japanese novels, like The Temple of the Golden Pavilion and Tanizaki’s Naomi. My favorite was Natsume Soseki’s Kokoro. Loosely translated, the word kokoro means “the heart of things.”\n\nLet me get to the heart of things; to why I love Japan.\n\nThe story of Japan reaffirms faith in the power of man- and womankind to regenerate, to overcome bad decisions or bad luck or outright defeat. If you know the history of Japan, you can’t help but believe in resurrection. Robert Christopher, whom I just mentioned, arrived in Tokyo just a few days after General MacArthur accepted Japan’s surrender on the decks of the Missouri. Here is what he wrote:\n\nJapan serves as a reminder that cynics and even the most highly regarded pundits and thoughtful prognosticators can be dead wrong when it comes to evaluating the spirit and resilience of mankind. After the war, the Western press assigned Japan to the dustbin of history.\n\nMy friends here know that I am a devotee of The New York Times. I read it every morning without fail—after reading The Dallas Morning News, of course—even though its motto “All the News That’s Fit to Print” occasionally comes closer to “All the News That’s Fit to Tint.” Here is what a Sunday New York Times had to say about the Japanese economy in 1945: “It is not likely to expand sharply….The prospect [is for] a return to Japan’s status as a small, self-contained nation.”\n\nHow myopic they were. Despite the Times’ prognostication, Japan became the second largest and most prosperous economy in the world, eventually impacting every consumer on the planet. Among its many accomplishments that affect our daily lives, Japan makes the finest automobiles the world has ever known (the guys here tonight from Toyota paid me to say that). Its culinary tradition is a favorite of the elites of all American and European capitals. Japan has given mind-boggling technologies to consumers around the world—although those ubiquitous household toilets that only a NASA scientist can operate have yet to make much of a splash on this side of the Pacific.\n\nFrom the rubble, from the “melancholy and horrifying landscape” described by Robert Christopher, a great and important economic machine arose and a great and important culture was resurrected.\n\nFor these and many other reasons, Japan has been a source of constant fascination to me. After that first experience in 1990, I spent a great deal of time there. In 1998, I was assigned by the president of the United States to cochair the U.S.–Japan Enhanced Initiative on Deregulation and Competition Policy, which he and Prime Minister Hashimoto had cooked up and which met countless times and allowed me to deepen my understanding of Japan and the Japanese.\n\nThe one thing that is so engrossing about Japan is that the more you experience it, the less you know about it. Every time I began to think I had it figured out, I’d realize that I was only just beginning to understand it.\n\nLet me share with you a metaphorical incident that puts it all in perspective.\n\nAs Curtis mentioned, in the spring of 1990, our son Anders, then 13, became the second non-Japanese boy in history to play in the Tokyo Senior Boys Baseball League, on a team named the Minato Moose, so that he could learn the meaning of wa, or team spirit.\n\nIn Texas, he was considered a fine ballplayer. But in Tokyo, where junior high and high school boys throw 90-mile-per-hour fastballs like clockwork and the pro teams begin recruiting 13-year-olds, he had to work himself almost to death to make the team.\n\nHe came home one night from tryouts at around 10 o’clock. Having passed what was known as the “thousand grounder test”—an infield drill where you field grounders until either you have caught what seems a thousand of them or your hands bleed or swell up so as to be useless—he had made the team. He had his league patch, his number and two Japanese characters that were to be sewn on his uniform before he went off to play a game at 8 o’clock the next morning in Yokohama. He proudly handed them to us and fell onto his tatami mat, asleep within seconds.\n\nWell, at 10 at night, Nancy and I had no choice but to sew the patches on ourselves. We borrowed a needle from a kindly neighbor, but she didn’t have any thread that matched Anders’ uniform. So I spent the entire night painstakingly pulling thread out of a dress of Nancy’s that was the same color, while she sewed the patch, the numeral and, most importantly, the two characters that stood for Minato Moose on the front of his uniform.\n\nWhen Anders awoke, we proudly presented him with his uniform, gave him his obento box—full, incidentally, of peanut butter sandwiches that Nancy had exquisitely sculpted to resemble the sushi pieces his teammates had in their obento boxes, it being hard for an American boy to eat squid during a baseball game—and sent him off to the team bus headed for his first ballgame as a member of the Minato Moose.\n\nThat night, at the appointed hour, the door to our apartment flung open, Anders walked in, threw his glove down and burst into tears. Before we could say “How did it go, son?” he looked at us in horror and said, “Mom, Dad: You sewed the characters on upside down.”\n\nOver the past 17 years, my family and I have tried hard to develop an understanding of Japan. I admire the country. I love Japanese culture. I have the greatest respect for the Japanese people. Tonight you have made me very proud to be recognized for trying to do so, even if I occasionally get things upside down.\n\nDomo arigato gozaimasu. Thank you so much.",

            "content": "April 16, 2007 Irving, Texas\n\nThank you, Ken [Bentsen]. You and your family have rendered great service to Texas in both chambers of the United States Congress. I held your uncle, Lloyd, in the highest regard, as I do you. And I especially appreciated the support you always gave to us on trade issues when I was deputy U.S. trade representative and you were serving the 25th District in the House of Representatives. You supported fast-track authority, Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, and many other trade initiatives that were not necessarily the most popular within your party at the time. That took courage.\n\nI am going to speak today—the day before you file your 2006 returns with the IRS—about fiscal policy, an area into which central bankers rarely wander. The idea for this speech came to me when I saw a recent rerun of From Here to Eternity, the film classic based on James Jones’ great novel about Pearl Harbor. It won eight Academy Awards in 1953 and is perhaps best remembered for that steamy scene of Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr frolicking in the surf.\n\nKen, I want to say right up front that I was not thinking of your former employer here. I realize that in citing this great film, some film buff in the audience might remember that Donna Reed won an Oscar for Eternity by playing a “hostess” in an establishment cleverly named the New Congress Club—a reference to a different kind of congress. Instead, I was thinking of the longer-term picture of our nation’s fiscal predicament, something that cannot fail to escape the attention of any Federal Reserve official looking down the field for issues that could prove especially vexing for central bankers charged with keeping inflation at bay.\n\nLet me explain. But first, let me make clear, as I always do, that I speak only for myself today and not for others at the Fed or for my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nJust 15 years ago, our country confronted a record peacetime federal budget deficit of $290 billion. People of goodwill from both sides of our political spectrum got together and realized that deficits of this magnitude threatened the U.S. economy’s long-term health. They made tough choices, and through a combination of fiscal prudence and strong economic growth, decades of deficits gave way to a remarkable $239 billion surplus in the year 2000.\n\nIn 2007, we again face a $200 billion deficit. Once again, people of goodwill are pledging to achieve a surplus by 2012. Indeed, the president’s proposed 2008 federal budget envisions a gradual reduction in deficit spending from $244 billion this year to $187 billion in 2009 to $54 billion in 2011. In 2012, the federal budget would return to surplus, albeit a more modest one than was achieved seven years ago.\n\nOf course, every economic forecast is based on assumptions. The good news is the macroeconomic forecasts behind that five-year march toward fiscal balance are actually quite reasonable—3 percent real annual GDP growth between now and 2012, coupled with a 4.8 percent unemployment rate. But the promise of a disappearing deficit rests on another important assumption we should discuss in greater detail—that real spending growth will be held to a 0.4 percent annual rate, which is quite low by historical standards.\n\nIf you reckon that in fiscal matters, past is often prologue, then a good way to determine what will happen in the future is to look to the past.\n\nBefore doing so, let me remind you that the Federal Reserve is a strictly nonpartisan institution; when you enter the temple of the Federal Reserve, you check your partisan affiliation at the door. But you don’t check your sense of humor, which is why a story told widely by George Shultz, the great Republican public servant, comes to mind. When he was director of President Nixon’s Office of Management and Budget, he became worried about the amount of money Congress was proposing to spend. After some nights of tossing and turning, he called legendary staffer Sam Cohen into his office. Cohen had a long memory of budget matters and knew every zig and zag of budget history. “Sam,” Shultz asked, “tell me something just between you and me. Is there any difference between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to spending money?” Cohen looked at him, furrowed his brow, and after thinking about it, replied, “Mr. Shultz, there is only one difference: Democrats enjoy it more.”\n\nI can’t vouch for anyone’s particular sense of enjoyment, nor should I as a Federal Reserve official. I think it best to stick to an analytical, “just the facts, ma’am” approach.\n\nSo what are the facts? What has the federal spending picture looked like in recent years? As you can see on the slide, real outlays from 2001 to the present have grown at an annual rate of 4.6 percent. By contrast, they grew at a 2 percent to 3 percent rate during the years Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan were in office, about 1.5 percent during Bush 41’s tenure and 0.8 percent in the Clinton years. You notice that I refer to the presidents under whom this spending occurred. It is important to remember that it takes two branches of government to tango on budget matters: the executive proposes, and the legislative disposes. Congress has the final say on all budget matters.\n\n\n\nTo some extent, these different growth rates reflect different circumstances. The Clinton years, for example, reaped the benefits of the post-Cold War peace dividend, whereas today’s policymakers have been called upon to wage the war on terror. It is clear that defense spending has been responsible for much of the budget’s deterioration. Real yearly defense outlays have grown by almost 10 percent in the wake of 9/11, reversing the steady decline since the end of the Cold War.\n\nNondefense outlays have also risen rapidly in the wake of 9/11, and for reasons not obviously related to national security. These expenditures have grown at a real annual rate of 3.5 percent over the past six years, the fastest sustained rate of the post-World War II era. I do not mean to suggest that any particular person or policymaker is responsible for this increase, but the fact is, the increase has occurred.\n\nUsing the past as our guide, let’s consider just how bad the deficit picture could become. If we replace the 0.4 percent spending-growth assumption in the proposed budget with the 4.6 percent rate that has thus far prevailed in the 21st century, the $61 billion surplus projected for 2012 turns into a $701 billion deficit. That’s a big number. To be fair, it is probably too big because it assumes that the rapid post-9/11 defense buildup will continue apace. It is perhaps more reasonable to assume that the central tendency of real annual spending growth between now and 2012 will more closely resemble the post-Vietnam War historical average of 2.3 percent. With this assumption, the 2012 deficit would be $231 billion—about as large as the one we face today.\n\nOur national leaders are considering other fiscal reforms that could have a big impact on the deficit picture. Since tomorrow is Tax Day, let’s start with the alternative minimum tax. The AMT is a “backup” income tax code put in place more than a generation ago to ensure every high-income household paid taxes. AMT rates are somewhat lower and flatter than ordinary income tax rates but without many common deductions, such as state and local taxes. We taxpayers must separately compute our liabilities under each tax scheme and pay the higher of the two obligations.\n\nOnly 20,000 people paid AMT in 1970. Less than 40 years later, 3.5 million households have been swept into the AMT net. If no action is taken, an estimated 20 million households will join them this year, and some 15 million more will be added to the ATM rolls by 2012.\n\nWhy the big jump this year? The answer—as is so often the case in the world of central banking—comes down to inflation. AMT brackets don’t rise as price levels change or the economy grows, so over time, bracket creep pushes more and more people onto the AMT. A series of temporary patches has held the inflation component at bay. The relief has now expired, causing that 20 million-household jump.\n\nA consensus seems to have formed around the proposition that we should stop this from happening by extending the patches and permanently indexing the AMT for inflation. Such a change would substantially slow the march of households toward the AMT—but it would be a very expensive proposition. If tax cuts approved in 2001 and 2003 are made permanent, the AMT would cost the Treasury an estimated $945 billion over the next 10 years.\n\nIf the tax cuts aren’t made permanent, AMT reform could be done more cheaply. That $945 billion tab could be reduced to $520 billion because fewer people would have to pay the AMT. Of course, the flip side of that picture is that households would pay more in taxes as other tax cuts on income also expire, using money that might otherwise have been spent on cars, furniture and travel. And, sure enough, a Treasury Department study finds that future economic activity might fall modestly if the tax cuts lapse. As is so often the case in the policy arena, every choice has its costs and its benefits. No easy solution is in sight.\n\nIn some respects, however, talking about near-term fiscal issues like the AMT and the tax cuts misses the bigger problem. These are issues we can likely—or at least conceivably—weather. The longer-term issue of entitlements is the more serious fiscal problem, with more significant potential consequences for the economy.\n\nAccording to official government trustee reports, the infinite-horizon discounted present value of our unfunded liability from Social Security and Medicare—in common language, the gap between what we will take in and what we have promised to pay—now stands at $83.9 trillion. The potent combination of lower birthrates, higher medical costs and longer life expectancies provides little reason to hope that the figure will fall.\n\nJust how big is an $83.9 trillion shortfall? Well, it is six times the U.S. gross domestic product. It is more than 100 times the country’s annual defense budget. And it is about 10,000 times the annual budget of the Environmental Protection Agency. That is a lot of money, even for a central banker.\n\nLet’s explore this $83.9 trillion in a bit more detail (see slide). As you will see, the largest portion of the liability is the $28.1 trillion needed to fund Medicare Part A, which covers hospital stays. Another $26.2 trillion comes from Medicare Part B, which covers doctors’ services. And $16.2 trillion stems from Medicare Part D, the prescription drug benefit that took effect in January of last year. Finally, $13.4 trillion comes from Social Security, the topic of reform debate among Congress, the president and others in recent years. It is yet another example of the old rule that the amount of time spent debating a budget issue in Washington is always inversely proportionate to its cost.\n\n\n\nWhen people think about these kinds of issues, they usually assume Social Security is the big problem. But, by golly, it isn’t. As these figures show, the unfunded liability from Medicare Part D alone—the drug benefit—is greater than the entire Social Security shortfall. Taken together, Medicare’s unfunded liabilities are more than five times that of Social Security. So while we can applaud policymakers who have tried to shore up Social Security, we must be ever mindful that the lion’s share of the total $83.9 trillion unfunded liability problem will remain even if they succeed.\n\nBut we’re a big country, so let’s look at it on a per-person basis. If you divide the $83.9 trillion evenly among the 300 million U.S. residents, you get a per-person liability of $280,000—more than five times the average household’s annual income. Each of us would have to pay that much today if we wanted to guarantee the solvency of our entitlement system for future generations.\n\nLet me put it yet another way. The total unfunded liability from these programs encompasses about 7.5 percent of U.S. GDP from here to eternity, which works out to 68 percent of all federal income tax revenues from here to eternity. So instead of paying $280,000 per person now, we could permanently sequester 68 percent of all current and future income tax revenue for use only on Social Security and Medicare. Or we could permanently raise income tax rates by 68 percent to accomplish the same thing—although we’d actually need to jack it up even higher because a large tax hike would probably discourage some people from working.\n\nNow that I have your attention, remember that to save promised benefits, we would have to dramatically cut spending starting right now or raise income taxes and never bring them back down. And by doing so, we would only be covering the shortfall from Social Security and Medicare payroll tax receipts. All other existing sources of entitlement funding, including payroll tax revenue, copays, deductibles and premiums, would have to remain in place.\n\nThis is not a pretty picture. And as bad as the situation currently is, the necessary response becomes ever more drastic the longer we wait. If past is prologue, the most likely response may be to adjust the parameters of the current system—for example, by raising the retirement age or making the payroll tax more progressive. Many options would improve the fiscal fitness of our entitlement system and reduce the need for drastic action elsewhere in the federal budget. But let’s be honest: Any option would work only because some people would get less than they are currently slated to receive. Painful as that is, the question is whether other options on the table would be even more so.\n\nOur short-term fiscal challenges are significant as we grope our way toward a future in which we begin to pay down the federal debt. The long-term challenge of entitlements is much more severe, with implications both for our own well-being and for the long-term strength of the global economy. Yes, we remain the biggest player on the global stage, but if we fail to get our fiscal house in order, we could bequeath our descendants unconscionable debt and slow the global economy to boot. Is that to be our legacy?\n\nAt face value, fiscal policy may not seem a concern for the Federal Reserve. Taxing and spending, after all, are not the Fed’s business. Congress holds the power of the purse. But the Fed cannot be an indifferent bystander to the overall thrust of fiscal policy. The reason is straightforward: Bad fiscal policy creates pressure for bad monetary policy. When fiscal policy gets out of whack, monetary authorities face pressure to monetize the debt, a cardinal sin in my mind.\n\nI have spoken in previous speeches of our “faith-based currency,” a term I use only slightly tongue in cheek. The dollar—like the euro, the yen, the British pound and other currencies—is what economists call a fiat currency. It is backed only by the federal government’s power to raise the revenues needed to meet its obligations and by the rectitude of the U.S. central bank. If the market were to lose faith in either assumption, the dollar would be debased.\n\nThe Fed is not the answer to our fiscal woes. Remember, the executive proposes, and the legislative disposes. Congress, as keeper of the government’s purse and the sole body with the power to tax and spend the people’s money, is where the buck stops. Congress has the duty and the means to impose solutions to these imbalances, hopefully inspired by presidential leadership. And here is the rub: Voters like you elect the Congress. And you elect the president. You might chuckle at Sam Cohen’s answer to George Shultz’s question, but this is no laughing matter. Just as in the film From Here to Eternity, the lives of the cast of citizens of this great country are going to be dramatically altered by a calamitous development. The difference is that this one will come as no surprise; it is of our own making, and it is within our power to prevent. While we frolic in the surf of immediate economic prosperity and are consumed with all sorts of other political and economic melodramas and intrigues, we are being threatened not from some foreign enemy but from within.\n\nHistory may place blame on this or that president or on Congress for failing to act. But, ultimately, the responsibility to solve these looming fiscal issues rests with voters. In the end, the person who is responsible for the $83.9 trillion meltdown that is happening before our very eyes—the person responsible for saddling each of your children and every other person you love with $280,000 in debt—is the one you look at in the mirror each morning.\n\nThank you and have a nice Tax Day.",

            "content": "April 13, 2007 Houston, Texas\n\nWhen addressing an audience, it is customary for Federal Reserve officials to declare that they speak only for themselves and not for any other senior officials at the Fed, nor for any colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee. That will be true today with one exception: I speak for everyone at the Federal Reserve in stating an admiration for the dynamism and spirit of this great city. Thank you for inviting me to this meeting of the Houston World Affairs Council.\n\nI am going to talk to you today about globalization. This is a trendy word these days, and I have no doubt that I am not the first person to address the topic of globalization before this august group. I doubt I am even the 10th or the 20th speaker from whose lips you have heard that now ubiquitous word.\n\nBut today, I am going to do something so shocking and rare that you may actually gasp in amazement: I am going to quote a French politician. And I am going to quote him approvingly, with apologies in advance that by doing so I might damage his presidential campaign.\n\nLast November, the Financial Times quoted Nicolas Sarkozy offering the French electorate a distinctly politically incorrect dose of reality. “Globalization is a fact,” Sarkozy said. “It would be as pointless to deny it or oppose it as to challenge the law of gravity or to stop the movement of the clouds. The question therefore is not whether globalization is good or bad. It is whether we are prepared for it.”\n\nI could not agree more. While it may be cathartic or politically convenient to cast negative aspersions on globalization, it is a futile exercise. We have passed the point of no return in the intermingling of the world’s economies. It is now a given. Mr. Sarkozy asks the right question: Are we prepared for it?\n\nThe economic impact of globalization is the topic of the Dallas Fed’s 2006 annual report essay, titled “The Best of All Worlds,” which we are releasing to the public today—as soon as I finish this speech. You will be the first to have it. Please take it home and read the essay written by Michael Cox and Richard Alm, two of the Dallas Fed’s best and most eloquent minds.\n\nThe essay points out that the simultaneous opening up of the world economy—especially the integration of markets due to the telecommunications revolution and the development of cyberspace—has changed the way every entrepreneur, every manager, and every business woman and man in America contemplates their cost of goods sold and the markets they sell to as they navigate into the future.\n\nThe essay explores 10 ways globalization raises productivity and reduces costs. I am going to summarize them for you. But first, let me set the stage with a story about a good friend of mine named Dr. Jonathan Weissler, who holds the chair in pulmonary research named for my late, great father-in-law, Jim Collins, at the University of Texas Southwestern University Hospitals in Dallas, where Dr. Weissler is chief of medicine.\n\nWhen Dr. Weissler sees a patient, he, like most doctors, dictates examination notes into a recorder so that the information can be transcribed into the patient’s file. Nothing startling there; this has been standard medical practice for decades. What is new—and a hallmark of what we call the Knowledge Economy—is that instead of paying an on-site employee at UT Southwestern to transcribe his dictation, he sends the recording electronically to a company that farms the work out to English speakers around the world to transcribe overnight. They type up the notes for a fraction of the cost while Dr. Weissler sleeps. And voilà, they are on the good doctor’s desktop the next morning.\n\nIncidentally, Dr. Weissler says he can tell when the transcripts are produced in India because the English is perfect and even the most complex medical terms are spelled correctly—a testimony to the Indian ability to teach the blocking and tackling of proper English in their schools.\n\nBy reducing costs and streamlining his recordkeeping in this way, Weissler’s practice runs more efficiently and his staff can devote more time to serving patients. The real payoff is that the money saved can be reinvested into researching new ways to save and improve lives.\n\nDr. Weissler is more than prepared for globalization. Rather than cower before it, he is harnessing it. He is availing himself of resources created by the spread of knowledge around the world in order to save money and run an efficient operation. Therein lies an American-style answer to Monsieur Sarkozy’s pithy question.\n\nTo some this is alarming—especially those who focus on jobs lost to globalization, like the ones held by Texans and other Americans who once transcribed those notes for Dr. Weissler. Dwelling on these lost jobs or outsourced tasks ignores lessons of history. To be sure, we cannot and should not ignore the painful adjustments that economic advancement inflicts upon displaced workers; we should never underestimate the human costs of the process known to economists as creative destruction, a term coined by the iconic economist Joseph Schumpeter in 1942.\n\nI grew up in a household where my father suffered more than his fair share of the destructive side of that process. It was difficult for him to grasp the allure of the “creative” side of the equation, and I am more familiar with the anguish that comes when a breadwinner loses his job than I would like to be. But I consider it a fool’s errand to seek to somehow stop the momentum of globalization, particularly when one considers that jobs lost to globalization pale in comparison to jobs lost to the steady march of technological progress. I rarely hear the speakers who cast invective upon “globalization” also decry the evils of new technologies and innovation.\n\nIt is the job of our political leaders to provide a bridging mechanism for people like my dear old dad—God rest his hardworking soul—that mitigates the destruction without hindering the creative side of Schumpeter’s phenomenon.\n\nAmerican entrepreneurs and workers have developed a mastery of creative destruction—albeit with fits and starts—over the past 200 years. Our $13 trillion economy—the world’s biggest, by far—is proof that we can adapt to new circumstances and profit from the benefits those circumstances provide. To be prepared for globalization—to harness it and ride it to continued prosperity—we must remain at the forefront of the Information Age. We must master the Knowledge Economy.\n\nThe lesson of the essay is that globalization is spreading the Knowledge Economy around the globe—and the Knowledge Economy is accelerating the pace of globalization. While globalization itself is not new, it has gathered intensity over the past decade or so because of technologies that make it cheaper and easier to move information to nearly all corners of the world.\n\nWe have had decades to contemplate globalization in goods—many of which come through the Port of Houston—that were produced by cheap labor and abundant resources in faraway lands like China. But globalization has spread beyond manufactured goods to other segments of the economy, rapidly moving up the value-added ladder. Computers, the Internet, high-capacity fiber-optic cables and other marvels of modern communications fuel the extension of international competition into a broad realm of the economy that had been largely isolated from it. I am referring, of course, to the globalization of the services sector.\n\nMany services are still untouched by globalization. It remains impractical, for example, for a Houstonian to enjoy the pristine sushi freshly made by the dockside chefs who work around Tokyo’s Tsukiji fish market, or to import the services of a barber who lives in Seville—sorry, I couldn’t resist that one. But many more services from all parts of the world can be delivered here in the blink of an eye (or in 40 winks of Dr. Weissler's eye overnight), thanks to the revolution in communication technologies that allow knowledge to overcome traditional impediments of distance.\n\nDr. Weissler shows us how some of the medical profession’s common support services have been globalized. Yet, his example is but the tip of the iceberg of the ways we can stretch the boundaries of high-skilled services. In 2001, a surgeon in New York, using robotic tools, removed the gallbladder of a patient 3,870 miles away in the French city of Strasbourg. In 2005, a laptop computer in Boston guided instruments as they performed heart surgery—unaided by human hands—on a patient in Milan, Italy. Geographic boundaries and technological impediments are evaporating even at the far reaches of the value-added realm.\n\nIt is trends like these that inspired us at the Dallas Fed to unleash Michael Cox and Rick Alm and our other researchers to consider the ways globalization is changing our economy.\n\nHere are the 10 ways in which globalization now impacts the Knowledge Economy. We have found that globalization lowers communication and transportation costs, point No. 1; fuels competition, point No. 2; and encourages specialization, point No. 3. A firm can now access labor, raw materials and other resources at any time and from anywhere on the globe, resulting in point No. 4: improved production functions.\n\nProducers can sell their goods and services to a larger market, No. 5, and extend their economies of scale, No. 6, by producing to satisfy global, not just domestic, demand.\n\nPoint No. 7, capital markets expand, freeing money to seek the highest return available globally and to fund development of new production capacity anywhere on the planet.\n\nPoint 8, knowledge spreads across towns, industries and countries, fueled by migration, the Internet, cell phones and trade.\n\nGlobalization erodes national or natural monopoly power, making markets more accessible to competition and more fair to consumers—or in other words, more “contestable,” point 9. And finally, increased production leads to increased consumption without reducing the amount available for others to consume, point 10. Just because I’m downloading the most recent episode of 24 from iTunes does not mean someone in Norway cannot download it, too.\n\nThe common thread among these 10 factors is that they all raise productivity’s level or its growth rate—or both. Higher productivity lowers costs. Lower costs restrain inflation, the bête noire of any progressive economy and the bane of Federal Reserve officials and central bankers everywhere. In this fundamental way, globalization raises the economy’s speed limit, allowing policymakers to relax a little and let the economy expand at rates that might once have been considered unsustainable. In a globalized world, faster growth need not carry the same inflationary implications it does in a closed world.\n\nThe Fed’s mandate calls for keeping inflation low while maintaining maximum sustainable economic growth—a duty we cannot fulfill without weighing productivity. Getting more output from existing labor and capital allows the economy to grow faster without igniting price pressures. We saw this vividly, for example, in the 1990s, when the IT revolution led to surging productivity, lower costs and faster growth. The Fed understood that increased supplies of goods and services, not inflationary excess demand, fueled the expansion, and it wisely let the economy seek a higher growth rate.\n\nConsidering all the dynamics of our globalized world, one problem monetary policymakers have is that we find ourselves lacking proper measuring sticks to capture these intangible dynamics. When a Boston doctor operates remotely on a patient in Milan, should we credit it to the U.S. economy or the Italian economy? A Barbie doll is designed in America and assembled in Malaysia from Taiwanese plastic pellets, Chinese cloth and Japanese nylon. Is the doll American or Malaysian or something else? When people in the U.S. and other countries can work together so seamlessly, how can we pull them apart with the data? Our annual report underscores how the world is fast becoming one big integrated economy, which suggests we should care as much about foreign output gaps, capacity utilization rates and unemployment rates as we do about our own.\n\nTraditional economic doctrine does not recognize the importance of foreign output to a country’s inflation rate. Only domestic output matters. But a new economic model, produced by the Dallas Fed, allows us to show that foreign output also matters. For central bankers, getting policy right will involve analyzing a great deal of additional data and overcoming blind spots about what’s going on in key parts of the world. We don’t, for example, know as much as we’d like about China’s capital stock, work hours and rural unemployment. We have no reliable estimates of the productive capacity in Brazil, India and Russia. All the data shortcomings are maddening, but they aren’t reason enough to deny the fundamental fact that globalization is changing the way our economies work.\n\nData that do not reflect the world in which we live increase the chances for errors in judgment. We need to develop much better measures for the global economy, particularly as services are increasingly traded. Today, our most detailed measures pertain to goods, a proportionally shrinking segment of our economy. We can tell you about agriculture and manufacturing in excruciating detail but have relatively little data about our fast-growing services sector—now 82 percent of U.S. employment. We have even less data on the global services economy.\n\nGlobalization doesn’t just drive down costs. It advances living standards in ways not captured by the standard economic measures of progress. We need new and better tools to help us determine just how globalization is affecting economies around the world, and how policymakers can reap benefits from these insights. Getting it right may well alter our notions of economic progress, with ramifications for how we approach the goal of price stability.\n\nThe Dallas Fed is hard at work researching this issue. We are in the process of establishing the Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute, and our economic research team—the same people who inform our Bank’s participation in the Federal Open Market Committee—is focused with laserlike intensity on advancing our knowledge of these underresearched and poorly understood phenomena.\n\nI hope that our annual report will give you insight into how the operators of our economy—men and women like yourselves who keep our mighty economic machine humming—address the Sarkozy Challenge. Are we prepared for globalization? The answer is in your hands.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "April 4, 2007 Austin, Texas\n\nPerceptions of risk lie in the eye of the beholder. Some see risk as a powerful force vital to capitalism; others consider it a four-letter word. The latter view may be gaining currency these days, with reports of risk coming home to roost in housing finance. Temporary problems in one industry, however, should not detract from the essential value of, need for and virtues of risk taking. We must be constantly mindful that prudent risk taking is the lifeblood of capitalism, and it is indeed a many splendored thing. If we had not taken risks, we would never have created from scratch the $13 trillion U.S. economy, the greatest economic machine in the history of the planet.\n\nEver since our ancestors decided that life was anything but predestined by supreme forces beyond their control, we have taken risks to advance our interests as we navigate our way toward the future. A young person who goes to college, for example, risks the certain income from today’s job, believing in the probability of a better paying one after graduation. Once we are in the workforce, life insurance hedges the risk that we might die before we have socked away enough money to provide for our families. As we accumulate excess savings, we place them at risk by investing in stocks and bonds to secure our retirement. We take risks by borrowing to finance our homes and our businesses, with the expectation that a brighter future will enable us to repay our debts and then some.\n\nThe impulse for risk gives rise to agents to service it, like the good people assembled in this room. Banks, insurance companies, investment banks, money managers, hedge funds and other financial intermediaries provide the means to package and distribute risk. In the old days, their job was fairly straightforward. The agents packaged straight-up risk instruments like letters of credit, banker's acceptances, commercial paper, simple loans and stocks, and fixed-rate mortgages. Today, assisted by technology and computational power that can assess probabilities faster than you can say “Keep Austin Weird,” financial intermediaries offer products to satisfy almost any risk taker’s needs.\n\nIn contemplating the present situation of our economy, one can easily become confused and distracted by the enormous array of risk instruments now available and by trying to figure out where the buck really stops. In sorting through it all, I find it helpful to bear in mind certain patterns that reemerge throughout history—patterns that are imprinted in human nature, independent of advances in financial sophistication. I would like to remind you of them today.\n\nThe views I am about to express, as always, are my own and not those of any other participant in the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve. They are conditioned by personal experience.\n\nA substantial part of my personal experience involved spending some 20-odd years as a professional investor and hedge-fund manager pursuing the time-honored goal of buying a dollar’s worth of underlying value with nickels and dimes invested in publicly traded securities, including those of distressed banks, thrifts and other financial institutions in the aftermath of the 1980s. As mentioned in Bernie’s introduction, my partners and I succeeded in those endeavors more often than not, but that is not the point. The point is that I have experienced the process of risk taking as a market operator—the upside and the downside—at the microlevel, not just as a macroeconomic analyst.\n\nAnd yet, I am now the beneficiary of the collective knowledge of the Dallas Fed’s bank supervisors and analysts—those battle-hardened souls who navigated their way through Texas’ savings and loan, banking and real estate crises of the 1980s.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the following is one man’s perspective on the current scene.\n\nFirst, a little not-terribly-ancient history. In the 1980s, the euphoria of oil prices approaching $80 a barrel in today’s dollars led to a frenzy of lending activity in the Eleventh Federal Reserve District. At least I think that’s what any reasonable observer would call the annual growth rate of business loans of over 40 percent at Texas banks and annual growth in commercial real estate lending of almost 50 percent that we saw in the early part of that decade. Booking assets at such a rapid clip has a \"come hither\" seductive power. In pursuit of a seemingly sure thing, more than 550 new banks were chartered in Texas from 1980 through 1985. This made for a volatile brew, combining dramatic rates of growth in activity with a dramatic expansion of the number of players with limited experience in navigating a reversal of fate, or what econometricians call a reversion to the mean. The assumption of permanently high—or permanently rising—prices in an asset class—in this case, oil—invariably leads to regrettable decisions.\n\nYou recall what ensued. By early 1981, reversion to the mean had begun. Real oil prices began to fall, contributing to an economic slowdown in the region’s most energy-sensitive areas, such as Houston. The regional economy held its own for a while, propelled by a red-hot commercial real estate sector. The state economy suffered a severe decline when oil collapsed to the current equivalent of $17 per barrel by mid-1986. Bank and thrift failures reached a frightful magnitude. More than 800 financial institutions went out of business in Texas during the 1980s and into the early 1990s. Nine of the 10 largest banking organizations based in Texas didn’t make it.\n\nThe energy bust reverberated through Texas, and it was keenly felt in both commercial and residential real estate markets. Office vacancies soared. In Dallas and Houston, they hovered around 30 percent, and they approached 40 percent here in Austin. Troubles in the residential sector got so bad that the city of Garland, a Dallas suburb, authorized a condo development project interrupted by the collapsed market to be set on fire; burning it to the ground seemed the best choice for the 240 unfinished condos that had become eyesores and safety hazards in the twinkle of a financial cycle’s eye.\n\nThat is pretty bracing stuff, but quickly forgotten when one looks around this state two decades later and sees a booming economy and rapid employment growth. Texas is attracting corporate headquarters and new citizens like bees to honey, is now the largest exporting state, is pumping on all economic cylinders, and is even having nice things written about its museums and restaurants in The New York Times. And the Houston and Austin and Dallas commercial real estate markets are hotter than Scarlett Johansson. Yet we mustn’t forget the dangers of miscalculating risk and the pain of corrections.\n\nTo be sure, we have made significant strides since the 1980s. Information technology has greatly improved the ability to measure and calibrate risk. The banking industry has taken advantage of the technology with its value-at-risk measurement and the formal statistical models that are the essence of the proposed Basel II bank capital requirements. It is now possible to mitigate risk through securitization and the use of derivative products to a degree that was unimaginable in the 1980s.\n\nAll these advances have increased liquidity, diversified portfolios and allocated risk to those more willing to bear it. At a very rapid rate, I might add. The majority of banks’ involvement in derivatives has been through interest rate swaps, which grew 26 percent last year. But the fastest growth has been in credit derivatives, which by some measures increased 55 percent last year and tenfold in the past three years or so.\n\nBy any accounting, growth in structured credit products has been enormous. As a result, many new players have now entered these markets—issuers and distributors as well as buyers. Slightly more than 40 percent of the collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, backed by corporate loans and rated by Moody’s last year were set up by first-time issuers that have not yet managed through a downturn in the credit cycle.\n\nThe memory cells begin to tingle. We are reminded that investors and financial institutions need to consider fully the potential for broad swings in financial markets to cause losses across a range of asset classes, even when losses may seem uncorrelated in a more benign environment. As we learned from our own experience here in Texas, adverse performance may be more correlated across assets than many expect, and the ramifications for pricing errors can be enormous.\n\nI often hear anecdotes of seemingly risk-laden financial deals fetching only bare-bones margins. Capital appears to be chasing one hot product after another, even as returns are compressed. In this regard, we should be mindful of the possibility that intense competition is causing investors to reach for yield and assume too much risk, just as Texas banks did in the 1980s with their aggressive shift from the faltering energy sector to the glitter of real estate.\n\nTo complicate the situation even further, there are reasons to suspect the recent surge in financial innovation, improperly understood, can intensify rather than mitigate the scope for error.\n\nI have just returned from a spring break vacation in the Caribbean with my daughter. While we were there, a local ichthyologist explained that fish have no memories and tend to swim in schools.\n\nWhen we were out of the water, my tutors in the Dallas Fed’s Research Department had me read a brief about the great economist Frank Knight—now best known as Milton Friedman’s teacher. And for pure reading pleasure, I took along a compendium of Charles Dickens’ works.\n\nThere are lessons about risk to be gleaned from all three: the fish expert, Frank Knight and Dickens. Let’s start with Knight.\n\nKnight viewed probabilities in three ways. The first and simplest is something like a roll of a fair die, where the odds of a six can be computed as one-sixth. Second are repeatable events, such as the proportion of widgets that might break on a production line. Here, experience can be a good teacher. If we observe three of 1,000 widgets breaking on Tuesday, a similar proportion might be expected to break on Wednesday. Third, there are unique events where probabilities can only be formed through judgments. For example, what is the probability that a certain new product might eventually rival the iPod or the Blackberry in popularity?\n\nIn Knight's view, it is easiest to position for risk in the first two circumstances. The most difficult and most important business decisions involve the third type of probability, where judgment plays a decisive role.\n\nThere is an ever-present risk that financial markets may be treating recent innovations as if they were in the second category, where probabilities can be based on experience, when in fact many new financial products still belong to the third category—the most difficult one, for which sound judgment is paramount. Many of today’s new financial innovations arguably have not been around long enough for their loss probabilities to be accurately estimated, despite the comfort provided by stochastic models and theoretical formulas.\n\nDanger lies in placing too much faith in historical value-at-risk estimates, especially when they are based on limited experience with new products. Wrong probabilities—whether they result from limited experience, model errors or just bad judgment—can lead to costly mistakes. The real world has a nasty habit of reminding us of this every so often—Texas in the late 1980s, Long-Term Capital Management in the 1990s and the subprime mortgage market today.\n\nFor these reasons, value-at-risk estimates must be supplemented with stress testing and, most important, prudent judgment. It takes extraordinary discipline for financial institutions and investors to exercise sound judgment when the fish are schooling, swimming in pools of liquidity, unencumbered by memory.\n\nThe possibility that recent innovations may have reshaped both the positive and negative parameters of risk is evident in supervisors’ calls for financial institutions to control counterparty risk, such as in the case of credit default swaps. In these transactions, the purchasers of protection can offload the risk of their original positions but depend on a third party as guarantor. Credit risk has simply been replaced by counterparty risk, about which we might not know as much as we should.\n\nHere is where Dickens comes in. In his book Martin Chuzzlewit, one of his characters utters this classic description of financial markets:\n\nAnd then there is my favorite quote from Little Dorrit, sounding the alarm bells when, as Dickens put it, “a person who cannot pay gets another person who cannot pay to guarantee that he can pay.”\n\nMore than 150 years ago, Dickens foreshadowed one of today’s more vexing problems with structured products: knowing just where the risk is or who is ultimately holding it—who ultimately pays should things go wrong. A growing awareness of the potential domino effects of counterparty risk has been emerging, where knowledge of one’s counterparty depends on the counterparty’s counterparty.\n\nIf you’re looking for a financial market segment where these issues have come home to roost, you need look no further than the subprime mortgage industry.\n\nOnly recently have we seen widespread use of a number of innovative mortgage products, such as interest-only loans and option ARMs. And these innovations are now common even in the subprime sector, which itself has grown tremendously. The most innovative mortgage products have tended to be used more in markets with the greatest home-price appreciation, suggesting some homebuyers stretched themselves financially to purchase increasingly expensive homes. In many cases, homebuyers may have had no other choice if they wished to purchase a home.\n\nBy easing the qualifying process, these instruments have made home mortgage credit available to broader segments of society—bringing “money in a hundred shapes and ways,” to quote Dickens’ Tigg. Indeed, many families own homes today thanks to subprimes and mortgage product innovations. That’s the good news: Financial innovation has made it possible for more Americans than ever to have a tangible piece of the American Dream, including those whom some lenders know no more about than they do of the “crossing-sweeper at the corner.” The bad news is that these very innovations have left homebuyers exposed to a decline in the housing market or rising interest rates, or both. We must not forget that these new products have yet to be tested in a credit-cycle downturn.\n\nA student of Dickens or of financial market history might have expected problems to arise in subprime lending. Relaxed standards and documentation requirements are typically part of aggressive lending strategies that accompany asset price booms, and subprime lenders are no exception. Some subprime agents on the West Coast and in Florida and elsewhere in the nation seem to have been as aggressive and as undiversified as the Texas banks and S&Ls were in the 1980s. Just as we had oil prices fueling our lending boom in the 1980s, today’s mortgage explosion has been fed by a combination of low interest rates and some spectacular growth in home prices.\n\nThus far, the damage from the subprime market has been largely contained, as many of my Federal Reserve counterparts have been saying. Why do we say so? To begin with, quality problems have risen primarily for adjustable-rate subprime loans, which are only about 8.5 percent of home mortgage debt outstanding. Also, much of this debt was packaged into private-label mortgage-backed securities with the downside risk spread out over a diverse group of investors. Nevertheless, because 40 percent of homebuyers last year were nonprime (subprime and Alt-A) borrowers, housing markets may feel some short-term pain, making it less clear whether housing construction has bottomed and how long the housing downturn may last. Fortunately, the financial system and the economy are strong enough to weather this storm.\n\nWhile the subprime damage is largely contained, I do not mean that the market will or should refrain from punishing those who neglected time-proven rules of prudence. Nor am I suggesting that the neglect of prudent practices has not bled into other types of credit—such as the Alt-A market. Indeed, it would be atypical for lax lending standards in one area of credit not to lead to laxity in others. Nor am I placing excessive faith in models that have yet to be tested by real developments.\n\nThe subprime situation may well be a blessing in disguise. It reminds us that history does have the capacity to repeat itself. The old financial axioms—levelheaded notions such as “know your customer” (or your counterparty) and “there is a difference between price and value”—remain valid. I expect market discipline to reassert itself, swiftly punishing those who pressed the limits of imprudence or suffered selective amnesia, hopefully doing so in a way that staves off the impulse for lawmakers and regulators to interfere disproportionately.\n\nI acknowledge that is a tall order. But I am encouraged by what I see developing. As a former market operator, I take comfort in knowing that over time markets always clear. To be sure, the economy will grow somewhat more slowly because of the correction in the housing market. At the same time, other pistons in our economic engine, particularly consumption, continue pumping. And a buildup in housing inventory means that responsible buyers will be able to purchase homes at more affordable prices. We may have had a glimpse into this process in the National Association of Realtors report of pending home sales released yesterday.\n\nIn addressing the subprime issue, regulatory agencies are working hard to avoid causing an overreaction with credit standards that would needlessly cause too much of a slowdown in housing or the overall economy. And we do not want to stifle financial innovation simply because some problems have arisen in one sector.\n\nPolicymakers can learn a great deal from what they did wrong in the debacle of the 1980s. Back then, regulators and lawmakers had imposed product restrictions—especially on thrifts—that made diversification difficult. These limits were later relaxed—but only after the thrifts had been weakened. Back then, interstate branching restrictions limited banks’ ability to diversify geographically. Tax laws encouraged commercial real estate investment in 1981, but new policies discouraged it in 1986. A policy of regulatory forbearance and its associated moral hazard problems contributed to the lending excess. So-called “zombie thrifts” were allowed to operate when they should have been closed down, encouraging otherwise-bankrupt institutions to “bet the bank” in highly speculative ventures. If it paid off, fine; if not, the taxpayer would foot the bill. In the end, it cost over $65 billion to clean up the Texas S&L industry alone.\n\nI expect some of you will argue that the Federal Reserve also compounded the problem. It is true that breaking the back of looming hyperinflation in the 1980s required the FOMC to push short-term interest rates as high as 19 percent—way above the rates thrift institutions were earning on their older, fixed-rate mortgages. The resulting losses depleted much of the S&L industry’s capital. Back then, Texas and the other energy belt states felt the pain of the eventual correction, much as the coasts are currently feeling the aftershocks of an excessive speculation in housing that was fueled by a combination of low short-term interest rates and advances in financial technology.\n\nBy always bearing in mind the potential for policymakers to compound rather than solve problems, the Fed and other regulators are doing their level best to tread very carefully in dealing with the subprime situation. Mindful of this, I think the recent subprime mortgage statement put out for comment by the Fed and four other regulators gets the notion of sensible risk taking just about right.\n\nFirst, it asks lenders to ensure that borrowers understand the risks in their mortgages. Second, it specifies that an institution’s analysis of a borrower’s repayment capacity should verify an ability to repay the debt by its maturity date at the fully indexed rate, assuming a fully amortizing repayment schedule.\n\nThese common sense principles should enable homebuyers who reasonably expect higher future incomes to temporarily benefit from lower initial mortgage payments. They also recognize that lenders need to see whether borrowers can be reasonably expected to handle the transition from an initial teaser rate or interest-only option.\n\nYou are mortgage bankers. You know what the situation is and what it calls for. I would simply ask that you stick to the basics in your lending practices and that you inform us regulators as to what reasonable measures might be contemplated to make sure that any problems in the subprime sector remain “contained” and do not lead to systemic contamination.\n\nSubprime mortgages are a segment of the financial marketplace in which risk might have been abused. But this in no way denigrates the invaluable role that taking risk plays in our economy. It all comes down to a question of proportion. It is worth keeping in mind the old toxicology dictum that “the dose makes the poison,” a shortened version of a saying attributed to a 16th century Swiss chemist named Paracelsus. “All things,” Paracelsus wrote, “are poison and nothing is without poison, only the dose permits something not to be poisonous.”\n\nI regard risk and risk taking as a good thing. Mae West once quipped that “too much of a good thing is never enough.” Paracelsus may not be as funny, but I prefer his message. The dose determines whether risk is healthy or ruinous.\n\nFinancial markets price risk 24/7. Whether they get it right, of course, is another matter. For mortgage bankers, knowing your customers and potential exposures is requisite to getting it right. A roll of the dice is something else, as is working under the presumption that returns can be made while someone else incurs all your risk. Remember that passage from Little Dorrit. Astute observers recognize that third-party assurances may provide only illusory protection from risk.\n\nIn talking about risk today, I have been a bit of a worrywart. That goes with the job. After all, we are the guys who have the reputation of taking away the punchbowl before the party gets out of hand. I think this is the proper role for the Fed to play, though it is hardly a strategy for winning popularity contests. That said, we believe in the elixir of risk, properly dosed. To thrive, capitalism needs risk taking. Risk is a many splendored thing that drives investment, innovation and growth. A wise man once said, “A ship in harbor is safe, but that is not what ships are built for.” Risk takers—mortgage bankers like you and countless others—build and launch the ships that sail our economy forward.\n\nThe elimination of risk can never be the goal of any type of policymaker in a capitalist system. Risk becomes a problem only when it is excessive or when it is abused—a proposition that is especially true in today’s environment, where financial markets are increasingly globally integrated and information moves with the click of a mouse.\n\nThe main concern for policymakers is the potential for excessive risk taking to result in systemic problems. So far, that has not happened, and we are working double time, overtime to make sure it does not. Policymakers need to remain vigilant in seeking the right balance between prudent and indiscriminate risk taking. As do you.\n\nAmen to that. Amen to fish. Amen to Charles Dickens, Mae West, Frank Knight and Paracelsus. And to Bernie Bernfeld for inviting me to speak here today. Thank you.",

            "content": "February 27, 2007 Austin, Texas\n\nI am delighted to be here at the Headliners Club and in Austin tonight. It is good to see so many people I have worked with and yet still admire: Frank Gavin and Jim Steinberg are but two. I am delighted and honored that Elspeth Rostow is here. It is even good to see George Shipley.\n\nComing in from the airport, I actually saw that fabled bumper sticker calling on voters to “Keep Austin Weird.” It reminded me of the old saw that Washington is 10 square miles surrounded by reality. Austin might be justly proud to consider itself 266 square miles surrounded by normality. But I know better. As George is well aware, about the only thing I accomplished when I ran for the U.S. Senate in 1994 was that I managed to have a dip cone in every Dairy Queen in Texas. I know almost every nook and cranny of this state. And I know there is nothing normal about Texas.\n\nTake my wife’s family, for example. Her great-great grandfather was William Miles. He hailed from Nip ’n Tuck, Texas, a little town near what is now Longview in East Texas. He served gallantly in the Mexican Wars and then, after a substantial interlude, joined the 14th Regiment of the Texas Unmounted Cavalry—they had no horses but called themselves “cavalry” nonetheless—and went off to fight for the Confederacy. He had his arm shot off in battle, was discharged and sent home. To get back, he swam across the Mississippi—no small feat for a one-armed man. He is memorialized by the nickname “Sidestroke” in the family annals. Old William Miles walked back to Nip ’n Tuck and became a dirt farmer.\n\nHe was a tough old bird. Having come home from the “War of Northern Aggression,” he could not afford a mule, so he hitched a plow to his six daughters—there was a seventh but she got smart, married a Yankee and was promptly disowned. William Miles never spent a dime; he saved every penny he earned and prospered handsomely. He died in 1910. His will instructed an executor to auction off all he had accumulated—his house, his equipment, everything but his remaining daughters—so his net worth could be calculated in hard currency.\n\nAll this is captured on his tombstone in the Gum Springs graveyard near Longview. His stone records the dates of his and Nancy Miles’ births and deaths, and the dates of his service in both the Army of the U.S.A. and the Army of Jefferson Davis. On the back of the stone, for all the world to see, are carved the words “Value of my estate $44, 378.34.” That’s roughly $956,000 in today’s dollars. That’s the good news. He died a rich man. The bad news is that his will required his daughters to buy everything back that was sold in his estate sale.\n\nYou cannot tell me that Austin has a corner on the market for being “weird.”\n\nEvery now and then, I like to pick up T. R. Fehrenbach’s wonderful little tome The Seven Keys to Texas. It contains keen insights about our culture, even if he was a Princetonian and it was written in 1983. One of his essential points captures the bottom line of iconic Texas characters like William Miles. If memory serves—and I am paraphrasing here—Fehrenbach argued that the rest of the country used to be characterized by faceless men running big organizations, whereas Texas was operated by big men running faceless organizations. Update this for gender, and I think the remnants of that culture still remain, embodied in people like Ann Richards, Jim Baker, Bob Bullock, Lyndon Johnson, Elspeth Rostow and countless others, past and present, in the public and private sectors, in arts and academia and elsewhere. Many of them may be a bit too strong for some and a little quirky for outside observers, but they embody a spirit that is uniquely and beautifully Texan.\n\nFehrenbach defined Texas as a state of mind. As his book jacket noted, it may not be an entirely rational state of mind, but it sure as heck works. It is what makes Texas so fantastic. It forms the cultural yeast that makes for a vital and vibrant economic engine.\n\nAnd vibrant it is.\n\nIn 2005, Texas generated more than $1 trillion in output. Measured in dollars, it is more than Brazil produced and a smidge less than Canada did. It is 25 percent more than India produced. Imagine that. The 24 million people of the Lone Star State produced $200 billion more in output than the 1.1 billion people of India.\n\nWe export more than California. We manufacture more than New York. We have more Fortune 500 companies headquartered here than either of them.\n\nLast year, employment grew twice as fast in Texas as it did in the rest of the United States. Construction payrolls grew at five times the U.S. rate. We added 26,000 net new factory jobs in 2006, while the nation’s manufacturers posted an overall loss of 110,300 jobs. The energy sector grew its workforce by over 13 percent, well outpacing the rest of the country’s 7.5 percent rate. Our energy sector still only employs about 2 percent of our workforce. Texas excels at the high-value-added end of the equation: Our output per worker in computers and electronics has overtaken California’s.\n\nWith the nation’s economic growth slowing, you would expect ours to tamp down a bit. Yet our latest Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey, released yesterday, showed that momentum is continuing to build in Texas factories and that businesses headquartered here remain optimistic about the future.\n\nIn December, the state’s unemployment rate was 4.5 percent, the lowest it has been since 1982. Employment is robust in Texas. And it will remain so, assuming the Perez sisters and the good people who work at Las Manitas—in my book the best eatery west of the Maginot Line—continue operating.\n\nAt last count, the state’s population grew by more than 579,000 souls in a year. That’s 65 percent of a Detroit, three-quarters of a San Francisco, almost the entire population of Minneapolis and St. Paul combined, an entire Denver, a Kansas City, a Boston proper, a Washington, D.C., and more than the entire population of functioning OU alumni. In one year. And yet we created enough jobs to bring unemployment down to 4.5 percent.\n\nWe are blessed with being participants in a remarkable economic machine. So, what role do the 1,300 employees at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and its branches in Houston, San Antonio and El Paso play in all this?\n\nFirst, we run a business that keeps the payments system and our district’s banks working to meet the needs of our citizens. We pump money through the veins and capillaries of Texas’ cardiovascular system, so that her economic muscles can flex and grow.\n\nLast year, the Dallas Fed processed 940 million paper checks worth over $1 trillion. We processed more than 700,000 electronic checks per day.\n\nAlso, 6.1 billion banknotes—ones, twos, fives, tens, twenties, fifties and hundreds—passed through our vaults and onward to banks and ATMs last year. That’s $105 billion in cash. The notes are scanned by machines that sort 90,000 of them an hour and pluck out $517 million worth of worn currency each month for shredding.\n\nA dollar bill, by the way, costs 5.4 cents to make at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. It lasts 18 months before we shred it and send it to money heaven. A $20 bill lasts four years. A $100 bill lasts nine years.\n\nWe store all those bills in our five-story-deep vault under the 1,204,000 square feet that is the footprint of our Dallas property and in the newly constructed vault in Houston. And we handle a lot of coins. If you ever need to wash your car or do your laundry, call me. We have some 209 million quarters in our vaults.\n\nIn addition to processing checks and cash, the Dallas Fed supervises and regulates 38 state member banks, 450 bank holding companies, and 29 agencies and representative offices of foreign banking organizations in our district. Our bank “sup and reg” people in Dallas are some of the most experienced in the nation. You know why, if you have even a modicum of memory of the banking debacle of the 1980s.\n\nOne of the best folkloric moments in Fed history came about when my predecessor two iterations ago, a wonderful man named Bob Boykin, told then Fed Chairman Paul Volcker of the massive excavation taking place in Dallas for building the Crescent Court complex. “Mr. Chairman,” Bob said, “in Dallas, we have just dug the deepest hole in American history.” To which Volcker responded: “Literally or figuratively?”\n\nIn addition to feeding the payments system and making sure the banking system is sound, we work hard to promote financial literacy in our district, conducting workshops for high school teachers and educators and supplying straightforward reading and interactive materials with titles like Building Wealth, so that Texans will be better equipped to manage, safeguard and grow their money. We also expend a great deal of effort promoting and encouraging community development throughout our district.\n\nAnd we conduct research on the U.S. economy and on the effects of globalization on the gearing of the economy and its consequences for monetary policy. Our researchers make up one of the nation’s finest in-house teams of economists, a team that includes Finn Kydland, the 2004 Nobel Prize-winning economist who has been an associate of our Bank for some 14 years now.\n\nWe run these business lines at a cost that is less than what we earn in fees and on our allocation of the returns on the $35 billion in assets on our balance sheet. You are looking at one of the few people on the planet—there are 12 such men and women serving as presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks scattered around the nation—who is privileged to run a government business that handed over $1 billion to the U.S. Treasury last year after covering our expenses and paying dividends to our shareholders.\n\nOf course, the sexiest part of what we do—judging by the amount of voyeurism it incites in the press corps, bloggers and other observers—is the policymaking process. As I mentioned, there are 12 Federal Reserve Banks. Eight times a year, we sit at a table with the seven governors of the Federal Reserve System in what is called the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC. That is where the base interest rate—the federal funds rate—is chosen and where monetary policy is set. It is done by consensus, with each participant taking part in a discussion presided over by the chairman, Ben Bernanke, who is as good and fair and smart a man as I have had the pleasure to know.\n\nEach person at the table, starting with the 12 Reserve Bank presidents, is called on to give his or her view of the economy from their various perches. Then another round ensues, and each is asked for a recommended policy course of action: Should we hold rates steady or raise or lower them, and why? We debate language for a written statement that expresses the committee’s view. And then a tally of the preferences of the voting members is taken, and the deed is done. The vote and the statement on the vote are released by 2:15 in the afternoon.\n\nWhat guides us in those discussions? An earnest intention to deliver on our congressional mandate to conduct monetary policy so as to provide sustainable noninflationary employment growth.\n\nOf course, some people cast negative aspersions on the Fed. They think we are a collective of sourpusses who get some perverse pleasure out of being tight with money, like old William Miles was.\n\nOne of our fabled chairmen, William McChesney Martin, addressed this perception when he was nominated on the Alfalfa Party ticket to run for the presidency of the United States.\n\nSome of you may not know about this group. It is a club that meets once a year in Washington to drink and be merry, so called because the alfalfa plant will drink anything, anywhere. They nominate a presidential candidate every time they meet, who, without having to wait for the inevitable outcome, is immediately inducted into the Harold Stassen Society—a tribute to the perfect presidential election record of Mr. Stassen. Candidates are expected to live up to the motto “Veni, Vidi, Defici”: I came, I saw, I lost—kind of like my Senate experience. Some great Texans have headed up the Alfalfa ticket. Among them were John Connally, Bob Strauss, Lloyd Bentsen, and both Bush “41” and “43,” well before they were elected president in the real deal.\n\nThis year, it was a former cowgirl named Sandra Day O’Connor. In 1966, it was Bill Martin, who had been chairman of the Federal Reserve System for 15 years by then, who received the Alfalfa nomination.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, which is on file at the LBJ Library by the way, Martin said that as Federal Reserve chairman he had long taken his cues from the German philosopher Goethe, who, he pointed out, said that “people could endure anything except continual prosperity.” Therefore, Martin announced, if he were to adopt a political platform as a presidential candidate, he planned to “make life endurable again, by stamping out prosperity.”\n\n“I shall conduct the administration of the country,” Martin said, “exactly as I have so successfully conducted the affairs of the Federal Reserve. To that end, I shall assemble the best brains that can be found at home and abroad, ask their advice…and completely confound them by following all their conflicting counsel.… I say to you that America is at the crossroads. And I shall do everything I can to keep it there.”\n\nI assure you that those of us who have the privilege of providing “conflicting counsel” at the FOMC table, including yours truly, have no desire to keep our economy “at the crossroads.” Day in, day out, we strive to keep it moving, faithful to our dual mandate, so that we might engender prosperity both for Texas and for the nation.\n\nWith that, I rest my case. I thank you for the dinner and drinks you are about to serve. And I conclude with a quote from John O’Connor, Justice O’Connor’s husband, who once reminded me, “You need not drink to enjoy yourself, but why take the risk?”",

            "content": "February 16, 2007 Harlingen, Texas\n\nThank you, General Cheney. Our paths first crossed in 1967, when we entered the Naval Academy as skinny little plebes. We had many things drilled into us that year, starting with every instructional quote from a book called “Reef Points” that we had to carry with us at all times. One quote was the John Paul Jones creed: An officer is a “gentleman of liberal education, refined manners, punctilious courtesy and the nicest sense of personal honor.”\n\nGeneral, you left Annapolis and went on to a distinguished career as the prototypical, ideal officer in the Marine Corps, and you have lived up to John Paul Jones’ creed in spades. I am proud of you for being such a good man. And I am proud and honored to have been your classmate.\n\nYou remember, of course, that we also had drilled into us the essential need to always be exact—to never exaggerate or boast or misrepresent anything, anywhere, at anytime. In the Marine Corps and the Navy, people’s lives depend on you, and taking liberties with the facts can place them in danger. Of course, old warriors earn the right to exaggerate just a little, especially when they talk about the past exploits of friends. Which is another way of saying that I will forgive Steve’s taking liberties in that introduction. That sounded a lot better than how a no-nonsense, tell-it-straight Steve Cheney would have said it when we were by-the-letter midshipmen: “Ladies and gentleman, tonight’s guest is Richard Fisher. He works for a bank.”\n\nThe Marine Military Academy is lucky to have you at its helm, Steve. I am grateful to be here as your guest tonight at this General H. M. Smith Foundation Dinner and very honored—and, frankly, surprised—to receive the Iwo Jima Leadership Award.\n\nI have a great staff at the Dallas Fed, where 1,300 patriotic men and women work hard at all the things our central bank does—from crafting monetary policy that helps fuel America’s mammoth, $13 trillion economy without igniting inflation, to keeping the banking system sound and the payments system humming so that billions of dollars in currency and checks get to where they are needed, as needed.\n\nMy colleagues at the Fed were excited to hear I was receiving this honor tonight. I asked a handful of them to suggest some of their favorite quotes about leadership, which I might use to inspire you and the cadets this evening. They came up with some pretty good ones:\n\nFrom Winston Churchill: “Never give in—never, never, never, never, in nothing great or small, large or petty, never give in except to convictions of honour and good sense. Never yield to force; never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy.”\n\nFrom Robert E. Lee: “Never do a wrong thing to make a friend or keep one.”\n\nFrom Gen. George S. Patton: “Never”—these Great Men sure like to use the word “never”—“tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do and they will surprise you with their ingenuity.”\n\nFrom Dwight D. Eisenhower: “Leadership is the art of getting someone else to do something you want done because he wants to do it.”\n\nFrom Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf: “Going to war without France is like going deer hunting without your accordion.” Whoa, how did that one get in here? I’ll have to use my leadership skills to get that speechwriter to want to pursue another profession.\n\nAnd here is one about the greatest corps of leaders anywhere on the planet, a great comment from Ronald Reagan: “Some people spend an entire lifetime wondering if they made a difference. The Marines don’t have that problem.”\n\nMen and women of conviction and purpose—especially those given to punctilious courtesy and the nicest sense of personal honor—lead us into the future unafraid of the obstacles that might deter others, just as their military counterparts, like Gen. Holland “Howlin’ Mad” Smith, fearlessly led their comrades into battle in World War II. (Mind you, no central banker would want a nickname like that; something tells me that neither a “Howlin’ Mad” Bernanke nor a “Howlin’ Mad” Greenspan would have been appointed chairman of the Federal Reserve.)\n\nGreat words of wisdom can inspire us, but they are not what determine who we are. Character comes from our upbringing and our experiences—and it is on this very personal level that I want to address the members of the Corps of Cadets who are with us tonight.\n\nI have been in your shoes. At 14, I was shipped from California to Admiral Farragut Academy in Toms River, N.J., a school like this one, but run according to naval tradition. It was a tough and unforgiving place. General Cheney’s counterpart, our headmaster, was named Raven O. Dodge. He had one arm. We lived in fear of him. But we respected him, even if the guys on the swim team called him “Sidestroke.”\n\nWe rose at 6:15 every morning, mustered out to the parade field for inspection and marched to breakfast in formation. We had morning classes and then formed up and marched to lunch with our drum and bugle corps. After lunch came afternoon classes, then at 3:30 we were off to activities and sports, and then, for the last time for the day, we formed up again and marched to dinner at 6. We went straight to our rooms after dinner to do homework before lights-out at 10. On weekends, we had full-dress parades. We learned how to handle weapons and, being at a naval academy prep school, how to tie knots and navigate by the stars.\n\nMy buddies back home thought I was nuts. They were with their families, dating good-looking girls, driving cars, spending money, having fun, sleeping late and doing things on their own good time. I was in New Jersey for four years marching to meals, studying hard, leading a highly disciplined life and getting by on a $2-a-week allowance. We got $5 a week as seniors, but it didn’t make a whole lot of difference because we only got out on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. My life and my friends’ lives were as different as night and day. Sound familiar?\n\nI wouldn’t go back and change any of it because the lessons I learned in those four years made it possible for me to accomplish all those things that General Cheney bragged on earlier. We learned to internalize—to come by as instinct—all those attributes mentioned so eloquently in those great leaders’ quotations. We learned the values of camaraderie and esprit de corps, and that semper fidelis was more than a slogan. Being faithful to your country, your mission and your potential is reward in itself.\n\nWe also learned a lesson that is quintessentially American. When you wear a uniform and you live in the same dorms and eat the same food in the same place, nobody cares whether you are rich or poor or where you or your parents came from. I was the son of immigrants. My father never got past fourth grade; my mother was a secretary. I was at school with a lot of rich boys who had great legacies and fancy bloodlines, but it didn’t make a bit of difference. You moved up in rank according to your effort and achievement. You got what you earned and you earned what you got.\n\nI can’t tell you how many times people have asked me: Just how did you get to Annapolis and Harvard and all those fancy schools? How did you end up on Wall Street, make money, become an ambassador and get to do all those high-sounding things in Washington? How did you end up working with Kissinger? And how did you get to sitting at the table with Greenspan and Bernanke at the Federal Reserve? What’s your secret?\n\nWell, it does help to have good luck on your side—serendipity comes in mighty handy. I have had more than my share of it. But I believe that the lessons and discipline learned at Farragut Academy, just like those you are learning here, are what made a lot of that good luck possible.\n\nAs to “the secret,” you can forget all those quotes my great staff came up with. I’m going to give it to you straight from the ultimate source: Oprah Winfrey. As accomplished an American as you will ever find, she said it best: “The big secret in life is that there is no big secret. Whatever your goal, you can get there if you’re willing to work.”\n\nThat hits the nail on the head. That, and remembering you never, my friends, never, never, never, go deer hunting with an accordion.\n\nThank you. Semper Fi.",

            "content": "February 9, 2007 Dallas, Texas\n\nI am delighted to finally get to speak to the Park Cities Rotary. Before I went up to Washington to serve as a trade negotiator, I was a member of the Downtown Dallas Rotary. When my travels took me elsewhere, I would drop in on club luncheons to share the Rotarians’ patriotism, camaraderie and fellowship and to delight in their sense of humor. My all-time favorite Rotary memory is from a meeting I attended while Nancy and I were vacationing with our children in Georgia. The local club had a ritual of reading aloud the names of ill or deceased members and asking for a moment of silence. They announced one fellow’s name, Harry Someoneorother, who had been inactive for some time and was reported dead. To everyone’s surprise, old Harry wandered in at the conclusion of the moment of silence. Without skipping a beat, the chairman stood up, recognized him and gave him the award for longest distance traveled.\n\nI imagine Paul Harris would have grinned at that one. His wit was matched by his vision. His exhortation 102 years ago to “place emphasis on giving rather than getting” has inspired generations of Rotarians. The Federal Reserve, by the way, was the beneficiary of that giving spirit: Paul Volcker, who is considered by many to be Zeus in the pantheon of central banking gods, studied at the London School of Economics as a Rotary Foundation Scholar.\n\nI want to talk to you today about the business of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. I know you would rather have me talk about monetary policy and where interest rates might be headed. Let me disappoint you up front by telling you I am not going to do that. We held our most recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting last week, and we decided to hold the federal funds rate at 5.25 percent, where it has been since June 29. My views on the economy have not changed over the past week, even with the subsequent release of fourth quarter GDP data.\n\nIn fact, my views haven’t changed since my last formal speech shortly before Christmas, which coincidentally, was to a group of Rotarians in Longview. So I’ll quote from that speech to summarize how I feel about the economy today: “My guess is that we are most likely going to finish the year at a pace that exceeds the gloomy forecasts making all the headlines lately.” I suggested to the Longview club that “if you net the downdrafts from the housing and auto sectors against the tailwinds from other countries growing faster than the United States, then adjust for the updrafts of a dynamic service sector and thank your lucky stars for a warm start to winter and burgeoning oil and gas inventories that have softened energy prices, I wouldn’t be surprised if the economy proves to have grown at better than 2 percent, net of inflation, in the second half of this year, then picks up pace in 2007.”\n\nWell, the initial release of fourth quarter GDP proved to be a gee-whiz number of 3.5 percent, which pulled up the economy from its tepid 2 percent growth rate in the third quarter. In coming months, the fourth quarter number will be revised to account for more fulsome data on inventories, construction activity and other inputs, and it could well be revised downward. My sense is that in the end, fourth quarter growth was still in the range of 3 percent.\n\nAt this early juncture in 2007, I think it entirely reasonable to expect the economy to maintain an average pace of 3 percent growth for the year. And, if we at the Fed do our job well, we should be able to accommodate that growth rate while bringing inflation down below 2 percent.\n\nIf you’ll permit me to again use a meteorological metaphor: We have some disinflationary tailwinds assisting us. There was a series of monetary policy tightenings by the FOMC that preceded the latest series of pauses that began last August. Also, moderation in energy prices proved beneficial, while continued productivity gains, although less than we had expected, should keep labor costs in check. And spillovers from the unwinding of excessive housing market speculation, including softening in the price of lumber and such commodities as zinc and copper, have all added force to the tailwinds we’ve been seeing. I find it instructive that, other than from corn farmers, I no longer hear business leaders muttering about “pricing power,” which not too long ago was an ever-present part of inflation discussions.\n\nYet, we do have some inflationary headwinds to overcome. For example, economists use a theoretical metric that attempts to measure the costs of housing—something they refer to as “owner’s equivalent rent,” or OER. OER makes up the largest individual component of the core price index for consumer expenditures, with a 14 percent weight in the index. The way the math works, when the price of the nation’s housing stock declines, this rent equivalent increases. At year end, it was rising at a rate of 4.3 percent, adding to inflationary pressures. Also, the substantial demand for skilled and some semiskilled labor is driving up wages in those important labor pools. And rapid growth in foreign economies—from China and India to our southern neighbors and our friends across the Atlantic—increases global resource utilization, tightening the availability and prices of inputs and labor that American businesses use to control their cost-of-goods-sold and enhance their productivity.\n\nWe will monitor the net effect of these headwinds and tailwinds.\n\nI wouldn’t rule out further increases in the federal funds rate if inflationary winds gain the upper hand. Indeed, if increases are needed, I would aggressively advocate for them. But for now, I am as comfortable with the inflationary outlook as a prudent central banker can be. No central banker can ever be smug about containing the risk of inflation, but I am pleased with the current direction of inflationary impulses. To quote from the FOMC statement released after our meeting last week: “Readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months, and inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time.” That said, I will rest a heck of a lot easier when we get the core rate down well below 2 percent and keep it there.\n\nMind you, this is what we are paid to do. But there are other ways to deal with inflationary pressures. Only this week, we saw one alternative approach being taken by the government of Zimbabwe, which, according to Wednesday’s New York Times, declared inflation “illegal,” promising to arrest and punish anyone who raises prices or wages. And the Financial Times reports that in Argentina, the government, apparently dissatisfied with the index used to measure inflation, sought to remedy the situation by replacing the economist who compiles it. Fortunately, we don’t have those options. Instead, we continue to monitor price developments and discharge our duty the old-fashioned way, as always, seeking to promote sustainable, non-inflationary economic growth.\n\nSubstantial dividends accrue from a disciplined Federal Reserve. Let me cite just one example that may not readily come to mind. It wasn’t too long ago that the markets were fretting about underfunded liabilities of pension plans. Recent equity market rallies around the world have mitigated that risk. Pension fund managers now have ample opportunities to secure some of their long-term funding needs in the higher quality tranches of the bond market. The 30-year Treasury bond yields 4.84 percent. If my math is right, this means someone can buy so-called stripped bonds that mature in 2037 at $100 for 25 cents on the dollar, thus matching every dollar of their long-term liabilities for a quarter. Of course, prudent fund managers would only do that if they were confident that the Fed would continue to protect the purchasing power of those strips. If we continue to contain inflation, they will—strengthening the financial security of American workers.\n\nEnough said about the economy. The Federal Reserve System does more than just conduct monetary policy, and I want you to know a little bit more about the Dallas Fed and the role it plays in this city and in the economy.\n\nLet’s start with a little history. President Woodrow Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act in 1913. The act contemplated 12 regional banks across the country, and George Dealey at the Dallas Morning News immediately went to work to get one of them for Dallas. On April 3, 1914, Dealey succeeded—the same day, for those of you who are history buffs, that Pancho Villa’s forces captured the town of Torreon. Other notable events in 1914 included the completion of the Panama Canal, the start of World War I and the invention of the air conditioner. I will leave it up to you to decide which of those events has had the most significant impact on our city!\n\nFew Dallas institutions have survived as long as the Dallas Fed. We have been part of the downtown community since we opened, moving from temporary quarters into a stately building on Akard Street in 1921, and then to our current building on Pearl Street, just opposite the Arts District, in 1992. We have the third longest continuous business presence in downtown Dallas and are proud of it. Of the remaining downtown institutions, only the Morning News and Neiman Marcus predate our arrival.\n\nThe Dallas Fed has been at its best in hard times. During the Great Depression, our employees voluntarily took 5 percent pay cuts so the Bank could share the work and hire unemployed Dallasites. In an earlier recession, panicked customers stampeded a Dallas bank, demanding to withdraw their money. It was the kind of run that could ruin a bank. The head of the Dallas Fed, a man named W. F. Ramsey, showed up in an armored car with guards. They hauled a quarter million dollars into the lobby—where everyone could see it. In a scene right out of It’s a Wonderful Life, Ramsey jumped on a desk and shouted across the crowded lobby that he had $30 million more sitting in the Fed’s vault down the street. Just like that, the bank run ended.\n\nThe Fed has come a long way from its early years. Today, we have $39 billion in assets on our balance sheet. Last year we generated enough income to send $1 billion back to the U.S. Treasury after paying out an annual dividend to our member banks throughout our district. We employ a thousand hard-working people in Dallas and several hundred more in our branches in Houston, San Antonio and El Paso. Each year, the Dallas Fed processes 1 billion paper checks worth about $900 billion, plus somewhere between 240 million and 300 million electronic checks. We handle 5.4 billion circulating banknotes each year worth nearly $92 billion. We continue to supply the liquidity our banking customers need in times of potential and real crises, such as Y2K, the aftermath of 9/11 and the devastating hurricanes in 2005. Our Dallas operation requires an underground vault the size of a five-story building—quite something, when you realize our vault was little more than an office safe in 1914. If you ever need to do your laundry or park at a meter, call me. Our vaults contain more than 150 million quarters.\n\nOur other responsibilities include supervising the banking industry within the Eleventh Federal Reserve District. We conduct on-site audits of our member banks and monitor bank performance and stability. We have public education programs designed to raise financial and economic literacy in our community and host many public events and conferences on significant activities within our economy. And we maintain a first-rate research department that provides me with the authoritative economic analysis I need for my role on the FOMC.\n\nI mean it when I say first-rate. Some of you may not know that Finn Kydland, an associate of our research team for the past 14 years, won the Nobel Prize for economics in 2004. He teams up with a formidable research staff headed by Harvey Rosenblum, another Fed stalwart who, 46 years ago, also received a scholarship from a Rotary Club that made a huge difference in his education.\n\nIn short, I think you can be proud of the Dallas Fed. Like Paul Harris, George Dealey had a vision. That vision has been more than realized.\n\nI think I’ll stop right there. I would be happy to take any questions you might have and, in the best tradition of Federal Reserve officials, do my utmost to avoid answering them.",

            "content": "December 19, 2006 Longview, Texas\n\nI am delighted to be here today with a fine group of Rotarians. Before I went up to Washington to serve as the deputy U.S. trade representative, I was a member of the Downtown Dallas Rotary. I enjoyed the camaraderie and sense of purpose that the Dallas Rotary shares with Rotarians here in Longview and everywhere. The vision Paul Harris had in 1905 is one of lasting influence, and I can’t think of a nicer group of solid, patriotic citizens to have lunch with on the Tuesday before Christmas.\n\nAs I left the house this morning, my wife, Nancy, said: “Now don’t you go spoil those nice people from Longview’s holiday by talking economics. You know, Richard, it is not for nothing that they call it ‘the dismal science,’ and no one wants to hear dismal stuff at this happy time of year.”\n\nWell, this bothered me driving all the way here. Then I remembered a tale one of the wittiest of the Federal Reserve’s economists, David Stockton, told last week. It seems a bachelor who thought himself in tip-top physical form was called in by his doctor. “My friend,” the doctor said, “I have just read your lab tests from your physical, and I have very bad news. You have a horrible disease for which there is no known medical cure. I suggest that you marry an economist and move to Arkansas.”\n\n“Geez, that’s awful,” the man said. “Are you telling me that settling down with an economist in Arkansas will help me live longer?”\n\n“No,” the doctor said, “but it will seem longer.”\n\nSo as to not dispense too much dismal science today, I thought I would limit myself to a brief brief on the economy to leave plenty of time to answer questions.\n\nAs usual, I will speak today only for myself and the Dallas Federal Reserve, not for any other members of the Federal Open Market Committee or for the rest of the System. So what you are going to get today is just one man’s opinion.\n\nHere is the bottom line. The economy is sending mixed signals. The bad news is that the housing industry is undergoing a sharp correction that may not have run its full course and auto production is more anemic than desirable. The not-so-good news is that expansion of manufacturing activity and things made in factories has shown signs of slowing, but—and this is important—from high levels of activity. As one of my friends in manufacturing and industrial production likes to put it, \"We are not stepping on the brakes, just lightening our foot from the accelerator.\"\n\nThe good news is that the dampening effect of the housing and auto sectors and the slowdown in manufacturing activity have been offset by continued growth in the service sector.\n\nNow I am going to lay a little dismal science on you.\n\nAmerica has about 144 million workers, producing over $13 trillion in output. Our workers produce more output than the combined total of the next four largest economies, which are Japan, Germany, China and the United Kingdom. When you sit down with your family over the holidays, you can feel good about what American brawn and brains produce.\n\nAnd you can be proud of being Texans. Our state alone produces more than Korea or Brazil or Mexico. Here is a fact that will startle you: We Texans produce 25 percent more output, measured in dollar terms, than all of India. That’s just the production of 10 million workers in one state alone. We are blessed to live in a mighty big country with a whopping big, growing economy.\n\nHow do we do it? What are the dynamics of that mighty economic machine we know as America? How do we keep growing when we hear about the downturn in housing and the woes of our auto industry, or when the papers tell you that China and others are taking away our manufacturing business?\n\nWell, first you have to understand that the United States is no longer just a manufacturing economy. In fact, it hasn’t been a manufacturing economy for quite some time, just as we have not been an agricultural economy for an even longer period of time. This is not to say that the United States is not an agricultural or a manufacturing powerhouse. We very much are. But these sectors have less and less impact on our well-being as we continue our inexorable climb up the value-added ladder.\n\nAgriculture employs only 1 percent of our workers and accounts for only 1 percent of our gross domestic product. Manufacturing employs 10 percent of our workers and contributes 12 percent of our output. If you add those numbers to the contribution of utilities, mining, and oil and gas and construction activity, you will account for 25 million workers and $2.7 trillion in output. In other words, the goods-producing sectors of our economy employ a sixth of our workers and produce a little less than one quarter of our output.\n\nKeep this in mind as you read in the press or hear on the radio and television that the markets went into spasms after this or that index of manufacturing activity—the Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index or the Empire State Index or the Dallas Fed’s newer manufacturing index—was released, or when dour economists report on declining auto production. Certainly these indicators matter and are taken seriously, particularly by the families whose incomes depend on work in those sectors of the economy.\n\nBut in trying to divine the course of the whole U.S. economy, remember that, for example, about 1.1 million people work in motor vehicle manufacturing in this country, producing eight-tenths of one percent of our GDP. The legal services industry, in contrast, employs 1.2 million people who collectively contribute 1.5 percent of our GDP. I am tempted to make a lawyer joke here—God knows there are plenty of them (both lawyers and jokes)—but it is not a laughing matter to economists. The legal services industry provides as many jobs as the auto manufacturing industry and contributes almost twice as much to our economic output.\n\nIn contemplating the course of the economy, we need to look beyond manufacturing and consider where the other five-sixths of our workers work. Where do we produce over three quarters of our $13 trillion in output?\n\nThe answer is in the service sector. We have almost 120 million people producing over $10 trillion in output working in law firms and hospitals and restaurants and offices and classrooms and laboratories and sales rooms. From the medical complexes in Houston and Dallas to the biotech labs of Boston, from the trading floors of Wall Street to the government offices in Washington, from the retail stores in Miami to the entertainment emporiums of Las Vegas, from the universities in California to the software salons of Seattle. As our society has progressed, we have moved up the value-added ladder toward what Winston Churchill once called the “superfine processes” where the greatest profit is reaped and the quality of life is best; where we work more with our brains than with our backs.\n\nEconomists will point out that this is where America enjoys its comparative advantage. We have created a system that harnesses the greatest brain power in the world and the most nimble and flexible business culture on the planet. Our comparative advantage is at the nano and bio and techno and financial end of the economic spectrum, not at the part of the spectrum where we till fields or bend metal. As we have moved up to these higher rungs on the value-added ladder and positioned ourselves to master the “superfine processes,” others have taken our old place on the lower rungs of the ladder.\n\nFor example, Vietnam produces the second-largest robusta coffee crop in the world. They have a comparative advantage in that aspect of agriculture that we don’t have. China churns out all kinds of manufactured goods that they can produce more cheaply than we can. We employ over 100 million people to take these foreign inputs, as well as what we make here in the good ol' U.S.A., refine them, transport them, package them and sell what we make from them in order to grow our economy. This is the service sector, and it is the service sector that drives our economy.\n\nTo be honest, one of our problems is that we do not have very good data on the service sector. We have tons of data that tell us every squiggle and wiggle of the agriculture and manufacturing sectors, but we do not have sufficient equivalent data on services. The dearth of data makes it hard to do what economists love to do: build models that accurately forecast economic growth. We still have a lot of useful indicators for identifying changes in the business cycle from back when manufacturing ruled the day, but we have yet to identify counterparts for an economy that is service-sector driven.\n\nThis is all just a long-winded way of saying that it is difficult to say with true precision just how the economy will close out this year in terms of growth and pace. My guess is that we are most likely going to finish the year at a pace that exceeds the gloomy forecasts making all the headlines lately. If you net the downdrafts from the housing and auto sectors against the tailwinds from other countries that are growing faster than the United States, then adjust for the updrafts of a dynamic service sector and thank your lucky stars for a warm start to winter and burgeoning oil and gas inventories that have softened energy prices, I wouldn’t be surprised if the economy proves to have grown at better than two percent, net of inflation, in the second half of this year, then picks up pace in 2007. This is not a forecast, mind you. There are risks out there that, should they come to pass, would result in slower growth. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, however, I think this is a reasonable expectation. At least, that’s how I see it from my perch at the Dallas Fed.\n\nOn the inflation front, the good news is inflationary pressures appear to have reached a stasis, despite the labor shortages in certain sectors—particularly in chemicals and petroleum industries and in functions requiring skilled and semiskilled workers. The bad news is that the stasis is at too high a level for party poopers like me who will have no choice but to advocate tightening monetary policy further if inflation does not ratchet downward.\n\nAt the Dallas Fed, we prefer to look at inflation through a prism called the Trimmed Mean PCE. I won’t bore you with the details of how it works, but I’ll tell you this: We had some encouraging news in September when the Trimmed Mean showed inflation had dropped down to 1.6 percent. Unfortunately, it rose back to 2.6 percent in October, close to where it had been nestling before the September drop. This uptick was partially caused by costs in that pesky service sector: medical services.\n\nWhen we analyzed all the items in the personal consumption expenditure basket from medical costs to the costs of restaurant meals, we noticed that the median inflation rate was running at 4 percent and that over 30 percent of the items in the basket had prices that were increasing at a rate of over 5 percent. Now, this was for October. The November numbers come out on Friday, so we will have to wait until then to see the latest movements. While we at the Dallas Fed are hopeful that the measures taken to raise the federal funds rate from 1 percent to 5.25 percent will quell inflation and, very important, expectations about future inflation, we cannot yet say with conviction that we have turned the corner and have this problem fully contained.\n\nGiven all of this, I would have to say that the risk of unacceptably high inflation still outweighs the risk of substandard economic growth.\n\nNonetheless, I think we are ending the year in pretty good shape. I do not agree with pundits who argue about whether we can engineer a “soft landing.” “Landing” implies stopping. I prefer to say that the Fed’s job is to provide the monetary conditions necessary to pilot our economy at a comfortable cruising altitude and speed while preventing the engine from overheating with inflation. As we look to 2007, I consider this objective to be within reach. And that, good Rotarians, would be far from a dismal outcome. You needn’t marry an economist and move to Arkansas. You can stay right here in Longview and thrive.",

            "content": "November 20, 2006 Berlin, Germany\n\nI have known and admired Norbert Walter for a very long time. And I have known and admired Germany even longer. I have come to Germany countless times over the past 30 years, but what Norbert forgot to say in his overly kind introduction is that this is the first journey I have made here as a central banker.\n\nBeing a central banker makes it especially difficult for me to provide what has been requested of me by the American Academy: an updated examination of Germany’s economic health—its physiology and some of its pathologies. To speak as a central banker in any German forum is daunting. No representative of the Federal Reserve can claim anything but admiration for the way the FRG’s Bundesbank managed its affairs in the pre-euro days of the Deutsche mark. The pernicious effect of inflation was well understood by the Bundesbank when it dominated the European economic landscape.\n\nFrom its creation on June 21, 1948, until its retirement on December 31, 1998, the DM retained its value better than any other major currency. Over the 50-year lifespan of the DM, consumer prices in Germany increased about fourfold. Over the same period in the United States, consumer prices increased about sevenfold, in significant part due to the laxity of the 1970s, before a grandson of German immigrants, Paul Volcker, restored discipline over monetary policy. The Bundesbank’s legacy has been solidly imbued in the European Central Bank. Any central banker anywhere in the world is grateful for Germany as the exemplar of monetary probity. I certainly am.\n\nBut I do not appear here before the American Academy in my capacity as CEO of the Federal Reserve’s Eleventh District. I am here solely as a friend of Germany, having been asked to revisit a speech I gave before the Atlantik-Brücke’s annual meeting in June of 2004, well before I joined the Federal Reserve. The title of that speech was “Can Germany Hold Its Own in the New World of a Reconfigured Europe, An Ascendant China, and 21st Century America?”\n\nThe answer I gave to that question almost two and a half years ago, when I was a private citizen, was an unqualified “no.” Not at the time I delivered that speech. The question today is: has anything changed?\n\nFirst, I want to firmly state that I am not in any way, shape or form speaking today as a representative of the Federal Reserve. It is standard practice for all Federal Reserve officials, save the Chairman on only two annual occasions, to state that when we speak in public, we speak only for ourselves, offering only our own personal views. I often imagine a collective “amen” follows this prudent disclaimer, especially in my case on those many occasions when I have spoken about monetary policy and the course of the U.S. economy! I want to especially underscore that disclaimer today. This is very much a personal speech.\n\nI did not assume my post at the Fed until April of 2005. I was first introduced to Germany in the spring of 1976. My introduction to Germany came from Jack McCloy via my mentor, Robert Roosa. McCloy taught me that “Germany is the heart of Europe. It is the backbone of the European economy. No country is more important than Germany to the United States.” And he went on to say that “Our alliance with Germany needs close attention, nurturing and vigilance…because its strength embodies profound advantages, while its weakness could involve far-reaching dangers and risks.”\n\nI took that advice to heart and have pursued an affectionate interest in Germany ever since meeting that truly great man. Jack McCloy’s words ring as true today as they did then.\n\nMcCloy and Roosa and another mentor, Michael Blumenthal, set in motion a series of opportunities that have allowed me to meet and follow, up close, the work of Helmut Schmidt and Helmut Kohl, seminal ministers like Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Otto Graf Lambsdorff, iconic Bundesbankers such as Otmar Emminger and Carl Otto Pöhl, and presidents von Weizsäcker and Carstens and Köhler. Over the years, many patient friends and German public servants, ranging from Walther Kiep to Matthias Wissmann to Wolfgang Ischinger, and too many business and academic and civic leaders to enumerate, all have spent countless hours trying to teach me Germany. As has my daughter Texana, a German studies concentrator at Harvard. I reviewed my long history with Germany in 2004 at the Atlantik-Brücke. I recount it now in summary form not to boast of my good fortune or to drop vintage German names, but to make clear that for almost 30 years I have done my level best to study and understand this country. My interest in Germany’s destiny could not be more sincere.\n\nI delivered that speech when I was vice chair of Kissinger McLarty, well before I joined the Fed. In it, I made some pretty undiplomatic but heartfelt statements about Germany. Specifically, I argued that Germany, in 2004, was “so weakened economically and so riddled with outdated operating methods that it threatens the prosperity of Europe, the Euro-Atlantic alliance and the global balance of economic power.”\n\nThat was pretty stern stuff.\n\nHere are some of the more pungent points I made in that speech two years ago, which drew upon the work of Professor Stephen Silva at the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies at Johns Hopkins University, an institute I had the pleasure of helping launch:\n\nTo wrap up that rather mild list of concerns, I cited the then bestseller entitled Das Methusalem-Komplott to suggest that Germany might well replace Florida as “God’s antechamber,” so worrisome are your demographics.\n\nAnd then I concluded with evangelical fervor a quotation from the Book of Peter in the Bible: “Come, be serious and discipline yourselves.”\n\nAs my daughter Texana would put it: “Mein Gott Papa, kannst du bitte mehr direkt sein?—couldn’t you be just a little more blunt?” But I am pleased to report that the members of the Atlantik-Brücke and their tolerant guests at dinner that night cordially refrained from pelting me with their bread rolls. Their lack of outrage, more than anything else, convinced me that my words had struck a nerve. I had spoken frankly as a friend and admirer of Germany, and I believe now, as I did then, that I was spot on.\n\nThat was then. This is now. Upon rereading that speech to prepare for tonight, I was reminded of Berndt von Staden, the first German ambassador to Washington I had the pleasure to meet. He would later describe how Jimmy Carter dispatched his vice president and another aide to Bonn to convince Helmut Schmidt “to do his part to revive the…sagging world economy…” With wry criticism, von Staden later wrote: “I watched as the two gifted, youthful-looking gentlemen gave economic and fiscal advice to the very chancellor who had led his country through the energy and currency crises like no other had.”\n\nI am not gifted. And I am certainly not youthful looking. I am tremendously sympathetic to the task that lies before the chancellor as she seeks to lead Germany through a historic crisis of another sort. And, having not been dispatched by anybody in Washington or by the Federal Reserve, I do not think it is my place to give advice to the German chancellor or any other German leader, for that matter.\n\nI can, however, offer a cataloging of the prevailing criticisms I have read and heard about in tracking Germany’s efforts to overcome the problems I enumerated in 2004. The chancellor (and, to be fair, her predecessor, although perhaps too late in his tenure) has sought to initiate change, but still there has been no shortage of critiques in the public domain, even though most would agree that the German economy has recently undergone a fundamental improvement.\n\nCritics argue, for example, that in reality, the economy is only reflecting the benefits of a cyclical global upswing. These critics also argue that German industry’s role as Exportweltmeister, even with the headwind of a strong euro, masks deep-seated problems. Some say that Germany’s increased export performance stems largely from restrained wage growth relative to its European competitors rather than from improved productivity. This leads one to wonder how much more successful Germany would be in export markets if significant supply-side reforms were implemented.\n\nThe critics argue that recent corporate tax proposals will only modestly reduce Germany’s tax disadvantage relative to its competitors. They point out that, on the whole, your private sector is undercapitalized and overtaxed.\n\nThe skeptics maintain that too many product markets remain too highly regulated and that regulation and high barriers to entry continue to suffocate growth;\n\nThat the service sector remains underdeveloped.\n\nAnd, they argue that Germany has yet to find a way to harness the virtues of what the economist Joseph Schumpeter called “creative destruction,” a process vital to moving any economy up the value-added ladder toward greater prosperity.\n\nThey warn that Germany’s social welfare system rewards leisure, complacency and underinvestment, not productivity and risk taking.\n\nThey say that recent incremental changes in labor laws are far from sufficient.\n\nThey argue that flotation of the Landesbanken HSH Nordbank and the forced sale of Berliner Sparkasse, while encouraging, do not provide reassurance that—other than at the behest of Brussels—Germany’s political leaders understand that state-owned banks are a hindrance to economic progress.\n\nThey maintain that the scrapping of the 50-year-old Ladenschlussgesetz in Berlin does not guarantee that the 16 Länder will take adequate advantage of the June reforms to your country’s federal system—especially Bavaria!\n\nCritics say the new healthcare proposals fail to sever the link between healthcare costs and wages, barely increase competition among healthcare suppliers and indeed risk making matters worse because, these critics argue, they expand the power of the state when precisely the opposite is needed.\n\nOthers worry about the challenges facing education and argue that charging tuition and board and making admissions procedures more selective are necessary but insufficient beginnings to educational reform. The recent initiatives taken to grant autonomy on courses and professorships in North Rhine-Westphalia and the gifts by Klaus Jacobs and Otto Beisheim, exemplary as they are, are, according to critics, not enough to overcome poor teaching quality and low rankings among global universities.\n\nThey argue that the bureaucratization of elementary and secondary schools does far more damage to German children than the relentless television barrage of SpongeBob Schwammkopf in undermining the German education system, once the standard for the world.\n\nTo illustrate the consequences of failing to advance education, detractors note your continued slippage in rankings put out by the World Intellectual Property Organization. They note that you currently rank sixth in WIPO’s rankings and have been surpassed by China in patent applications. And that, according to the Financial Times of October 30, 2006, “Germany is the worst performer among the larger European countries with a [bare] 2% R&D increase last year.”\n\nCritics point to recent studies by the International Institute for Management Development on labor market rigidity and disincentives to work to illustrate their concerns about Germany’s labor market. They note that Germany ranked dead last among 60 nations in the IIMD’s combined score, below France, Sweden, Brazil and Argentina.\n\nOther critics open up the recent issue of Foreign Policy magazine and note that Germany ranks 18th out of 20 countries in the globalization index compiled by A.T. Kearney and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. That puts Germany behind Norway, Israel, the Czech Republic and Slovenia, and only slightly ahead of Malaysia and Hungary. These researchers cite Germany’s low marks in economic integration, a paucity of foreign direct investment and middling internet connectivity as factors in the country’s low ranking.\n\nAgainst this background of concerns, there is, of course, constant comment about the capability of German government officials to lead. I need not review those arguments for you. For here in Germany, just as in the United States, questioning leadership has become a blood sport.\n\nAs a central banker, I prefer to steer clear of raw political sparring. Even so, the harsh tenor of criticisms tossed about by your elected leaders—between parties and even within parties—is strikingly shrill and worrisome.\n\nIn the end, just as there are doubts about America, there are significant uncertainties about Germany’s ability to adjust to the newly reconfigured world.\n\nSo, has anything changed since that 2004 speech? I would say that much progress has been made since my comments to the Atlantik-Brücke and that, despite the criticisms enumerated above, I am encouraged.\n\nWere I asked what needs to be done next, my reply would echo any concerned friend of Germany: that everyone in this country, from the Facharbeiter to the Kundenberater to the Vorstandsmitglied, must seize the opportunities presented by recent reforms and by the improving business cycle to help Germany prosper anew.\n\nThere is no denying significant efforts have been undertaken to overcome the inertia of the German economy I described so graphically in 2004. But the work of adapting to a changing world is never done. Globalization is an inexorable force. Nicholas Sarkosy of France said it best just two weeks ago. “It would be as pointless to deny [globalization] or oppose it as to challenge the law of gravity or to stop the movement of the clouds.”\n\nGermany has embarked upon what is certain to be a long and difficult journey to secure its future in a tough, competitive, globalized world. Success will require the kind of determination that was the hallmark of the Bundesbank during the postwar period. And just as the Bundesbank charted the best course to navigate a treacherous world, the German private and public sectors must again become exemplars of how to successfully navigate a globalized one.\n\nTo wrap up, I am going to do something that I believe no other American speaker would dare do. I am going to quote Calvin Coolidge! Those who know American history know that President Coolidge didn’t say much, but when he did speak, he said a great deal. “Nothing in this world,” Coolidge said, “can take the place of persistence…Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan ‘press on’ has solved, and always will solve, the problems of the human race.”\n\nPersistence in pursuing economic reform will solve the problems that threaten Germany’s future. Germany must “press on” with needed reforms to its laws and to its attitudes toward competition and the pursuit of excellence.\n\nAnd so I conclude with a modified exhortation from my evangelical 2004 speech: Come, be serious and discipline yourselves. For the sake of Europe, the Atlantic Alliance and the world. For your sake. And ours. Press on. There is still much to do.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "November 17, 2006 Frankfurt am Main, Germany\n\nThank you, Herr Muller. I am grateful to be here. I am especially grateful to see Graf Lambsdorf sitting up there in the balcony. I have known and admired Graf Lambsdorf since 1978. He is an icon in postwar German economic history. Otto, with you looking now over my right shoulder, I will have to be especially measured in what I say. And, before I begin, let me point out that I am not speaking on behalf of the Federal Reserve or the Federal Open Market Committee. Today, as always, I speak only for myself.\n\nThe question posed by Herr Muller was: “Traditionally the U.S. dollar has been the major reserve currency and the first choice when it comes to issue bonds. Is this strong position of the dollar at risk due to the euro?”\n\nThe U.S. dollar has long played the role of the world’s premier international currency. It replaced the British pound in this role and has enjoyed a near monopoly for several decades. The creation of the euro fundamentally changed things. The question is: will the euro eventually match or surpass the dollar as an international currency?\n\nTo start answering that question we need to consider the factors that determine whether a currency is used extensively beyond the borders of the country—or, in the case of the euro, the group of countries that issue it.\n\nProbably the single most important factor determining whether a currency will play an important international role is the extent to which private agents perceive the currency as being a stable abode of purchasing power. That is, are investors and other market participants confident that the currency will retain its value over time so that it can serve as a store of value?\n\nThe ultimate determinant of the long-run value of a currency is the monetary policy pursued by the central bank that issues it—the Federal Reserve System in the case of the dollar and the European Central Bank in the case of the euro. In the postwar period, the Fed has done a good job as guardian of the value of the dollar, though perhaps we could have done a better job during the 1970s.\n\nThe dollar is viewed as a “hard currency,” as was the Deutsche mark during its lifetime, due to the policies of the Bundesbank. From its creation on June 21, 1948, until its retirement on December 31, 1998, the DM retained its value better than any other major currency.\n\nOver the lifetime of the DM, consumer prices in Germany increased fourfold. Over the same period, U.S. consumer prices increased about sevenfold! Most of the difference stems from the different performance of the Fed and the Bundesbank during the Great Inflation of the1970s. Yet both currencies are viewed as strong currencies because the performance of other central banks was so much worse.\n\nWriting more than two and a half centuries ago, one of our nation’s founding fathers, Benjamin Franklin, noted, “He that kills a breeding sow destroys all her offspring to the thousandth generation. He that murders a crown”—a dollar—“destroys all that it might have produced.” The pernicious effect of inflation on economic activity was well understood by the Bundesbank when it dominated the European monetary landscape, and it is well understood by the Fed and the European Central Bank (ECB) today. Indeed, the experience of the 1970s has taught many central banks the importance of remaining focused on long-term price stability.\n\nThe extent to which a country is actively engaged in international trade and finance is of comparable importance in determining whether the country’s currency is used internationally. Specifically, open, deep, broad and dynamic financial markets are key to ensuring that the currency can be used to engage in financial transactions at low cost. Open financial markets usually go hand in hand with active involvement in world trade. Students of history know that both the Dutch guilder and the British pound have played an important role as international currencies at times in the past when these countries were major trading nations with global reach comparable to that of the United States today.\n\nAnd finally, the economic size of a country will also be important. A country that is economically large will have a large natural constituency for its currency and will find it easier to shift currency risk to its trading partners by requiring that trade be denominated in its own currency. It is not just the current economic size of a country that matters—the country’s long-term growth prospects will also play an important role in determining the international use of its currency.\n\nGermany possessed many of the characteristics needed to make the DM an international currency, and the DM was second only to the dollar in international importance before being replaced by the euro in 1999. We have already noted the remarkable job the Bundesbank did at preserving the purchasing power of the DM during its lifetime. By the 1960s, Germany was the third largest economy in the world and, for much of the postwar period, one of the most dynamic. German capital markets were relatively open and liquid, and Germany’s exporters had a global presence.\n\nBut the DM was never likely to displace the dollar in international transactions. Germany was never more than one quarter the economic size of the U.S., measured in terms of GDP in constant purchasing power parity (PPP) dollars, even after reunification. And this factor was probably key to limiting the role of the DM in international transactions. The DM was widely used within Europe and in neighboring countries and played a pivotal role in anchoring the monetary policies of other central banks prior to economic and monetary union (EMU). A significant proportion of the stock of DM banknotes circulated outside of Germany, by some estimates as much as 30 to 40 percent. But this was limited to countries adjacent to the DM area. Despite the global reach of German exporters, the DM never attained the same standing as an international currency as the dollar.\n\nThe creation of EMU in 1999 and the launch of the euro fundamentally changed things.\n\nIn economic size, the euro area and the U.S. are quite similar. In terms of population, the euro area is larger than the U.S., which just recently passed the 300 million mark. The U.S. accounts for about 20 percent of global output, while the euro area accounts for about 15 percent. The euro area is more engaged in world trade than the U.S., according to conventional measures, exporting about twice as much as a share of GDP as does the U.S., while the U.S. is a bigger recipient of international flows of labor and capital.\n\nThe guardian of the euro’s value, the ECB, has been given a strong mandate to pursue price stability. The ECB has defined price stability in the euro area as an annual rate of increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) “below, but close to, 2 percent over the medium term.” And in the short history of the euro, it has done a good job controlling inflation.\n\nSince the launch of the euro in January 1999, the average annual rate of inflation in the euro area has been just a bit above the 2 percent limit—2.1 percent, to be precise. Measured on a comparable basis, i.e., using the experimental HICP published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), inflation in the U.S. over the same period has been somewhat higher, at 2.6 percent.\n\nOf course, the FOMC tends to focus on a different price index in its deliberations, namely the so-called core PCE, which excludes food and energy but includes the cost of owner-occupied housing, an item that is conspicuously absent from the HICP. Measured on this basis, our performance looks a lot more like that of the ECB.\n\nBut rather than dwell on the arcana of price indices, let me just note that by any standard, the ECB has done a good job at safeguarding the value of the currency in its care, and in this sense has made the euro an attractive international currency. During its short life, the euro has retained its value just as well as the DM did over the half century of its existence.\n\nWhile the ECB has delivered a currency that retains its purchasing power at least as well as the dollar, there are at least three reasons why the euro is unlikely to displace the dollar as the dominant international currency in the near term.\n\nFirst, the growth prospects of the euro area.\n\nSecond, the uniqueness of EMU.\n\nThird, the benefits of incumbency.\n\nLet’s consider each of these in turn.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\n\n\nBoth the U.S. and the euro area have experienced the same 1.2 percent average annual growth in employment since 1999, but real GDP has grown more rapidly in the U.S., due in part to more rapid productivity growth. Over the past decade, a significant productivity growth gap has emerged between the U.S. and the euro area. The gap has proved remarkably persistent and has led to calls for more deregulation of labor and product markets within the euro area. Hardly a month goes by without the ECB calling for structural reforms to raise the euro area’s structural growth rate. In 2000, the leaders of the European Union (EU) embraced the Lisbon Agenda with the objective of making the EU “the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-driven economy by 2010.” I think it is fair to say that progress to date has been disappointing, and there continues to be remarkably little appetite for tackling the obvious problems, despite increased pressures from globalization.\n\nRecently, Consensus Economics polled private forecasters for their long-term projections of GDP growth and inflation over the next decade. The forecast was that U.S. real GDP would increase at an average annual rate of about 3.0 percent between now and 2016. The forecast for the euro area was about a percentage point less, reflecting both slower population growth and slower productivity growth. The projected decline in the working-age population of the euro area, and the repercussions this will have for the sustainability of public finances in many member countries, must surely be a source of concern.\n\nUniqueness of EMU\n\nThe second factor that may limit the speed of the euro’s adoption as an international currency has to do with the uniqueness of the monetary union. EMU is without doubt a truly unique undertaking. It is unprecedented for a group of nation states of such size to agree to share monetary sovereignty. There is no historical playbook that can be referred to when problems arise.\n\nThe institutional framework of monetary union—the European System of Central Banks—is modeled after the Bundesbank, which was, in turn, modeled after the Federal Reserve System, so in a sense the ESCB is a grandchild of the Fed! As I mentioned earlier, the Bundesbank did a remarkable job of preserving the purchasing power of the DM, and the structure of the ESCB along with its mandate for price stability and independence will help ensure that the euro is a strong currency.\n\nI have already noted that during its short life to date the euro has retained its purchasing power about as well as the DM did during its existence. Looking forward, the same forecasters who are so pessimistic about the euro area’s growth prospects over the next decade are relatively optimistic about its inflation prospects. They think that inflation in the U.S. will average 2.3 percent or so over the next decade, but only 1.9 percent in the euro area. Of course, some—or perhaps all—of this may simply reflect differences in the way we measure prices. The relevant point is that the forecasting community seems to believe the ECB’s commitment to price stability, and other measures of inflation expectations seem to bear this out.\n\nMany economists who have followed the process of European monetary integration have expressed concern that the euro is “a currency without a government,” and that there is no precedent for a monetary union that was not based on a political union. At one level, the less government involvement in money, the better. History has shown that countries with central banks that are independent of politics tend to deliver lower inflation with little or no cost in terms of output growth.\n\nOf course, this is not the sense in which some worry about the euro. While it is now generally accepted that central bank independence is the surest path to long-run price stability, this independence must be accompanied by central bank accountability. In the United States, the Federal Reserve enjoys considerable operational independence but is held accountable to the democratically elected representatives of the American people through regular reports to Congress. The ECB is likewise accountable to the European Parliament, but the perceived “democratic deficit” in European Union institutions raises questions in the minds of some whether this is enough. The European Parliament is viewed as subordinate to national parliaments. Not even a Texan would argue that U.S. state legislative bodies are superior to the U.S. Congress or the president!\n\nThe recent rejection of the constitutional treaty leaves one wondering what sort of political relationship will exist between the countries of the EU and the euro area in the future. Can a monetary union succeed and prosper without a full blown political union, or will the EU create a new model that will serve as a template for the 21st century, just as Europe gave the world the idea of the nation state with the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648?\n\nBenefits of Incumbency\n\nEven if the euro area was as politically integrated as the United States, and was not confronted with the prospects of low productivity growth and an increased dependency ratio, the euro might still take some time to match or displace the dollar as the world’s primary international currency. The reason has to do with the benefits of incumbency in currency use.\n\nIn a world of fiat currencies, my willingness to accept a currency depends on my belief that others will accept it in turn. The dollar is widely used as an international medium of exchange because people know that if they accept dollars in exchange for goods or services, they will find it relatively easy to spend these dollars on other goods or services or invest them in dollar-denominated assets. A currency that is widely used will be more liquid than one that is not, and this liquidity will serve to enhance the attractiveness of the currency.\n\nDislodging an international currency from its preeminent role is difficult, but it has happened. The dollar displaced sterling as the world’s leading international currency during the interwar period. But economic theory and historical experience suggest that large shocks are required for such transitions to occur. In the case of the dollar and sterling, the large shocks were the two world wars and the Great Depression, along with the shift in the relative size of the economies of the U.S. and the UK.\n\nThe dollar is widely used as a transactions medium, as an invoicing currency and as a currency of issuance for international bonds. The euro has made some inroads in all of these areas—not least as a transactions medium, where the existence of €500 notes has enhanced the currency’s attractiveness relative to the dollar in the cash economy—but at nowhere near the pace that some analysts had predicted prior to the currency’s launch. I would expect the euro to continue to grow in importance as an international currency in coming years.\n\nThe benefits of incumbency in currency use are much like those in language use. English has now become the lingua franca of international business. English is widely used in European institutions, including the ECB, despite the fact that native English speakers are a small share of Europe’s population. It has become the second language of choice for non-native speakers and will likely remain so for some time to come.\n\nOne final observation on incumbency. Offsetting to some extent the benefits that come with incumbency is the desire for portfolio diversification. As the euro becomes established as a credible store of value, it will become increasingly attractive for international investors who want to diversify their portfolios and limit their exposure to dollars. Such diversification seems likely to occur gradually, and the option to diversify is surely a benefit to the world as a whole.\n\nIn conclusion, when commenting on the likely fates of two faith-based, or fiat, currencies, it seems appropriate to quote from the Bible:\n\n“What has been is what will be,\nand what has been done is what will be done;\nthere is nothing new under the sun.”\n—Ecclesiastes 1:9\n\nWell, it turns out that there is something new under the sun: the euro.\n\nMany decades ago, a prominent international economist noted that the ability to create its own domestic money is the key financial distinction of a sovereign state. Some authors have termed this the “One Nation/One Money” myth. The creation of the euro and its spread beyond the borders of the euro area is but the most dramatic example of the so-called deterritorialization of money; the currency counterpart of the ongoing process of globalization that is fundamentally changing the economic landscape.\n\nIn a recent interview with the Financial Times, one of the pivotal figures in the early years of EMU, Otmar Issing, noted that the creation of the euro was “an extremely good thing” but that the new currency is “not yet on absolutely safe foundations.” There is no doubt that the creation of the euro has helped strengthen the single market within the EU, increasing price transparency and boosting trade. Many of the participating countries enjoy a degree of monetary stability that previously eluded them.\n\nBut challenges remain. The euro area countries are still separate political entities. Never before have several sovereign nations of such economic size surrendered their monetary independence to a supra-national institution and agreed to share sovereignty in such an important area. The euro is sailing into the future through uncharted waters, without the usual rudder of political unity.\n\nIn addition, the euro area faces significant structural and demographic impediments to long-term growth. While there is widespread recognition in policymaking circles that there are major problems, there has been remarkably little enthusiasm for fundamental reforms.\n\nAn eclipse of the dollar is very unlikely in the near term. Even so, the Fed must be ever vigilant in preserving the value of the dollar. As Keynes noted, building on Lenin’s famous remark about how best to destroy capitalism: “There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and it does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose.”\n\nThe members of the FOMC understand this and are committed to price stability. Our counterparts at the ECB are equally committed to price stability. Two strong currencies with global reach are an unambiguous good for the world and make us all better off in the long run.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "November 2, 2006 New York\n\nI am grateful for your invitation to speak before the NYABE today. My dear friend of decades and director of research at the Dallas Fed, Harvey Rosenblum, was once the president of NABE and spoke to this fine assemblage of minds back in 2002. That speaks volumes about the quality and importance of this forum. It is an honor to appear before you.\n\nIn keeping with today's popular obsession with disclosing any and all personal faults to as large a public as possible, I have a confession to make: I am data dependent. I have developed a strong and growing addiction to ever more refined and pure economic data. Alas, the stuff I need to feed my habit is not available on the street. So I am here today to suggest to you that there might be a profitable market for clever economists to exploit.\n\nBefore I get into that, please allow me to issue two disclosures. First, the thoughts I am about to share with you are my own and not those of any other Federal Reserve official or of the Federal Open Market Committee. Second, I am not a trained economist and make no pretense whatsoever of being a formal practitioner of the dismal science. To me, \"dismal\" is a misnomer; economics is a vibrant and exciting field of study, especially in a capitalist society where it best applies itself to the conundrums of capital markets and the intricacies of monetary policy.\n\nI came to economics and the markets late in life. I started out as a midshipman at the Naval Academy, then migrated from learning to navigate the seas to navigating through the undergraduate basics of economics at Harvard. After a brief detour to Oxford—principally to find my wife and perfect my taste for good beer—it was onward to Stanford Business School, where I discovered what has become a lifelong passion, with its own branch of economics: decisionmaking under conditions of uncertainty.\n\nFor over a decade before I took up public service in 1997, I was able to profit from that passion as a hedge fund manager. Back in those days, the investors in funds actually made more than the managers of those funds—imagine that! Now I have the responsibility to apply what I have learned over the years in a different context—the making of monetary policy.\n\nSuccessful hedge fund managers and effective central bankers share at least one trait: They abide by what I refer to as \"the Gretzky principle.\" Hockey's Great One, Wayne Gretzky, once proclaimed, \"I skate to where the puck is going to be, not to where it has been.\" It seems to me that success, whether for central bankers, hedge fund managers or business economists, comes with anticipating what comes next and acting decisively to be positioned for where the economic \"puck\" is likely to go.\n\nTo apply the Gretzky principle, good judgment, not a small amount of good luck and good data are needed.\n\nGood judgment certainly characterizes the men and women I have the honor of serving beside on the FOMC. For today's purposes, I want to duly note their good judgment, politely brush aside luck—we will always take as much as the monetary gods are willing to grant us—and focus on an essential element in the art of making fruitful decisions in an uncertain world: good data.\n\nI hardly need to explain the importance of good data to any of you. We all know the consequences of data being wrong or arriving too late. Our reputations rest on the data we use. The better the data, the less our uncertainty. And the less our uncertainty, the better our ability to make sound decisions.\n\nWithout a doubt, both the quantity and quality of the data I review now as a Fed bank president and FOMC participant are far beyond what I had access to in the past. The Fed's data resources are unmatched, as is the interpretation of that data offered by the exceptional minds of its regional and Washington research staffs. Yet one can never be satisfied. As good as the data are, they are never good enough. We have a great deal of accounting and analytical work left to do as we seek to refine our ability to make monetary policy in an increasingly complex world.\n\nLet me give you some examples of data inadequacy.\n\nTo begin with, most economic data are inherently backward looking, often to a disconcerting degree. Obviously, there is no way around this. Obtaining completely accurate forward-looking data would require extensive investment and research into that other dismal science, science fiction. Yet time-travel aside, we must strive to develop reliable real-time data collection technologies and ever more practicable models based on the limited framework of historical observations. That process is ongoing. To paraphrase singer–songwriter Robert Earl Keen, the road goes on forever and the analytical party never ends.\n\nThis is not to suggest that simply developing more enhanced models using available data is all that is needed for us to do our job better. In a rapidly changing world where microeconomic operators, enabled by expanding economic geography and technological innovation, are constantly pushing the envelope of production and profits, one can never be confident in the insights provided by even the most sophisticated econometric models.\n\nEach month, as I prepare for an FOMC meeting, I spend a great deal of time talking with CEOs and CFOs of companies to gather their impressions of the current state of the economy. To prepare for this last FOMC meeting, for example, I spoke to the leaders of companies whose annual revenues aggregated to a little over $1 trillion and whose operating income easily exceeded $110 billion last year. In these monthly interviews, I ask about activity and trends in their businesses and what they see happening with their production lines, customer bases and competitors in hopes of gaining insight into current growth and inflation dynamics in the economy. Recognizing the limits and risks of anecdotal evidence, even coming from the most disciplined and experienced corporate operators, I personally find this an effective way to bridge the gap between what our economic models tell us—based as they are upon historical data and various theoretical assumptions about the future—and what is happening in the real economy.\n\nDuring these conversations, I usually hear a keyboard clicking away in the background as these CEOs and CFOs punch in a few commands in response to my inquiries. And presto, accurate data emerge from their desktops about new orders, inventory levels, capacity utilization, input prices and a slew of other indicators that are minutes—not months—old.\n\nTo be sure, the ubiquitous nature of the data available to today's business operators raises the risk of drowning in information as they search for knowledge. Nevertheless, a significant disconnect persists between the instant and accurate data available to the hands-on operators in the economy and the inadequate and delayed data our macroeconomists are given to contemplate.\n\nI do not envy the statisticians charged with tracking the U.S. economy. We are a behemoth—$13 trillion in GDP, 300 million mouths to feed, 140 million workers, billions of transactions on any given day. But working with incomplete and belated information limits our ability to \"skate ahead of the puck.\" For example, the service sector now represents 70 percent of the U.S. economy, yet we remain incapable of forecasting with service-sector data because such data do not exist. When I was a deputy U.S. trade representative, I could access reliable and nearly immediate data on trade in goods, while the latest services trade data would be up to a year old. Unfortunately, the services trade data represent only a smidgeon of the total impact services have on our economy.\n\nA good central banker knows how costly imperfect data can be for the economy. This is especially true of inflation data. In late 2002 and early 2003, for example, core PCE measurements were indicating inflation rates that were crossing below the 1 percent \"lower boundary.\" At the time, the economy was expanding in fits and starts. Given the incidence of negative shocks during the prior two years, the Fed was worried about the economy's ability to withstand another one. Determined to get growth going in this potentially deflationary environment, the FOMC adopted an easy policy and promised to keep rates low. A couple of years later, however, after the inflation numbers had undergone a few revisions, we learned that inflation had actually been a half point higher than first thought.\n\nIn retrospect, the real fed funds rate turned out to be lower than what was deemed appropriate at the time and was held lower longer that it should have been. In this case, poor data led to a policy action that amplified speculative activity in the housing and other markets. Today, as anybody not from the former planet of Pluto knows, the housing market is undergoing a substantial correction and inflicting real costs to millions of homeowners across the country. It is complicating the task of achieving our monetary objective of creating the conditions for sustainable non-inflationary growth.\n\nWhen we consider the potential consequences of poor or incomplete data leading to suboptimal policy, central bankers must be, by necessity, knights errant of sorts, searching for the Holy Grail of economic data that is both timely and accurate.\n\nIn this regard, I want to brag on my team at the Dallas Fed for a minute. The Dallas Fed has had some success at making our region's data more timely and accurate, a significant feat when you consider that Texas is the second most populous state, has the fastest growing manufacturing base in the country, grew its real output at a 9 percent rate in the first quarter, leads the nation in exports and boasts an economic machine larger than Korea or Brazil or Mexico and 25 percent larger than India in dollar terms.\n\nOne area of our staff's success is with employment data. In March of each year, job growth estimates through the preceding September are revised using unemployment insurance records. But these records are released quarterly, not just annually, so we take advantage of this fact to revise our estimates of Texas jobs on an accelerated schedule. In March 2005, for example, the initial release put job gains for the month at 10,600. When official revisions were released a year later, the public found out that many new jobs had not been counted and that the initially reported figure was less than half the 21,700 jobs that had actually been created. But this was something we at the Dallas Fed already knew. Five months earlier, in August 2005, our analysts had estimated that 17,000 jobs had been added in March. In other words, we anticipated much of the official revision well before it was released seven months later. Moreover, our analysts devised a two-step procedure for seasonally adjusting official Texas employment data that was later adopted by the BLS. These procedures for refining existing data help explain why the Dallas Fed's jobs-growth forecasts consistently outperform those of other analysts for timeliness and accuracy.\n\nWe also have developed a measure of inflation that is, I believe, a better predictive tool for future price movements. The Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate that we calculate in Dallas looks at monthly price movements and sets aside those price categories that rose and fell most sharply, so that extreme swings in the prices of individual components do not distort our sense of the underlying trend. It does not automatically exclude food, energy or any particular set of items. For September, the most recent month available, our Trimmed Mean showed inflation running at an annualized rate of 1.7 percent, below the 2.1 percent annualized rate registered by the ex food and energy measure of core PCE inflation. For the past year—September 2005 to September 2006—the Trimmed Mean showed inflation running at 2.6 percent, slightly ahead of the ex food and energy measure of 2.4 percent.\n\nFrom my perspective, the Dallas Fed's Trimmed Mean measure is especially helpful because it is designed to forecast the underlying trend in overall consumer price inflation six months to a year ahead. From the numbers I just mentioned, I draw two conclusions. First the good news: It is possible that the trend in overall consumer inflation has peaked and is finally heading lower. Next, the not-so-good news: The overall inflation trend remains at a level above my comfort zone. I am encouraged by the change in direction of trend inflation, and I hope that in the future my CEO and CFO contacts will be telling me that the competitive forces of globalization have kept their pricing power limited or nonexistent.\n\nSo the good economists at the Dallas Fed are making progress.\n\nBut these are relatively simple accomplishments when we consider what is needed to maximize our analytical efficiency in a globalized, cyber-enhanced world. Even before we start to develop better measurement techniques to capture the influences of new economic entrants and technologies that continue accelerating at the pace of Moore's Law, we first need to ask some basic questions.\n\nBear with me as I present an analogy that might strike you as a bit over the top but will, I hope, ease us into a discussion of contemplating the vital data we may need to inform Federal Reserve policymaking in a dramatically changed world.\n\nSuppose I were to create from thin air an imaginary new currency to replace the U.S. dollar in my home state of Texas. Since the Canadians already have the loonie—I know how you New Yorkers look at Texans—let's just call this new Texas money the \"burrito.\"\n\nNow imagine Texas changed its relationship to the U.S. in no other way but for the creation of the new burrito and the establishment of an independent central bank with responsibility solely for Texas. The burrito would be backed by the full faith and credit of the government in Austin, and the Central Bank of Texas would have exactly the same mandate as the Federal Reserve, but only for the Texas economy.\n\nIn every other way, business would proceed as usual. No laws would change. We would stay connected as we are now to the world around us. We would have the same flows of goods, people, ideas and capital that we do today as part of the United States.\n\nHow would the Central Bank of Texas accomplish its mission? What economic indicators would we find useful in seeking to formulate a monetary policy designed to preserve the value of the burrito and the sustainability of Texas' economic growth? Would we look only within Texas' borders? Would our inflation rate policies differ significantly from those of the United States sans Texas? Would real Texas interest rates be fully independent of or highly influenced—or perhaps even determined—by U.S. rates? Would we need to take into account the monetary policy of the rest of the U.S. to determine our own proper monetary stimulus or restraint?\n\nOf course, we know that, as with any central bank, the hypothetical Central Bank of Texas would have the power to debase the burrito by printing too much of it or by maladministering the central bank's franchise. But, could we affect our employment and output, given our real and virtual connections to the U.S. and the world around us? If not, should we then just rewrite our central banking mandate to focus solely on prices? And even if we did, would we be able to make the variability in Texas' inflation, and the corresponding inflation risk premium, less than that of the United States? Or would the inflationary impulses of the U.S. condition the dynamics of Texas' inflation?\n\nNow, let's come back to the real world. Is it really possible to assume that like the fictional, independent Central Bank of Texas, the Federal Reserve can make monetary policy without taking into account capacity constraints, levels of resource utilization, global liquidity and other factors impacting price developments in the rest of the world? How do we know what our true potential growth is without properly accounting for the world's resource potential? How can we calculate our NAIRU without an accurate sense of workforce dynamics and price movements outside our geographic boundaries?\n\nYour gut-level answers to these questions may be similar to mine. I would venture that the Open Market Committee of a Texas central bank would pay quite a bit of attention to economic trends in the U.S. and the rest of the world. Reliance on Texas data and econometric models alone would be insufficient, perhaps even foolhardy.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has an impressive assortment of highly sophisticated, regularly measured and accurate data to put into its existing domestic models. But I would argue that we need to supplement them with data that incorporate global trends. We cannot dismiss the worldwide resources that can be brought to bear to increase production and the aggregate supply of goods and services. These inputs dictate the level of competition in the marketplace. In the real world, developments in faraway places like China impact the ability here at home to grow employment and profits and to raise or lower prices. Just look at Ford Motor Co.'s recently announced plans to cut production costs by doubling its purchases of Chinese-made parts. Searching the globe for better, cheaper and faster inputs is a basic instinct of the millions of middle managers who run supply chains for countless U.S. businesses, large and small.\n\nSo what specific things might we want to look at? Luckily, we do not have to look very hard to find clues about the best answer to this question. Looking beyond borders, as you all know, is standard operating procedure for central banks all over the world, including our neighbors to the north.\n\nYou know the old saw about Canada being the vichyssoise of nations: cold, half-French and difficult to stir. Well, the Canadians are hardly stereotypical when it comes to making monetary policy. In addition to looking at essential domestic and international indicators—inflation, output gaps, GDP growth, terms of trade, commodity prices, exchange rates, international interest rates and so on—they begin their analysis and estimates of the future with an outlook for global GDP growth and global growth projections.\n\nCanada resembles the U.S. in openness to the world economy. But its economy is much smaller. Indeed, Canada's output in real dollars is only a little bit greater than Texas'. Economic theory supports the idea that small open economies like Canada's or Texas' have to look beyond their borders to understand inflationary pressures because they lack the heft to influence world prices and the capacity to be largely self-reliant. Small economies, so the theory goes, are price takers.\n\nBig economies like the U.S. are price makers, and in theory, international price developments follow our lead, thus relegating external developments to a lesser status. Yet the euro zone nations constitute an equally large economy. At the European Central Bank, the very first item reviewed in its regular Monthly Bulletin is \"The External Environment of the Euro Area.\" This consists of a review of real economic developments in the U.S., Japan and the non-euro-area OECD, as well as the U.K., other European countries, Latin America and Asia. Next, the ECB reviews developments in commodity markets and discusses the outlook for the external environment. Only after looking beyond their borders do they go into a very standard review of monetary and financial developments in the euro area and exchange rate and balance of payments indicators.\n\nHere we have a big economy and an influential central bank demonstrating the importance of monitoring external developments along with their domestic analysis. Maybe we can learn something from the ECB when it comes to working global economic developments into our deliberations.\n\nThis is not to say that the Federal Reserve doesn't do its level best to look beyond domestic economic indicators. We certainly do. Nor am I suggesting that the Federal Reserve does not ultimately have the power to control inflation in the United States. We have it well within our grasp to debase or enhance the value of our currency. But I would argue that international data deserve closer examination in order to understand the influences an integrated global economy has on our economy and our currency and the implications of that integration for our monetary policymaking. Last week, my counterpart at the New York Fed, Tim Geithner, put it this way: \"Integration does not, and should not, limit our ability to achieve our objectives. Rather, it forces us to think harder about how our economies are evolving and how developments in the rest of the world affect our markets.\" If this is so, we have to focus on how best to improve our collection and analysis of global data.\n\nThe Dallas Fed is undertaking a significant research effort to examine the issues I've addressed today and to answer many other questions globalization poses for the economy and for monetary policy. To guide our research on this front, we have put together an advisory board consisting of Martin Feldstein, John Taylor, Ken Rogoff, Glenn Hubbard and Nobel laureate Finn Kydland.\n\nI will tell you one thing we have already learned from our nascent work in Dallas and that is that we know less about the rest of the world than we think we do. To illustrate my point, consider that there is no reliable measurement of the capital stock of China. This handicaps any calculation of China's resource utilization and invalidates any measurement of China's \"output gap.\" In reality, we've no idea how much capacity exists should a gaggle of Fords seek to cut production costs by turning to Chinese parts suppliers.\n\nGlobalizing econometric models, though, could help us fly a little less blindly. To extend that metaphor, let's go back to my home base of Texas. When I get on an airplane to fly to speak to you here in New York, I put myself in the hands of that plane's pilots. To carry me to LaGuardia, they determine the best course to fly by accounting for headwinds, tailwinds, updrafts and downdrafts in order to aeronautically skate ahead of the puck and get us there on time and in one piece.\n\nGlobalization brings new influences into the Fed's navigation calculations to determine the best flight path for the U.S. economy. To determine that course—and to most efficiently and safely reach our mandated destination of sustained non-inflationary growth—we must develop a better understanding of the new forces exerting themselves on the aircraft we have been charged with flying. That aircraft no longer flies solely in domestic space, affected solely by domestic factors. Rather, it flies all over the world, requiring more sophisticated navigation instruments to monitor changing global and domestic economic conditions, enabling us to pilot the craft safely and efficiently.\n\nHerein lies the opportunity for enterprising economists, such as yourselves, to rise to the challenge I've presented here today and to profit from the development of that new, sophisticated navigation equipment. I hope you do.\n\nI realize many of you would prefer to discuss the more immediate outlook for the economy and for monetary policy. So I will stop here and do my best to not answer your questions.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "October 18, 2006 Dallas, Texas\n\nThank you, Senator [Lugar] and Steve [Stamas] and David [Mortimer]. Thank you, “Aunt” Ruthie [Altshuler] and “Uncle Jimmy” [Hackett]. Thank you, everybody. And thank you, especially, to the American Assembly. I am tremendously honored to receive the Service to Democracy Award and the Dwight D. Eisenhower Medal for public service.\n\nI particularly like the rosette, David. I’ll wear it with pride. It reminds me of those days when bankers used to wear their logos on their suit lapels, much as politicians wear American flag pins today. It was just part of the bankers’ uniform. Walter Wriston, a former recipient of this award for his service to the private sector and a man known to get his way, no questions asked, used to insist that every banker at Citicorp wear their logo pins on their lapels all day, every day, 24/7.\n\nThe story goes that one day, Wriston called his top team together for a meeting. He noticed John Reed wasn’t wearing his logo pin. Wriston said, “Where the (beep) is your pin?” There is a reason Reed succeeded Wriston. Without skipping a beat, John slapped his forehead and said, “Walt, I’m sorry. I forgot to take it off of my pajamas when I got up this morning.”\n\nIf I ever get to an age where I wear pajamas, David, I’ll be sure to wear this little guy [rosette] on them, too.\n\nBefore I say a few quick words, I want to add to Jim Hackett’s thanks to Gloria Brown—and the good folks here at the Collins Center and SMU—by thanking the two remarkable people who made that film. One is Kristen Jackson. Stand up, Kristen. Kristen is a bright, shining star on our Fed staff. She is incredibly dedicated to her work and is a perfectionist. I was told earlier that she spent countless hours of her own time making that film. Thank you, Kristen.\n\nI also want to thank James Hoard for helping her with the film. James, stand up. When we are out in public, James is constantly by my side. He always has a wide smile on his face and a great country boy’s sense of humor.\n\nThe other day, we stopped for a Dip Cone at a Dairy Queen in the little town of Bowie on our way to Wichita Falls, where I was giving a speech. We walked into a room full of farmers and ranchers in their bib overalls, iced tea glasses in hand, discussing hay prices and cows. Needless to say, all conversation at the DQ stopped as men wearing lace-up shoes, white shirts and neckties strode into their midst. The Federal Reserve or anything federal is hardly popular in the hardscrabble reaches of that part of Texas. I was just about to turn on my heels and head back to the car when James leaned over to me and whispered, “Don’t worry, Richard. Dressed as we are, they just think we’re Baptist preachers passing through town.”\n\nSeeing that picture in the South African veld of my mother as a little girl, taken shortly after her father died in the flu epidemic of 1918, really puts this evening into perspective—that image, and the fact that there are no pictures of my father before he was 20 or so because he had no family to take one (and the foster parents that occasionally took him in off the streets in Australia couldn’t have afforded a camera). Juxtapose that against those beautiful pictures with Nancy, of Anders with the first fish he caught, Alison’s sweet laughter, James in his Y-football uniform and Texana in my arms the night I got the good news/bad news that I had been nominated to run for the U.S. Senate.\n\nIf you hold on to those images, then all the other events the film documents—all the meetings with presidents and heads of state and government; the trade negotiations with China and Vietnam and all the rest; the tête-à-têtes with Nelson Mandela and Alan Greenspan and even Dolly Parton (that photo is my favorite: It reminds me of Groucho Marx’s line in the movie At the Circus: “She had a smile men adore so, and a torso even more so”); sitting at the table of the Federal Open Market Committee—all those events, as wonderful as they were and are, pale in significance.\n\nWhatever it is that you think I have done right, whatever it is that the trustees of the American Assembly feel qualifies me for this honor, whatever it is that would lead good people like Ruth Altshuler and Jim Hackett and Steve Stamas and Dick Lugar to allege what they have alleged, would never have occurred if my parents hadn’t had the gumption to lift themselves up from nowhere and come to this promised land we call America so that I could eventually meet Nancy and be given the gift of four beautiful children. My family is the wellspring of my good fortune. They are my inspiration to “pay it back.”\n\nNot that I did not enjoy those hyperbolic words of praise from Ruth and Jim and Steve and the good senator. I am grateful for them. But I do think it is important to put them in context, especially in front of two truly praiseworthy Nobel laureates like Michael Brown and Joe Goldstein; a selfless patriot like Ross Perot; some of the most talented business leaders in the nation, like Ray Hunt (the magnificent chairman of our board at the Dallas Fed) and John Menzer and Jim Hackett and Mike Ullman and Mike Jordan; or truly gifted public servants like Senator Dick Lugar and Admiral Bob Inman; yet alone in front of my wife of 33 years and my children and my brother Mike and my mother-in-law, who know me so well, foibles and all.\n\nThis past Sunday, David Brooks of the New York Times provided his readers a sweet tribute to Adam Smith’s treatise on moral sentiments. Brooks paraphrased a couple of sentences Smith wrote 250 years ago that summarize how I feel about this moment: “We not only want to feel praise, we want to feel praiseworthy. We want to act in ways that deserve praise, if a wise, impartial spectator happened to be watching us. In our best moments, we want to live up to the ideals our society has gradually engraved upon us.” I pray that in my best moments I prove worthy of the ideals you have engraved upon me and upon this beautiful certificate.\n\nA Harvard classmate of mine wrote a poem titled “Guest of Honor” for our 35th reunion last summer. It includes the following lines:\n\nAfter President Turner concludes this ceremony and we head into the banquet room, I know what I will remember and cherish most about this wonderful evening: being in the company of friends and family and having them to sit next to. That fills me with a deep sense of gratitude. That alone encourages me and the good people I have worked with—and for—in government and at the Federal Reserve. To simply know that you and the American Assembly feel that I and my colleagues in public service have lived a life worth living and are doing good things worth continuing to do is the truest honor of all.\n\nThank you so much.",

            "content": "October 10, 2006 London\n\nMy much-admired but spelling-impaired namesake, Stanley Fischer of the Bank of Israel, likes to remind audiences that there are three kinds of economists: those who can count and those who can’t. I am an M.B.A. and a former hedge fund manager, not a professionally trained economist. I rather like to count, particularly when the math is denominated in pounds or dollars, euros or yen, or even Mexican pesos or Canadian loonies. And yet, surrounded as I am today by an audience of the kind of hardball counters and financiers I used to be, I am going to speak about something less tangible, less measurable and of considerably less immediate profit potential. I want to talk about how globalization impacts the economy and particularly the framing of monetary policy in the United States.\n\nGlobalization has become one of today’s hot-button words. We’ve all developed a feel for what it is. Critics, particularly on the other side of the Channel, decry it for sullying national cultures and thwarting the independence of nations. Economists and thoughtful popular writers like Thomas Friedman use it to describe more felicitous aspects of the integration of the world economy. Businesswomen and men know it simply as an opportunity to enhance their resource base, lower the cost of goods sold, drive productivity and achieve new levels of efficiency in their endless pursuit of profit. And financiers consider it a vehicle for expanding opportunities to both mitigate risk and enhance returns.\n\nIn the broadest sense, globalization is like an economic ecosystem in which political and geographic boundaries no longer confine potential. Globalization promotes the movement of goods, services, workers, tasks, ideas and capital to wherever they are most highly valued and can work together most efficiently, flexibly and securely.\n\nWe tend to take globalization for granted at the operating level of the economic ecosystem. However, globalization poses many puzzles for macroeconomic theorists to solve, particularly as it impacts the making of monetary policy.\n\nA year ago this November 3, I had the honor of delivering the Manshel Lecture in American Foreign Policy at Harvard University. I preached about our need to update both the theory and practice of incorporating the inputs of an economically integrated, cyber-enhanced world into the analytical and judgmental tool kit used by the Fed’s monetary policy practitioners. Initially, my message was somewhat offensive to economic traditionalists. It rudely challenged the doxology that traces all econometric blessings to Phillips curves and domestic output gaps, and it questioned the liturgy of NAIRU and other tenets long considered gospel in the temples of American monetary policy. I posited that the standard GDP calculation—C + I + G + Net Exports—fails to fully capture the gearing of the U.S. economy in a globalized world. And I suggested that simply relying on exchange rates to mitigate the de- or dis- or inflationary impulses that result from globalization provides false comfort about a central bank’s independence from foreign influences.\n\nAt first, that sermon failed to move the congregation. But one brave soul was listening, and that was Janet Henry. Janet and her colleagues at HSBC read that lecture, thought about it and wrote a fine piece called “Gap-ology and Globalisation: Measuring the Global Output Gap.” Agnostically but respectfully, it raised some penetrating questions about the new gospel. Janet, you will be happy to know that your thoughtful essay led others to the chapel, if only to peek inside. You may remember that at Harvard, I mentioned that anybody who googled the pairing “globalization and monetary policy” would have gotten only 39 hits. If you did so this morning, you would have gotten 8,850. So we are gathering momentum, however slowly.\n\nToday, I plan to use your questions as a point of departure to ask still more questions. In doing so, I hope to illustrate how far we central bankers have yet to travel to become more effective monetary policymakers in today’s world. Before I get started, however, I must issue my usual disclaimer that I speak only for the view from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, not for the Federal Open Market Committee or for any of the other Bank presidents and governors on the committee. My words are my own.\n\nI expressed little original thinking on that pleasant evening at Harvard last fall. At the suggestion of my respected colleague at the Dallas Fed, the brilliant economist Michael Cox, I simply took my cue from one of the great minds of modern times, Joseph Schumpeter. The work of Schumpeter, a Harvard economics professor in the 1930s and 1940s, provided the essential framework for my initial efforts to understand the impact of globalization on the U.S. economy and its policy implications. In Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy, Schumpeter outlined the idea of creative destruction: In a free enterprise system, our economic structures are constantly revolutionizing themselves from within, as new technologies, processes, ideas and markets rise and destroy the old.\n\nTo illustrate his point, Schumpeter used the example of the railroads in his seminal work, Business Cycles. Basically, his point was that as railroads reached new regions, they upset all the economic dynamics of physical location, costs and production functions that had existed in the area before, and he concluded that, as a result, “hardly any ‘ways of doing things’ which [had] been optimal before remain so afterward.” That bears repeating: Hardly any of the dynamics of location, cost and production functions that had been optimal before remained so afterward. You know this viscerally here in England: Your forebears launched the Industrial Revolution and invented the locomotive, one of the most creatively destructive forces—short of Margaret Thatcher—that the world has ever known. You have lived with capitalism’s constant change longer than any other people. Creative destruction is part of your national DNA, just as it is part of ours in the United States.\n\nWe struggle to understand how globalization's structural changes alter the rules of thumb we look to as central bankers. China and India and the Internet and all the manifestations of globalization are collectively a Shumpeterian locomotive writ large. As instruments of creative destruction, globalization and the “net” influence business decisions, expand our productive capacities, increase competition, reconfigure the assignment of tasks and their execution, and influence the prices of labor, goods, services and capital. All of these forces, of course, ripple through the economy and change the economic landscape, so they should be of keen interest to central bankers. It is one thing, however, to theorize that globalization has significant consequences for the conduct of monetary policy—that is the easy part. It is quite another to know what the consequences are, how they work and how to measure them.\n\nIn U.S. monetary policymaking circles, we work with cost calculations, assumptions about production functions and formulae for policy optimization that were developed before the world economic map was redrawn by the entry of new players and new technologies that changed our “ways of doing things.” Consequently, the majority of the economic indicators we use to develop monetary policy today only look within our own borders. We measure domestic wages and incomes, domestic capacity utilization, domestic prices and domestic industrial activity. Where we do look beyond our border, we focus narrowly on foreign activity’s impact on our economy through trade and current account balances and relative currency values.\n\nWhat about global wages, global capacity utilization and global industrial activity? What about the reconfiguration of assignments and tasks within businesses that take place in cyberspace, enabled by the Internet and intranet? I submit that these nondomestic activities and trends are growing more important to our economic welfare and that they condition how we develop and frame monetary policy. Here is where Stanley Fischer’s three economists enter the picture: Fed economists can certainly count; in my view, better than anybody. But are they counting the right things?\n\nTo illustrate the point, let me briefly transport you to a hypothetical world where a nation that produces 25 percent more than India suddenly materializes within the borders of the United States. From 1836 to 1845, that nation had an embassy at 3 St. James’s Street; the oenophiles in the audience will know that address today as the site of Berry Bros. & Rudd. That nation was the Republic of Texas, which joined the United States in 1845 and, but for a brief digression into the Confederacy, kept its shoulder firmly to the wheel. By 2005, the state had grown to produce nearly $1 trillion in output, exceeding the production of Brazil or India or South Korea or Mexico.\n\nTexas is now the largest exporting source in the United States. The state is currently growing its employment at twice the U.S. rate. It produces $110 billion in manufactured goods and a healthy chunk of the nation’s agricultural output, but, like all advanced economies, it is driven predominately by services, which account for 60 percent of the Texas economy. So it is hardly ridiculous to think of Texas as one thinks of the so-called BRIC countries—except it is larger than all of them except China—for the purpose of an intellectual exercise. (One could, I suppose, replace the C in BRIC with a T and please our hosts by referring to the “BRIT” economies.)\n\nIndulge me for a moment here. Let’s suppose that this substantial economic machine we know as Texas changed its relationship to the U.S. in one and only one way: by establishing its own free-floating currency and independent central bank with the same mission as the Fed—except just for Texas. I know what some of you are thinking: The loonie is already spoken for, so let’s call our imaginary Texas currency the “burrito” and back it with the full faith and credit of the government in Austin, a government, incidentally, that is currently running a budget surplus.\n\nThe Central Bank of Texas would have exactly the same mandate as the Federal Reserve, to wit: “to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.” But only in Texas.\n\nIn every other way, business would proceed as usual, and nothing else would change. We would stay connected as we are now to the world around us. We would have the same flows of goods, people, ideas and investment capital that we do today as part of the United States. We would have the same interstate banking structure—that is, the big national and global banks and financial institutions that currently dominate our banking industry in Texas would continue to operate in the same way. We would have the same corporate headquarters—from Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips to American Airlines, Dell, AT&T and Frito-Lay. Our housing market would retain the same access it has today to mortgage market lenders. We would have the same laws as before. We would communicate through the same mobile and fixed-line systems and maintain all our interconnections with the rest of the world. Only the currency and central bank would change.\n\nNow, ask yourself how the Central Bank of Texas would accomplish its mission. What economic indicators would we find useful in seeking to formulate our monetary policy? Would we look only within Texas? Would we target a specific inflation rate? Which inflation gauge would we use? Would our inflation rate policies differ significantly from those of the United States sans Texas? Would real Texas interest rates be fully independent of or highly influenced, or perhaps determined, by U.S. rates? Would we need to take into account the monetary policy of the rest of the United States to determine our own proper monetary stimulus or restraint? Would our operating procedures via Texas’ overnight bank lending market have to change in order for us to achieve the desired policy results?\n\nWe know that, as with any central bank, the hypothetical Central Bank of Texas would have the power to debase the burrito by printing too much of it or by maladministering our franchise. But could we really, independently, determine the course of our own economy—the Texas economy? Could we affect our employment and output, given our real and virtual connections to the U.S. and the world around us? If not, should we then just rewrite our central banking mandate to focus solely on prices? And if we focused only on that important task, in seeking to restrain or otherwise impact prices, would we be able to make the variability in Texas’ inflation, and the corresponding inflation risk premium, less than that of the United States? Or would the inflationary impulses of the U.S. condition the dynamics of Texas’ inflation? And how about the lags in time between when our Texas Open Market Committee effects a change in policy and the corresponding impact on Texas prices? How would those lags be affected by activity in the rest of the United States?\n\nNow come back to the real world and transfer all those questions I just asked to the U.S. Federal Reserve operating in a hyper-interconnected world. To be sure, the weight of the United States in the global economic ecosystem is greater than the weight of Texas within the U.S. economy. But I wonder if that changes anything from the standpoint of this intellectual exercise.\n\nIs it really possible to assume that like the fictional, independent Central Bank of Texas, the Federal Reserve can make monetary policy without taking into account capacity constraints, levels of resource utilization, global liquidity and other factors impacting price developments in the rest of the world? How do we know what our true potential growth is without properly accounting for the world’s resource potential? How can we calculate our NAIRU—our non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment—without an accurate sense of workforce dynamics and price movements outside our geographic boundaries? Can we assume that the Taylor rule, our most trusted compass, is sufficient as is? Or does it require adjustment before it can point us to true north? Do the old paradigms that guided us in determining lags in monetary policy still hold?\n\nThanks to Janet Henry and others who have picked up the baton, I am happy to see some of our finest economic minds now devoting more attention to these important questions. This past summer, globalization was the front and center theme of the annual central bankers retreat at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, sponsored by the Kansas City Fed. In presentation after presentation, the world’s leading monetary policy scholars and practitioners—people like John Taylor, Ken Rogoff and the Bank of England’s Charlie Bean—talked about the implications of the global economy and the importance of looking beyond our national borders when setting policy.\n\nNow, let me return to Stan Fischer’s three economists. To be able to count, they need the right data to count with. Our reliance on domestic mathematics alone may be insufficient, but at least the Federal Reserve has access to a plethora of highly sophisticated, regularly measured and accurate data to put into its existing models. But as Janet knows, measuring the things we need in order to understand what is happening with the rest of the world can get rather dicey.\n\nWhat’s the first thing we might want to count? At a minimum, we would like to know how big, in economic terms, the rest of the world is. All countries produce estimates of aggregate activity, some in a more timely and user-friendly fashion than others. The standard national accounts give us a sense of how quickly economies grow, but they are less helpful in comparing the relative size of economies due to differences in national currencies, which are our measuring rods. To get around this, economists often look to estimates of purchasing power to figure out how big China is, for example, relative to the U.S. While this may be the correct way to make such comparison in theory, it is not clear that current practice lives up to this ideal.\n\nOne of my pet peeves is the confidence that analysts and journalists alike place in purchasing power parity (PPP) data to adjust real output to account for the presumed pecking order of national economies, based on their size and power. Recently, for example, China has been declared the world’s second-largest economy based upon PPP-adjusted output. And yet China’s output in 2005, when measured in unadjusted dollars, was $360 billion smaller than the production of the Twelfth Federal Reserve District, which covers California and eight other states. My colleague Bill Poole at the St. Louis Fed reminded us last summer that China’s real GDP per capita today is roughly the same as what the U.S. achieved in 1886. So arguing that China’s economy will surpass ours in size in the foreseeable future, as PPP aficionados like to argue, strikes me as a dodgy proposition. Yet, that said, there are compelling theoretical arguments for measuring economies in PPP terms, and doing so can give us added insights into relative developments among economies. But, again, we go back to Stan Fischer’s economists: You can’t add what doesn’t add up.\n\nThe raw material for PPP calculations is gathered under the guidance of the International Comparison Program, or ICP, which is coordinated by the World Bank and the OECD. Upon close examination, the ICP’s price comparisons appear to be fraught with errors. The problems seem to stem from the minuscule amount of resources devoted to gathering raw data. The rich countries of the EU, for example, devote something like one staff member per annum to gathering data for the ICP, a grossly deficient manpower commitment when you consider how many staff years go into the construction of national consumer price indexes and other metrics. One can only imagine how shoddy the situation is in less developed countries. Until statistical agencies like the ICP develop accurate measurements of purchasing-power-adjusted output, this oft-quoted measurement device will be of limited utility for policymakers and might even lead to false conclusions.\n\nMeasuring the size of the global labor pool might appear to be less tricky, but don’t be fooled by raw population numbers alone. Let’s go back to China. China has a population of about 1.3 billion and advertises a labor force of just under 800 million. However, many of these workers are employed in the traditional subsistence sector. How many of them can realistically transition from this sector to the modern sectors of the global economy, and how quickly could it happen? How interchangeable can we expect these workers to be with labor in the developed world? Will the availability of large stocks of underemployed rural labor keep wage pressures contained in developing nations like China, or will their limited ability to contribute to the modern economy cause bottlenecks along their road to economic development and integration? We already hear of growing labor shortages along China’s bustling coastal belt, raising questions about how easily underemployed rural workers can meet the needs of the New China that is feeding the global trading system.\n\nCan we make sense of the idea of a global output gap? It is standard practice in the central banking community to frame policy decisions in terms of price pressures stemming from resource utilization. As I have already argued, I believe it is insufficient to think in terms of domestic resource utilization alone in our globalized world: We need to be looking at capacity and slack at the global level. But how do we measure these things? We already have estimates of output gaps in the countries that belong to the OECD, but these countries account for a declining share of global output, and the estimates are subject to large revisions. The data needed to measure output gaps for emerging economies and developing countries in many, if not all, cases simply don’t exist. For example, despite the boom in fixed-asset investment under way in China, there are no official estimates of its capital stock, which is a basic component in measuring an output gap. Data that might serve as a substitute, such as capacity utilization or unemployment figures, are spotty at best, released erratically and difficult to interpret.\n\nAnd what about trade, my old stomping ground as deputy U.S. trade representative? I wonder whether our traditional measures of trade and current account balances adequately capture the full extent of our interaction with the rest of the world or the impact the rest of the world has on U.S. economic activity and inflation.\n\nFor example, economists tend to draw a distinction between traded and nontraded goods. By tradition, economists have assumed all commodities and physical goods can be shipped abroad, while services cannot. While the distinction between the two types of goods remains important, classifying services as inherently nontradable no longer makes complete sense. The technological revolution that has done so much to facilitate globalization has also opened the gates to a wider range of services to be traded internationally.\n\nThe essence of what it means to be tradable needs to be rethought with respect to services. The key distinction is between services that must be delivered face to face and those that can be delivered remotely. The actual skills required to perform a task are increasingly irrelevant in determining whether a service can be traded.\n\nTrade in goods and services is certainly an important dimension of openness, but it is not the only one. What about the labor market and worker mobility? The U.S is a nation of immigrants. The foreign-born make up about an eighth of our population. Like the U.K., our ability to attract the best and brightest and hardest working from around the globe is testimony to the strength and vitality of our economy. The skills and talents immigrants bring with them continually add to our stock of human capital, replenishing our workforce and reinvigorating our demographics.\n\nAs with labor, the U.S. continues to be a magnet for capital from abroad, a testimony to the strength of our economy, institutions and—if my friends in Brussels and the former occupant of the Palais de l’Elysée will forgive me—unique constitutional unity. As you know, looking only at net capital inflows ignores the true extent of our involvement in international capital markets; we need to look at the more substantial gross flows. Beyond the numbers, however, foreign direct investments knit our economies together. Direct investment by U.S. companies abroad and by foreign companies in the U.S. is probably one of the most important channels for the transmission of technical and managerial know-how across borders.\n\nI think I’ve posed enough examples and questions today, showing the deep void we need to fill. The bottom line is that we have a great deal of accounting and analytical work left to do as we seek to refine our ability to make monetary policy in a globalized world. Monetary policymaking at the Fed—as at the Bank of England or any other central bank—is an evolving craft, half art and half science, requiring as much prudent judgment as skilled analysis. The 18 men and women I have the honor of sitting with around the FOMC table are remarkably thoughtful and wise in their knowledge of the real world. My point is simply that the committee’s wisdom would be enhanced, and the economy would benefit, from having analytical tools to help us build more practicable models than what we currently have to guide our thinking as we make monetary policy in a complicated, reconfigured, globalized world. Today I appeal to you and your firms to help us develop these analytical tools either directly or by demanding them in the marketplace, where you wield considerable influence.\n\nSo much for the formal part of my presentation. Let me close there. But before doing so, I want the conveners of this conference to know that I did note the article in last Thursday’s Wall Street Journal. Stuart [Gulliver], it brought to mind the only quote my late Norwegian mother would dare utter from a Swedish king. Oscar II, who ruled until 1907, said something we always considered admirable in my family: “I would rather have people laugh at my economies than weep for my extravagance.”\n\nNow, I would be happy to avoid answering your questions about the U.S. economy and interest rates. And then I must beetle off to the Garrick Club for dinner.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "September 25, 2006 Monterrey, N.L., México\n\nI am with you today in Monterrey as the first part of a two-way exchange. Tomorrow, I will have the privilege of hosting my friend Guillermo Ortiz, the governor of the Banco de México, in Dallas. Today, he and Deputy Governor Elizondo have kindly arranged for me to be here. These two events, occurring together, are perhaps symbolic of the widespread ties that make Mexico and Texas inseparable and—I suppose for those who do not understand the profound nature of our bond—occasionally insufferable. We share a common history and a deep ongoing relationship that is unique among the United States.\n\nThe bond is personal for me. I grew up in Mexico—in the Distrito Federal. I spent my childhood there, and I recall it fondly. The first movie I can remember seeing was Marcelino Pan y Vino. (After seeing that magnificent film, I was never again afraid of the scorpions that inhabited our house in Mexico City.) I played Little League baseball for the Aztecas, playing second fiddle to my brother, whose team took on Monterrey for the right to represent Mexico in the Little League World Series. Angel Macias and his great Monterrey team, the appropriately named Industrials, won that game and went on to win the Series that year.\n\nWhen we were not on the playing field, we were under the stern professorial eyes of the Sierra Madre School, where I learned Mexican history before I learned U.S. history. My mother used to say that until I was 18, I knew more about Hidalgo and Benito Juárez than I did about Washington and Abraham Lincoln.\n\nMy sense of humor—which my children will tell you is rather slapstick—was shaped by Mario Moreno Reyes, better known as Cantinflas. Of course, that is the sense of humor I had before becoming a stoic and deadpan central banker.\n\nThis is all by way of saying that I have a profound respect and affection for Mexico and her people. Soy parte mexicano y con orgullo. It is an honor to be here to speak to you today.\n\nThis morning, I plan to talk about the economies of the United States, Mexico and Texas. Before I do, however, I need to remind you that I speak only for myself, not for the Federal Open Market Committee, nor for any of the other committee members. So the thoughts I express this morning are purely my own.\n\nJust last week, we had another FOMC meeting and collectively decided the best course of action was to leave the federal funds rate unchanged.\n\nAfter participating in those discussions, it is always instructive to sit back and read the various interpretations that pour forth from well-meaning analysts about what action the committee took or did not take and what was said or left unsaid in the press release that follows the meeting. I liken this process to the ancient ritual of divining the future by slicing open animals to study their entrails. The analytical community dissects our statements and presumed intentions with the greatest of care. It is definitely less gory than the rituals of ancient civilizations. But it is only slightly more accurate as a predictor of the future.\n\nIf it would be helpful as you “study the entrails” of the FOMC, let me give you a quick précis of how I see the U.S. economy and its impact on the deliberations over monetary policy.\n\nIn roughly six weeks, the U.S. economy will celebrate the fifth anniversary of its current economic expansion. Where do we stand on the eve of this milestone? We have a serious correction taking place in the housing sector. Sales, starts and permits are all down, in a range of 10 to 25 percent over the past year. In a few local housing markets—especially in the coastal areas—home prices have peaked and are beginning to decline. This may well be the most over-anticipated and over-analyzed downturn in history. One prominent CEO recently told me that “the only situation that has received more intense analysis than the housing market was the birth of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie’s baby.” But it is a serious matter nonetheless, with not insignificant consequences for the economy.\n\nHome prices in many markets ran ahead of themselves, outstripping rents, incomes and demographic trends. Cheap financing combined with mortgage finance “innovations”—another name for speculative leverage facilitated by excess liquidity—added to the fervor. Indeed, one can make a cogent argument that the housing market excesses were due as much to financial construction as to good old-fashioned physical construction, and that the spigot of liquidity that bloated the stock and prices of housing was open longer than it should have been in a world of less ingenious financial engineering. Regardless, the market for residential real estate had to adjust, and it is now doing so.\n\nJoseph is patron saint for home buying and selling. If you were to have read yesterday’s Orlando Sentinel newspaper, you would have discovered that there has been a run on statues of St. Joseph in various states as fear of the downturn in housing markets has spread. Sellers of homes are burying his statue in their yards in hopes of luring a willing buyer! Apparently, the practice of asking intercession from the saints is alive and well in the United States.\n\nWhat is happening in the U.S. housing market is hardly unique. It is the nature of almost all markets to overshoot and then be subject to correction. It can be a painful correction for those who lose track of the difference between price and value and underlying fundamentals. As long as that correction is orderly and does not threaten the economy’s financial stability, we are best advised to let it run its course, monitoring it carefully to ensure that it does not infect the rest of the economy.\n\nWe are fortunate that the rest of the economy is healthy and robust. The banking system is in good shape. There is still plenty of liquidity in the financial sector. Corporate balance sheets are strong. Investment in plant and equipment is proceeding apace. Production is being reinforced by the settling down of commodity price pressures. Consumers are getting a shot in the arm from lower gasoline and natural gas prices. And, very important, the rest of the world is growing faster than the United States, further mitigating the downside risks of a slowing U.S. economy.\n\nBefore each FOMC meeting, I talk to 30 or so CEOs and CFOs at major companies in all sectors of the U.S. economy. The perspectives of these business operators often balance the good work of our economics staff. Mind you, each of these business leaders is fully aware of the risks posed by the housing market correction. They have discounted the most likely, as well as the most grim, of housing scenarios into their planning horizons. They have adjusted their plans as GDP growth slowed from almost 6 percent in the first quarter to just under 3 percent in the second quarter and to a level probably a touch below that for the quarter that ends this coming Saturday. These business leaders are wary but nonetheless upbeat. They are confident U.S. growth will continue at a healthy pace through the fourth quarter and beyond. One of the most experienced CEOs I regularly visit summarizes it this way: “We were all expecting things to be worse, but they haven’t gotten worse. We were all expecting things to get tougher, but they haven’t gotten tougher.”\n\nExcept in one area: procurement of labor. I am hearing more and more reports about the difficulty of finding labor to work our oil fields or run our chemical plants. Bankers complain of a paucity of bank clerks and tellers. Truckers are experiencing a shortage of drivers. In Houston, we are hearing complaints about the difficulty of finding cashiers for retail establishments. A major hotelier told me last week that there is a shortage of housekeeping staff. And for those who source abroad, finding ever cheaper inputs has become noticeably more difficult as growth in sourcing countries eats up available capacity. Having achieved a considerable amount of operating leverage from outsourcing and aggressively pushing the envelope of cyberspace, companies are now voicing the kinds of complaints about labor shortages most often heard in a full employment economy.\n\nSeveral surveys of business executives have been released in the past week, all of which underscore the slower growth beginning to prevail. This includes recent surveys of the manufacturing sectors of the megastate of Texas by the Dallas Fed; the survey of the smaller but nonetheless meaningful production of eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware by the Philadelphia Fed; the National Federation of Independent Business; the Business Roundtable; and Duke University’s Global CFO Survey.\n\nLumping it all together, I am reminded of Mark Twain’s oft-quoted quip: “Wagner’s music is better than it sounds.” The outlook for economic growth may well be better than it sounds. At the same time, the inflation dynamic may be worse than it sounds.\n\nAs I sit at the FOMC table, I continue to fret more about inflation than I do about growth. While I am well aware of the risks to economic growth, the history of inverted yield curves, and the ever present possibility of exogenous shocks in a politically hazardous world, the “balance of risk,” in my book, is still tilted to the inflation side of the equation. Let me give you some math to illustrate why.\n\nThe most recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) release rounded the core figure—which excludes the often volatile food and energy prices—to 0.2 percent in August, the same as July, indicating to the naked eye that inflation fundamentals were unchanged. But you have to look below the surface. Rounding can hide some underlying dynamics. July’s rate was actually 0.19 percent. August’s was 0.24 percent. To a normal person, this brings to mind the old saw that economists simply put two numbers to the right of a decimal point to show they have a sense of humor. But to a humorless central banker, the magic of compound interest gives meaning to the exercise and presents a different picture, one less benign than back-to-back 0.2 percent readings. On a 12-month basis, the core CPI was 2.4 percent for July. The rate for August was 2.9 percent. August’s core CPI, in other words, was midway between July’s low reading and the more elevated figures of the previous four months.\n\nHold that thought: The latest reading of core consumer inflation was close to 3 percent, not 2 percent, measured at face value.\n\nAs you may know, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland does not take the reported CPI at face value. They slice and dice the CPI to get a median measurement that some of us feel provides a more accurate picture of price pressures. The Cleveland Fed’s median figure for the August CPI came in at 3.4 percent annualized. They also have a measure that lops off the most volatile and presumably least sustainable components of the CPI. For August, that number came in at 2.9 percent, which closely tracks the Dallas Fed’s latest trimmed-mean estimate or 3.1 percent for Personal Consumer Expenditures inflation.\n\nTo some, 3.1 percent does not seem all that dreadful. Let me assure you that were that level of inflation sustained, it would seriously debauch the dollar. At that rate of inflation, a dollar quickly gets whittled down to cents. In 10 years, it is whittled down to 73 cents; in 15 years, it falls to 62 cents. I don’t know a soul on the FOMC who would accept that kind of erosion in the purchasing power of our currency.\n\nBut, ah, you ask, didn’t the Producer Price Index (PPI) that came out on Thursday exhibit considerable price restraint? Indeed it did. Excluding food and energy, it actually showed overall price deflation. But we must be careful not to grasp at straws here. The PPI is very “noisy” to economists’ ears. Historically, it has not been very useful in forecasting consumer price inflation. Indeed, when our colleagues at the Cleveland Fed were studying the PPI a few years ago and trying to devise a way to trim out the most volatile of its components so as to get a measurement of what it showed as sustainable trends, they found they would have to trim out 90 percent of the items. It is hard to hang your hat on the PPI as an indicator of underlying inflationary trends.\n\nSo the central banker’s brow, not having access to the intellectual equivalent of Botox, begins to furrow. If you are an inflation fighter, a vague recollection of Shakespeare’s Taming of the Shrew springs to mind in Hortensio’s cry, “There’s small choice in rotten apples.” The most reliable indicators of inflationary pressure are not yet comforting. Inflation remains elevated and leaves us small choice but to remain vigilant.\n\nThe FOMC left its monetary target—the fed funds rate—unchanged last week at 5.25 percent. I accept that decision. While the inflation risk I have just elucidated is very much on my mind, it is my considered judgment that the recent tempering of U.S. economic growth to a more sustainable rate, combined with the lagged effects of our 17 prior quarter-point rate increases, should act to lower the inflation rate over time. However, if this proves not to be the case, appropriate action will have to be taken.\n\nDeputy Governor Elizondo will certainly agree with me that central bankers abhor inflation. It is a destructive force that erodes confidence, gnaws away at the value of money and undermines growth. In Mexico, once-chronic inflation has all but disappeared. Your country now boasts its lowest inflation in 30 years.\n\nNeither the U.S. economy nor the Mexican can prosper unless inflation is kept under wraps. And, neither country can achieve maximum potential economic growth without the aid of the other.\n\nOur two economies are like two ships lashed together as they navigate the turbulent seas of the global economy. As any sailor knows, when two ships are tied together, they move together. Often, it may seem as though Mexico is being towed along by the United States. I disagree. Increasingly, Mexico has become a critical part of our industrial base as a supplier of our inputs. In many ways, we are not just increasingly interdependent, we are also becoming integrated.\n\nNearly 90 percent of Mexico’s exports are destined for the United States. And two-thirds of all foreign direct investment into Mexico comes from U.S. investors. Looked at from my side of the frontera, Mexico is the second largest importer of U.S. goods, well ahead of Germany, Japan and China. Mexican workers provide a significant part of the economic muscle that makes our economy so mighty. And Mexican inputs are a vital part of the supply lines of American businesses.\n\nThe numbers tell the story of our interdependency. Since 1980, the ratio of Mexico’s exports to GDP has tripled, predominately fueled by sales of manufactured products to the U.S. Many of these are intermediate and capital goods, which account for almost three-fourths of Mexico’s exports to the U.S. A red-hot U.S. expansion between 1994 and 2000 enabled Mexico to grow faster than any other Latin American economy. The good times came to an end in the fall of 2000, when U.S. manufacturing slowed and then stalled, hitting no country harder than Mexico. This was reversed as the U.S. economy gained steam in the ensuing recovery.\n\nTrends in 2006 reinforce the importance of U.S. manufacturing to Mexico. Industrial production here is stout. This strength, combined with healthy growth in domestic demand, helps explain the 4.5 percent economic growth private forecasters predict this year for Mexico.\n\nIt is important to recognize that the correlation between our two nations’ economies has not always been the rule. For a quarter century prior to the 1982 crisis, Mexico experienced nothing short of an economic miracle, keeping pace with Taiwan and Korea. Meanwhile, the U.S. economy in the 1970s was suffering through stagflation. You were up, we were down. When we finally emerged from our malaise in the 1980s, Mexico experienced a lost decade of economic stagnation and financial crises. You were down, we were up. The synchronization of our two nations’ business cycles really only began in the 1990s. Before then, the two countries appeared to be on mostly perpendicular paths.\n\nWhat changed?\n\nMost obviously, our trade ties have strengthened. But is this a satisfactory explanation? Economists are debating whether increased trade integration alone leads to more business cycle synchronization. The debate centers on the nature of what is being traded. When trade ties lead nations to specialize in different products, their business cycles may in fact diverge. However, when trade consists predominately of goods and services within the same production stream, as is the case between Mexico and the U.S., business cycles are more likely to line up. It is no coincidence that the Mexican states that trade the most with the U.S. are the most sensitive to U.S. industrial activity.\n\nThe foreign trade and investment explosion Mexico has enjoyed over the past two decades also owes a great deal to the country’s growing commitment to policy discipline.\n\nRecent developments here, with which you are all very familiar, are indeed impressive. A recent report by the World Bank praised Mexico for its recent economic reforms, achieving the top ranking among Latin American economies for having the most improved business climate.\n\nPrices have become more stable than ever. People can invest in Mexico without the considerable worry about inflation. An important ingredient in Mexico’s success on this front was the 1994 constitutional amendment that created a fully independent central bank with price stability as its main goal. With a clearly stated objective and constitutional protection, Banco de México has become a no-nonsense practitioner of inflation targeting, rightfully earning the respect of the international investment and monetary policy communities.\n\nOther policy changes have strengthened Mexico’s economy and reduced its vulnerability to financial crises. Fiscal responsibility and low budget deficits have brought well-deserved praise. This has enabled Mexico to greatly improve the composition of its debt. The government ran into trouble a decade ago in part because most of its debt was in foreign hands, dollar-denominated and short-term. In 1994, 85 percent of Mexico’s public debt was held outside the country. Today, the ratio is 40 percent. Emblematic of the effort to rely more on domestic sources of finance is the fact that Mexico was able to retire all its Brady debt three years ago, becoming the first country to do so.\n\nAt the same time, Mexico now borrows on better, longer terms than 10 years ago. In 1995, Mexico didn’t even have a yield curve. There was no market for Mexican bonds with more than a year to maturity. Recently, however, Mexico successfully issued 20-year fixed-rate, peso-denominated bonds, and the Ministry of Finance has announced it would start issuing 30-year bonds in the fourth quarter—a truly marvelous accomplishment.\n\nAnother important policy change involves exchange rates. I certainly don’t have to tell anyone in this room about the costs of past attempts to maintain a fixed currency value. A free-floating peso has helped Mexico’s economy adjust gradually to shifts in foreign trade and investment, preventing the buildup of the pressures that eventually show up as a sudden shock.\n\nGiven all this progress, Mexico’s financial markets have proven remarkably resilient during this turbulent election year. Past elections have given investors reason to be wary. The track record hadn’t been impressive as presidential transitions often sparked financial turmoil in Mexico as the change in power presented opportunities for new leaders to reconsider past commitments. In this election cycle, there have been few signs of investor anxiety, a testament to the new stability of Mexico’s fiscal house.\n\nGone are the days when my predecessors at the Federal Reserve or other analysts would warn of Mexico’s vulnerability to financial shocks. Today, concern focuses on the absence of badly needed structural reforms that would encourage long-term growth and competitiveness.\n\nThe list of needed reforms is well-known, and you hardly need a gringo to elucidate them. You would probably agree with me that Mexico would benefit tremendously from improvements in educational infrastructure and labor reforms. The economy could also use better enforcement of property rights and more effective tax laws. Implementing these reforms is the greatest challenge facing the new presidential administration.\n\nCritics of mine might venture that in my enthusiasm for Mexico I tend to gloss over the problem of corruption, which remains nettlesome for both Mexican citizens and foreign investors. I am well aware of it. Indeed, one of my favorite Cantinflas films was El Señor Fotógrafo. You may not remember it. The plotline concerns government corruption and, of course, with Cantinflas involved, the bad guys were routed in a highly comedic but determined fashion. I have high hopes that the example of a virtuous and independent central bank and other institutional reforms that have been put in place by the past two presidential administrations will continue the determined process of routing out corruption.\n\nIt would be un-Texan of me not to conclude with some words about my state and our unique relationship with the states of Mexico. If the Mexican and U.S. economies are joined at the hip, that would make the Texas economy the hip bone. Few U.S. states benefit more from Mexican purchases than Texas. The United States exported $120 billion in goods to Mexico in 2005, 42 percent of which were exported by Texas. Only 15 percent came from California. Overall, Texas exports grew nearly 4 percent in the second quarter of this year, following 5 percent growth in the first quarter. Texas is now the largest exporting state in the U.S., in no small part thanks to Mexico.\n\nFor most of its history, the Texas economy has grown faster than the United States as a whole and continues to do so today. This is to Mexico’s benefit.\n\nEven as the signs point to a slowing U.S. economy, Texas remains a shining star. In 2005, Texas gross state product increased at a rate of 4.3 percent, compared with 3.2 percent GDP growth for the U.S as a whole. We are adding jobs almost twice as fast as the rest of the country. Texas employment growth has been spread across many sectors, with almost all outperforming their national counterparts.\n\nSignificant to Mexico is the fact that the Texas construction industry is growing strongly. In the first quarter of 2005, our construction employment grew at an astounding 11.5 percent pace, followed by a 3.4 percent pace in the second quarter. Our latest reading from July and August suggests a 9.4 percent annual rate. Compare these growth rates to 4.3 percent for the construction industry across the rest of the U.S. in the first quarter and essentially no growth since then.\n\nAs real estate markets undergo a price correction across the country, our markets have not slowed nearly as much. On the whole, home sales have yet to turn downward in Texas. We are aware of the rising delinquency rates Texans are accruing on their mortgages. Only some of this is due to an oversubscription to those creative financing products I discussed a few minutes ago; mostly it is a result of high leverage coupled with slower appreciation. We do have an increasing inventory of new homes for sale, but the existing home market remains healthy, with increasing sales and some modest price gains.\n\nAs a whole, U.S. industrial production posted a 4.6 percent annual growth rate at last count. As you will see when we release the Dallas Fed’s Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey shortly after I conclude this speech, Texas manufacturing activity remains strong, with general business conditions and planned capital spending continuing to improve. Many factories are reporting increased production and healthy capacity utilization and volumes, although slightly less than what we were seeing a month ago. This should encourage you, particularly, for it implies continued prosperity for Mexico’s maquiladora sector. Employment in the maquiladoras all along your side of the border grew at an annualized pace of 9.4 percent last June, adding 37,800 jobs over the prior year, with an even more impressive pace among the towns closest to the Texas border.\n\nEstimados Amigos, me da mucho gusto estar aquí en Monterrey acompañado de Ustedes. Gracias por la oportunidad de hablarles sobre el tema de la economía de nuestros países. Como ya saben, México tiene un lugar muy especial en mi corazón. Y yo estoy seguro que, apoyándonos uno al otro, juntos podemos lograr un gran futuro. Como miembro del Comité Federal de Operaciones de Mercado Abierto de los Estados Unidos, espero poder trabajar con el Banco de México y con todos Ustedes, para asegurar un mejor futuro para nuestros hijos, tanto Mexicanos como Tejanos y Americanos. Gracias por su paciencia.",

            "content": "August 30, 2006 Dallas, Texas\n\nReal estate runs on borrowed money—so I suspect most of you keep a sharp eye on Federal Reserve policymaking and its effect on interest rates. At times, I am sure, we have made your business more difficult for you, but I urge you to keep in mind the Fed’s raison d’être. We are charged with maintaining the monetary conditions for sustainable, non-inflationary economic growth. Will Rogers once quipped that “the three greatest inventions of man were fire, the wheel and central banking.” Given the times, shortly after the failure of the Bank of the United States and the onset of the Great Depression, he just may have been striking a sarcastic note! Even so, the idea of an independent central bank like the Federal Reserve is, I think, an ingenious one.\n\nPresident Woodrow Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act in 1913. One of the more successful and brilliant aspects of this legislation was the creation of 12 regional banks that would influence monetary policymaking. Having representatives from all parts of the country brings a deeper, more diverse perspective to the policy debate, giving a clearer view of what is really happening in the U.S. economy.\n\nTexas lobbied Washington heavily to host one of the 12 regional banks. Dallas won out over Fort Worth and Houston, largely because of the efforts of Dallas Morning News publisher George B. Dealey. He rallied support for Dallas by recruiting influential Texans in Washington to back the city’s cause. Dealey’s emissaries succeeded by pleading their case before the Treasury secretary and President Wilson himself.\n\nDallas won its bid to become a Reserve Bank city on April 3, 1914, the same day, incidentally, that Pancho Villa’s forces captured the Mexican town of Torreón. Other notable events that year included the completion of the Panama Canal, the start of World War I and the invention of the air conditioner. I will leave it to you to decide whether that last one tops the Dallas Fed in importance to this great city’s development.\n\nFew Dallas institutions have survived as long as the Dallas Fed. We have been part of the downtown community since we opened, moving from temporary quarters to that stately building on Akard Street in 1921 and then to our current building on Pearl Street, just opposite the Arts District, in 1992. We have the third longest continuous business presence in downtown Dallas and are proud of it. Of the remaining downtown institutions, only the Morning News and Neiman Marcus predate our arrival in Dallas.\n\nThe Dallas Fed has been at its best in hard times. During the Great Depression, our employees voluntarily took 5 percent pay cuts so the Bank could share the work and hire unemployed Dallasites. In an earlier recession, panicked customers stampeded a Dallas bank, demanding to withdraw their money. It was the kind of run that could ruin a bank. The head of the Dallas Fed, a man named W. F. Ramsey, showed up in an armored car with guards. They hauled a quarter million dollars into the lobby—where everyone could see it. In a scene right out of It’s a Wonderful Life, Ramsey jumped on a desk and shouted across the crowded lobby that he had $30 million more sitting in the Fed’s vault down the street. Just like that, the bank run ended.\n\nThe Fed has come a long way from its early years. Today, we employ more than 1,300 people in Texas, almost a thousand of them in Dallas. Each year, the Dallas Fed processes 1 billion paper checks worth about $900 billion and between 240 million and 300 million electronic checks and handles 5.4 billion in circulating banknotes worth nearly $92 billion. We continue to supply the liquidity banking customers need in times of potential and real crises, such as Y2K, the aftermath of 9/11 and last year’s devastating hurricanes. Our operations require an underground vault the size of a five-story building—quite something, when you realize our vault was little more than an office safe in 1914.\n\nOur other responsibilities include supervising the banking industry within the Eleventh Federal Reserve District. We conduct on-site audits of our member banks and monitor bank performance and stability. We have public education programs designed to raise financial and economic literacy in our community and host many public events and conferences on significant activities within our economy. We maintain a first-rate research department that provides me with the authoritative economic analysis I need for my role on the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—as well as speeches like this one.\n\nI mean it when I say first-rate. Some of you may not know that Finn Kydland, an associate of our research team for the past 13 years, won the Nobel Prize for economics in 2004. Finn is with me this morning. Now, he is a Norwegian and is therefore genetically incapable of promoting or drawing attention to himself. Nevertheless, I am going to embarrass Finn and ask him to stand up and take a bow.\n\nOur current analysis points to an economy at a crossroads. High energy prices, rising interest rates and the slowdown in a red-hot housing market have taken some of the steam out of what had been a fairly robust expansion. At the same time, our current inflation indicators are not presently as well behaved as I would like them to be. Central bankers are always concerned when inflation starts to rear its ugly head. We know from experience that once inflation gains momentum, it becomes harder and harder to stop.\n\nAs you know from reading this morning’s papers, at our last meeting of the FOMC, we collectively decided to pause in raising the fed funds rate after 17 consecutive rounds of quarter-point tightenings. It was the collective judgment of the committee that we were at a juncture where it made sense to evaluate the lagged effect of these tightenings, especially on the inflationary impetus of the economy.\n\nHow do we define inflation, and how do we measure it? This is a question I want to discuss in depth with you today. Before I do, however, let me issue the usual disclaimer that today, as always, I speak only for myself, not for the Federal Open Market Committee, nor for any of the other committee members.\n\nInflation is an increase in the general price level. If prices for all goods and services went up in the same proportion, over some period of time—if all prices increased by, say, 2 percent over the past 12 months—there would be no difficulty in identifying the rate of inflation: It would be 2 percent a year. In reality, over any stretch of time, some prices will rise faster than others and some may actually decline. When we speak of inflation as a sustained increase in the “general level of prices,” we have in mind an increase in an average of all prices.\n\nThis average is more sophisticated than a simple arithmetic mean. We don’t want to treat a 10 percent increase in the price of pepper, for example, as having the same importance as a 10 percent increase in the price of shelter, clothing or transportation. So the formulas we use weight items by how important they are in people’s budgets.\n\nDifferences in weighting, and the scope of goods and services included, give rise to the various inflation measures we hear reported on radio and television broadcasts or read about in the papers. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) focuses on the prices of the goods and services consumed by a typical urban household. The price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) looks more broadly at all goods and services purchased for final consumption and, additionally, uses a more sophisticated weighting scheme than the CPI. Most broadly, the price index for gross domestic product, also known as the GDP deflator, looks at the prices of all goods and services produced in the economy; thus, it includes not just consumer goods, but also capital goods and government-provided services.\n\nNow, bear with me here.\n\nEach of these measures comes in two flavors: “headline” and “core.” The latter—the “core”—excludes prices for food and energy. The man on the street—someone known to occasionally purchase food and gas and air-condition or heat his home—often puzzles at policymakers’ focus on core inflation. To add to that man’s confusion, it is not uncommon for the press to report the same inflation numbers in different ways. When July’s CPI numbers were reported earlier this month, a Washington Post article stated, “The Labor Department reported yesterday that inflation rose last month, eating into people’s paychecks and savings at a quickening clip.” The same day, New York Times readers learned that “the government’s latest report on consumer prices, issued yesterday, suggests that inflation is slowing.” Both were right. The Post had focused on the headline rate, which had picked up relative to the month before, while the Times focused on the core rate, which had fallen a bit from prior months.\n\nPolicymakers and economists tend to focus on the core measures because they strip out volatile items and show more stability than headline inflation. The core measures give a better indication of the underlying inflationary trends that matter most in formulating policy.\n\nI have been using the word “core” as shorthand for “excluding food and energy,” and that is the common connotation. To be precise, however, “ex food and energy” measures are but one form of the core rate, and—according to research at the Dallas Fed, the Cleveland Fed and elsewhere—not even necessarily the best. The Dallas Fed has created a measure of core inflation called the Trimmed-Mean PCE inflation rate. It is calculated by stripping out the most volatile price movements each month, regardless of whether the items in question are food, energy or something else, in order to not be distracted by temporary price rises or declines and to enable us to focus instead on the underlying trend of inflation.\n\nThe Trimmed-Mean PCE in one month this past spring, for example, excluded guns, which were set aside because of a big price decline, and funeral expenses, deleted because of a big price increase. I won’t speculate on whether these price movements were related.\n\nCentral bankers abhor inflation and deflation. Our mantra is “price stability.” Taken literally, this means zero inflation. But our inflation measures are imperfect and likely biased upward, so many central bankers see price stability as a very low, though positive, rate of measured inflation. The point is to have an inflation rate that is, in its economic effects, essentially zero. Stated differently, we seek to create the monetary conditions for an economy where inflation is not distorting anyone’s decisions.\n\nWhy do we value price stability? Somewhere in France, there is—or at least there used to be—a rod that precisely defines a meter. It is quite useful to know that the length of that rod is constant from one month to the next, one year to the next. This is the only way to ensure that those 10-meter doohickeys that are on order, when they arrive, will fit with the 10-meter doodads you already have on hand. The best situation is a rod that doesn’t change—“meter stability,” if you will. Next best would be a rod that changed in predictable ways—say, a rod known to grow by 2 percent a year. Setting aside the question of where—after many years—one would keep such a rod, people could at least confidently plan for the future. The worst case, of course, would be a rod that changed unpredictably—some months growing by “X” percent, some months actually shrinking. Manufacturers and others, like the people who organize marathons, would expend resources attempting to predict changes in the rod’s length—resources that could have been put to more productive use. And still, at the end of the day, some of their plans would come to naught because of unforeseen variations. You couldn’t build a new house under those circumstances, or a factory, or a school, or practically anything else.\n\nInflation is a bit like having a measuring stick that grows or shrinks from one month to the next; the “doohickeys” and “doodads” that need to fit together, in this case, are prices for money or goods today and in the future. You get the picture. The consequences of a randomly varying dollar value would be severe. It doesn’t take a Finn Kydland to conclude that low and predictable inflation is preferable to high and variable inflation and that low and predictable inflation should be the goal of your central bank.\n\nThe evidence suggests central bankers have had some success in that pursuit. In the U.S. and elsewhere, inflation has been brought down to near-negligible levels and has become more predictable in the past 20 years.\n\nIn 1993, a great economist named John Taylor proposed a simple rule for conducting monetary policy. He recommended setting interest rates based on two inputs: first, the deviation of actual inflation from the central bank’s desired rate and, second, a measure of the economy’s excess capacity, usually called the “output gap.” The Taylor rule recommends raising nominal interest rates—that is, tightening monetary policy—whenever inflation is above its target or output is temporarily above its long-term potential.\n\nThe Taylor rule begat the Taylor principle, which recommends how much to tighten in response to a given deviation of inflation from its target. It suggests that increases in nominal interest rates need to be greater than the rise in inflation. In response to a 1 percentage point increase in inflation, for example, the principle might prescribe a 1.5 percentage point increase in nominal interest rates. If you do the math, you will see that a rise in inflation has been met with an increase in the real, or inflation-adjusted, interest rate. Higher real interest rates act as a tap on the economy’s brakes, slowing the pace of real activity and reducing upward pressure on prices.\n\nJohn Taylor originally formulated his rule as a prescription for policymakers. But it turns out that, at least since the mid-1980s, the Taylor rule is a good description of how the Fed has conducted monetary policy. While the Fed has never bound itself to any explicit policy rule, its de facto adherence to the Taylor principle since the mid-1980s has paid off handsomely in terms of achieving price stability. Inflation measured by the PCE price index averaged about 7 percent in the 1970s, 4.5 percent in the 1980s and 2.2 percent in the 1990s and through the first half of this decade.\n\nIn the simplest version of the Taylor rule, current inflation is the primary determinant of a central bank’s policy actions. In the real world, policymakers look at many other indicators to gauge inflationary pressures before they show up in actual inflation rates. This makes sense, given the lags between policy actions and their ultimate effects on the economy—lags that economist Milton Friedman famously described as “long and variable.”\n\nAmong the additional variables we look at are measures of capacity utilization of business operators and tightness in the labor market—for example, the unemployment rate. Strong job growth will lead to demands for higher pay. Many of you might wonder why that could ever be bad. Well, when it comes to workers’ pay and benefits, it is not the increases themselves that cause concern. Problems occur when labor costs rise faster than gains in labor productivity. When that happens, firms often see shrinking profit margins, which add to pressure to raise product prices. What policymakers look at is unit labor costs, a measure of workers’ pay adjusted for productivity.\n\nEven if we cull out the misleading signals, the traditional data set may no longer be sufficient. At the Dallas Fed, we are exploring the notion that capacity measures must be extended beyond the domestic market. Today, we live in a world where goods, services, money, and the ideas and tasks performed by American businesses cross international borders with great ease. It stands to reason, then, that inflationary trends in any economy cannot be properly assessed without knowing how readily resources, inputs, finished products and capital from outside the country can be brought to bear. The Dallas Fed’s globalization initiative is aimed at developing measures of these broader output gaps, which we hope will let us determine how the dramatic rise of China and India, for example, or the processing of tasks in cyberspace will impact inflation in the U.S.\n\nMonetary policy does not give central banks a lever to control inflation directly. In focusing on interest rates, the FOMC influences demand for credit, which in turn affects growth and inflation. At any given time, of course, all sectors of the economy may not be in sync, adding great complexity to the art of central banking. In the early part of this decade, the Fed was concerned about the deflationary impact of the high-tech investment bust, and it responded by lowering interest rates on overnight, short-term borrowing by member banks. In the past three years, we reversed much of that stimulus, at first because investment began recovering and more recently because inflation was at risk of becoming uncomfortably high.\n\nWhich brings us to the subject dear to your hearts—real estate. On the national level, recent data indicate that housing markets weakened further in mid-summer. The holy trinity of housing reports—starts, existing-home sales and new-home sales—all came in much weaker in July than expected by mainstream economists, with inventories of unsold homes continuing to rise. Stepping back to include weakness shown before last month, permits and new-home sales are down about 20 percent from a year ago.\n\nThe declines are moving housing markets from very high and unsustainable levels toward more normal levels, unwinding some speculative activity. We are monitoring the effect this will have on the economy with due respect for its gravity. But it is not a one-sided deal; not all the consequences of the unwinding of a bull market in housing are bad. For example, a beneficial side effect of slower demand is that upward pressures on housing prices are abating. The pace of home-price appreciation has slowed dramatically—from double-digit year-over-year rates last fall to low single digits in recent readings. As prices cool off, we may finally begin the long process of allowing income to catch up with housing costs, helping make homes more affordable in the long run.\n\nLet me give you an example of what I am referring to. In 1999, 43 percent of the residents of Los Angeles could afford a median-priced home. By the end of last year, only 2 percent could. For New York, the comparable figures were 55 percent that could afford a median-priced home in 1999 and 6 percent in 2006. The figures for Dallas, incidentally, were unchanged over the period. At the end of last year, 62 percent of Dallasites could afford a median-priced home, which explains why our local housing market is holding up better than the markets on the West and East coasts.\n\nWith home-price appreciation no longer running rampant, we are likely to see fewer homeowners tapping into their home equity, which had been fueling a consumption boom and diverting savings from investment. From a broader perspective, the slowing of housing and consumption frees up resources for investment and a more balanced economy. Some good news can be found by looking carefully at durable goods orders, which foreshadow private investment. Their recent rise suggests that businesses are starting to increase their capacity following the investment bust a few years back. Spending on plant and equipment is crucial to supporting productivity growth, the source of long-term gains in living standards.\n\nThe stirring of business investment has helped spark a revival in commercial real estate construction to accommodate the many firms aiming to expand their workspaces. Indeed, we may be seeing the start of a great rotation away from household spending to investment and to more healthy and balanced growth. In setting monetary policy, we assess inflationary pressures and gauge aggregate demand by adding up some sectors that are weakening, like housing, along with sectors that are expanding, like commercial construction and investment.\n\nI will wrap up by bringing things closer to home—the Texas and Dallas real estate markets, which diverge from national trends, particularly on the housing side. The housing markets all across Texas are healthy compared with the rest of the U.S. While we have seen some signs of cooling, traffic and sales are still strong. We are hearing more reports of cancellations, mostly attributed to relocation buyers not being able to sell their West Coast homes. This is not “Texas brag.” If you listen to business leaders in El Paso, for example, you will hear them say that West Texas is being invaded by two forces: the U.S. Army and Californians. The consolidation of military bases in the El Paso area, combined with relocators from Southern California, is changing the character of once-sleepy El Paso.\n\nThroughout the state, housing starts outpaced sales in the second quarter, despite record-setting sales figures. And our apartment markets have improved along with the economy. So far this year, apartment demand is keeping up with supply, helping vacancy rates stay around 10 percent in most Texas markets. We are hearing reports of strong office-leasing activity from both local and relocating firms, as well as increasing requests for large blocks of office space. Office, industrial and warehouse rents are picking up, along with construction activity in several areas in Texas, especially in Dallas. We are also hearing numerous reports of the difficulty developers are having finding construction workers as well as rising pressure on wages.\n\nIn the Metroplex, the housing market has been quite strong for over five years. Dallas–Fort Worth has ranked in the top four among U.S. metropolitan areas in single-family permits since 2000. New-home sales set records in the first and second quarters of 2006, while existing-home sales cooled a bit. Year-to-date existing-home sales are flat compared with last year, and July sales were down 10 percent. The median price of homes in the area, however, is still rising modestly. Apartment markets are relatively healthy, with occupancies above 90 percent and three consecutive quarters of modest rent hikes.\n\nDallas’ office market has made a comeback in the past few years, but that really does not show up in vacancy rates, presently ranked second highest in the U.S. Interestingly, Dallas’ commercial vacancy rate is about 23 percent, while Fort Worth’s is 6 percent. Despite the ranking, demand for space is increasing, and large blocks are diminishing in certain submarkets. Construction has increased dramatically, especially in downtown Dallas, Uptown and Far North Dallas. Our contacts are convinced that occupancy, demand and rents in these areas justify the pace of construction. The industrial market continues to improve, with most of the gains coming from the warehouse side. The retail market has benefited from the strong housing market over the past several years, but demand appears to have ebbed recently, giving cause for caution. However, retail vacancies remain relatively low, at about 10 percent, and construction activity is up strongly.\n\nA word of caution is in order, however, because national trends do have an impact on the local market. Nationally, there is a lot of cash in capital markets looking for sustainable projects to be invested in. The result is that capitalization rates have been pushed down, raising concern among some industry analysts, especially in a condominium market that seems to reflect an excess of supply relative to demand at the margin. We have seen the effect of this here in Dallas with the cancellation of some high-profile building or conversion plans, and I expect there will be more.\n\nI hope my comments have been a good start on today’s proceedings. Subsequent speakers will, I am sure, provide more detailed information on Metroplex real estate trends. Before leaving, though, I want to remind you that North Texas owes its prosperity to the legions of vital and entrepreneurial businesswomen and men who grew up here or came here. People like you. You dare to dream. You are not afraid to take risks. You are a large part of what makes Dallas what it is.\n\nLet me put this in perspective. We read a lot these days about India and its barnstorming economy. India has an extraordinary cadre of brilliant and hardworking people. India’s economic prowess grabs a lot of headlines. And yet consider this: The 24 million people of Texas produce 20 percent more output than the 1.1 billion people of India. The Texas economy is a fifth larger than India’s. That’s because of hardworking risk takers like you. The Federal Reserve does its level best to maintain monetary conditions necessary for sustainable non-inflationary growth. But you, and the businessmen and women of America, are the ones that make that growth happen and secure our prosperity. God bless you.",

            "content": "August 29, 2006 San Antonio, Texas\n\nMy name is Richard Fisher, and as the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, I want to thank you for joining me and my colleagues today for this informal community luncheon.\n\nI spent a great deal of time here in 1994 during what I have come to call my midlife crisis, when I lost control of my better judgment and ran for the U.S. Senate. Two positive things came out of my unsuccessful efforts on the campaign trail: First, Texans elected themselves a talented senator in Kay Bailey Hutchison; and second, well, about all I accomplished was the unique distinction of being the only person to eat at every Dairy Queen in the great state of Texas, including at the 21 DQs right here in Bexar County. I like to say that I labored in the vineyards of politics but all it yielded for me was prune juice. The truth is it yielded a lot of Blizzards, Dilly Bars and Dip Cones, and about 10 extra pounds.\n\nI am especially delighted to see Tom Frost in the audience today. Of course, you all know the special relationship Frost Bank has with San Antonio. Tom also has a very special relationship with the Dallas Fed and our branch office here in San Antonio. In keeping with his family tradition of being a friend to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Tom has been a trusted advisor to our bank since 1967, having served a total of 12 years on the boards of directors of our Dallas and San Antonio offices and another three and a half years on our Federal Advisory Council. And thanks to Tom, Dick Evans—the talented CEO of Cullen Frost—serves on our board today, always providing a keen and insightful view from San Antonio.\n\nSo rich is the Frost family’s involvement with the Dallas Fed that earlier generations served on our original organizing committee in 1914, after the Federal Reserve Act was signed by President Woodrow Wilson in 1913. Twelve Reserve Districts were to be set up around the country, with the Eleventh District to be headquartered in Dallas. When the San Antonio Branch opened in 1927, it was housed in leased office space in the Frost National Bank Building. The local newspaper thought that was pretty good stuff and wrote that having a Fed outpost here “had changed San Antonio from a financial water-hole to a financial roundup.”\n\nTom, thank you for being here today, and thank you for all you and your family have done to help the Federal Reserve, the Eleventh District, this city, our great state and our country.\n\nBefore lunch, I had the pleasure of meeting with the presidents of many of the banks located in the San Antonio and Austin metropolitan areas. They were kind enough to share their observations, impressions and concerns about what is happening in the local economy. I learned a great deal from their thoughtful comments. Both cities play important roles in promoting Texas’ economic health, and I have gained a better understanding of why they continue to grow faster than other parts of the state.\n\nThe local banking sector is doing very well. A total of 180 financial institutions operate in the greater Austin and San Antonio areas, with more than 850 branches holding $58 billon in assets. Just as important, 95 percent of these banks were profitable during the first half of this year. These banks report strong growth in loans for commercial real estate and construction and land development over the past four years.\n\nLet me say a word about Austin, as it appears to me that over time, from a commercial standpoint, the capital and San Antonio are increasingly blending together and playing off one another in just the right way. Austin is the state’s high-tech capital and a world leader in innovation. Austin’s second-quarter venture capital investment was more than double what it was a year ago, and the city ranks third in the country behind Silicon Valley and the Boston area in this vital measure of technological prowess. In a typical year, Austin residents and companies top all other tech centers except Silicon Valley in patents granted. Firms from around the country and around the world are relocating to Austin, attracted by the city’s well-educated and highly skilled workforce, advanced technological infrastructure and cost advantages. A recent survey by Expansion magazine ranked Austin as the most attractive city in the country for future business relocations.\n\nSan Antonio is booming. Amen. Employment has been growing at a healthy pace—at 4 percent last year—because of expansion in health care, financial services and manufacturing. When Toyota opens its new plant this fall, factory jobs will get another shot in the arm. The leisure and hospitality sector continues to provide a stable base for the local economy, and San Antonio is on track for one of its best convention years since 2001. Military spending has long been an important driver for San Antonio, and the National Security Agency’s new facility will have significant spillovers. Besides the obvious benefits to housing and retail, it will also boost education programs at the area’s universities.\n\nBut maybe we shouldn’t talk too much about the NSA. They might be listening.\n\nI don’t know whether the NSA is listening, but as you can see, the press is here, so you can bet that some one is listening. When I give a speech, I am aware that many come to extract clues about which way interest rates are going to move. I don’t expect today will be any different, so let me issue the usual disclaimer that I speak only for myself, not for the Federal Open Market Committee, nor for any of the other committee members. And let me assure you that I will consider this a successful speech if I manage to convey no clues whatsoever on the interest rate front.\n\nA couple of days ago, I told another audience that our economy is at a crossroads, an opinion that has not changed. Using the word “crossroads” brought to mind a story about William McChesney Martin, who served as Federal Reserve Board chairman longer than anyone, even Alan Greenspan. The Alfalfa Club is one of the great institutions in Washington, D.C. Once a year, it holds a dinner devoted solely to poking fun at the political pretensions of the day. Tongue firmly in cheek, the club nominates a candidate to run for the presidency on the Alfalfa Party ticket. Of course, none of them ever win. Nominees are thenceforth known for evermore as members of the Stassen Society, named for Harold Stassen, who ran for president nine times and lost every time, then ran a tenth time on the Alfalfa ticket and lost again. The motto of the group is “Veni, Vidi, Defici,” a phrase loosely taken from the Latin for “I came, I saw, I lost.”\n\nBill Martin was nominated to run on the Alfalfa Party ticket in 1966, while serving as Fed chairman under his fourth president. In his acceptance speech, he announced in jest that, given his proclivities as a central banker, he was taking his cues from the German philosopher Goethe, “who said that people could endure anything except continual prosperity.” Therefore, Martin continued, he would adopt a platform proclaiming that as a president he planned to “make life endurable again, by stamping out prosperity.”\n\n“I shall conduct the administration of the country,” he said, “exactly as I have so successfully conducted the affairs of the Federal Reserve. To that end, I shall assemble the best brains that can be found…ask their advice on all matters…and completely confound them by following all their conflicting counsel.” Martin told his audience that “America is at the crossroads. And I shall do everything I can do to keep it there.”\n\nMartin gave his Alfalfa Club speech 52 years after Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act and President Woodrow Wilson signed it into law so as to encourage, not stamp out, economic prosperity. One of the more successful and brilliant aspects of this legislation was the creation of the 12 regional banks. The Fed could have been set up solely in Washington, like so many other institutions of the central government. Having representatives from all parts of the country, however, brings a deeper, more diverse perspective (and occasional “conflicting counsel”!) to the policy debate at the meetings of the Open Market Committee when we collectively determine monetary policy, giving a clearer view of what is really happening in the U.S. economy. The regional banks maintain branch offices in cities within their district to stay in touch with local economic conditions and business leaders. Indeed, our view of things from Dallas is greatly enhanced by the efforts of our distinguished branch directors and outstanding staff in San Antonio, who keep a watchful eye on economic trends in the city, Austin and South Texas.\n\nOf course, the sexy bits of the Federal Reserve—or at least the stuff that the press and the markets seem to find seductive and just can’t seem to get enough of—deal with monetary policy. But to really understand us, you need to know a little about the businesses we operate as a part of the central bank of the United States. Let me tell you about the business of the Eleventh Federal Reserve District, all derived from our charter to maintain and protect the monetary system our citizens rely on.\n\nI have the privilege of representing the more than 1,300 people who work at the Dallas Fed and our branches in San Antonio, Houston and El Paso. One of our duties is to process checks. We process 1 billion paper checks a year, worth about $900 billion. Every day, we handle 4.3 million paper checks. Processing these checks requires us to sort them into 1,748 different stacks, each belonging to a different bank in our district or other districts. Due to advances in technology, many banks now send us checks electronically in a digital format. We receive and process between 800,000 and 1.1 million electronic images each day. Not all banks have converted to electronic processing, so we have to re-create physical checks from the electronic images. On average, we print out 506,000 electronic checks each day and add them to our bank stacks.\n\nIn addition to processing checks, we provide the blood supply—the currency—that flows through the veins and capillaries of a sprawling district that, if it were a country, would be the 12th largest economy in the world, producing some 20 percent more output than India. We supply the liquidity banking customers need in good times and bad, and we work double time—overtime in times of trauma, such as Y2K, September 11, 2001, and last year’s devastating hurricanes—to keep the heart of the Texas economy pumping.\n\nEven in these days of credit and debit cards and electronic payments, you can’t overstate the importance of cash. When I was a student at Oxford, the great insurance magnate, Clement Stone, came to speak at the Oxford Union. A student asked him to kindly share with those of us in the audience what he considered the key to success. He looked out at the audience, curled up his Ronald Coleman mustache and said: “In one word: cash.” Well, the Dallas Fed stores and circulates a lot of it. Our main vault in Dallas is the size of a five-story building.\n\nIf you ever need to do your laundry or park at a meter, call me. Our vaults contain more than 150 million quarters.\n\nAnd lots of dollar bills. We distribute and receive 5.4 billion circulating banknotes each year, worth nearly $92 billion. That’s almost $400 million in cash passing through our offices every day. This is a thing of beauty to watch. The mammoth machines scan the cash at a rate of 90,000 bills per hour. They cull out about 825 counterfeit bills each month. They pluck out almost 40 million worn bills each month—valued at $517 million—and send them off to Money Heaven. The life span of a typical $1 bill, incidentally, is just 18 months. A $20 bill lasts four years, and a $100 bill lasts nine.\n\nAmong the regional banks’ other responsibilities is supervising the banking industry within our respective districts. We conduct on-site audits of our member banks and monitor bank performance and stability measures using electronic surveillance technologies. We have also launched public education programs designed to raise financial and economic literacy in our community, and we host public events and conferences on significant activities within our economy.\n\nAnd we do serious economic research, designed to provide the intellectual heft for informed monetary policymaking. Our Research Department employs two dozen crack economists who study the local, national and international economies. Their work is top-notch. Few of you might know, for example, that Finn Kydland, an associate of our research team in Dallas for the past 13 years, won the Nobel Prize in economics in 2004.\n\nWe have spread our research function to our branches. In addition to tracking trends across Texas, our economists here in San Antonio and in Houston and El Paso maintain a keen interest in Mexico and the many ways its economy commingles with ours. The reason is simple: Understanding Texas’ economy requires an appreciation of Mexico’s. The two are joined at the hip.\n\nI am encouraged by much of what I see on the economic front in Mexico. Its economy has been growing strongly for three years now. Preliminary estimates show that Mexico’s real GDP grew at a 4.7 percent annual rate in the second quarter, and it would have been higher if so many Mexicans had not been on vacation for the Holy Week holidays. A total of 833,000 jobs were added to the formal sector in the first half of 2006, the fastest employment growth rate in nine years.\n\nThere are other positives. Inflation has been tamed. Mexico’s headline consumer price index has declined to about 3 percent, its lowest level in 30 years and below the rates recently reported in the U.S. The banking sector is thriving. Low interest rates, pent-up demand for consumer credit and mortgages and financial institutions’ greater willingness to lend has fueled a borrowing boom. Mexico’s banks expect loan growth of 25 percent in 2006. The peso is steady. More than a decade ago, Mexico quit the fool’s errand of trying to fix the value of its currency, and a free-floating peso has been a source of stability, not only in Mexico but in South Texas as well.\n\nWhat is most impressive to me, however, is how the international financial community has not retreated from Mexico, despite the turmoil and uncertainty surrounding the recent presidential election. Mexico’s risk premium seems to have settled to around 120 basis points over similar U.S. Treasury bonds. Foreign investors feel, as I do, that Mexico has come to understand the value of pursuing sound macroeconomic policies, cemented by the constitutional reforms that secured the independence of Banco de México in 1994. Indeed, at the retreat we just had in Jackson Hole last weekend with our colleagues from all over the world, the governor of the central bank, Guillermo Ortiz, noted their research has concluded that had Mexico had in place the mechanisms needed to avoid the policy mistakes they experienced in the 1970s through the mid-1990s, per capita income in Mexico would be some two-thirds larger than it is today. This kind of frank acknowledgment and determination to not go back to the bad old days shows a level of sophistication that undergirds market confidence.\n\nThis is not to say there is no room for improvements in Mexico. Without serious reforms to Mexico’s inadequate education system, rigid labor laws and poorly enforced contracts and property rights, the country will not live up to its full economic potential. But I believe that with each step Mexico takes toward these needed reforms, the benefits will become obvious on both sides of the border.\n\nAnother area where the researchers at the Dallas Fed are on the cutting edge involves the ongoing effort to better understand the phenomenon of inflation. To this end, we have developed a new way of measuring changes in prices that can assist monetary policymakers in assessing the direction and speed of approaching inflationary winds.\n\nI’m going to talk at length about inflation tomorrow in a speech in Dallas, but let me give you a quick brief on the subject.\n\nCentral bankers abhor inflation. We do so viscerally; it is part of our DNA. We know, just as all of you know, that inflation will eat away at an economy’s foundation by sapping the purchasing power of money and making less valuable those 5.4 billion bank notes that pass through our vaults. Once inflation gets a head of steam, it becomes difficult to bring back under control without a dose of harsh monetary medicine. Our job at the Fed is to make sure that does not happen, so the economy stands a better chance of achieving sustainable, long-term, non-inflationary growth.\n\nEvery business school grad knows you cannot control what you cannot measure. This applies to inflation as well as to the operations of any factory or office. You are all no doubt familiar with the Consumer Price Index, the CPI, which receives widespread coverage as it comes out each month. It measures the price changes for a basket of goods consumed by the typical urban American household over time.\n\nMany economists have lost confidence in the CPI as an inflation gauge. Objections have arisen about the goods included in the basket and the statistical weights assigned to each of them. In its place, many economists and monetary policymakers look at the personal consumption expenditure deflator, or PCE. The PCE doesn’t study a hypothetical basket of goods, but measures what we actually spend our money on.\n\nStandard PCE formulas come in two varieties. The first formula gives us the “headline” inflation number, which counts all the goods and services we buy. Weather and other temporary or seasonal conditions, however, often cause significant volatility in the prices of food and energy products, which clouds the picture when you are trying to judge longer term sustainable trends. Including these skittish items can produce a distorted picture, where real inflationary signals cannot be discerned because of statistical noise that might lead policymakers to faulty conclusions. To guard against this, analysts look at a PCE formula that excludes food and energy products, leaving what is called core inflation.\n\nThere are critics of reliance on this measure for the purposes of developing monetary policy. Many of you may have read in yesterday’s Financial Times or heard on National Public Radio that at Jackson Hole an official of the Bank of England had some pungent comments about the wisdom of removing energy from the PCE in an era of sustained upward movement in oil prices driven by new demand and the tectonic shifts that have taken place since China, India and others got on the stick. And other central banks take a very different approach.\n\nIn preparing for our deliberations at the FOMC, I have come to rely upon what is called the Trimmed-Mean PCE Deflator. This was developed by our own economics team under the leadership of a clever fellow named Jim Dolmas.\n\nInstead of routinely excluding food and energy, the Trimmed-Mean PCE Deflator recognizes that people have to eat, drive and air-condition their homes. Dramatic movements in food and energy prices may be a noisy distortion for econometricians, but these movements have a real impact on people’s consumption decisions. To be sure, a temporary blip in the prices of any of these essential goods should not be treated as permanent and might well distort one’s reading of underlying inflationary impulses. Indeed, in making policy, it strikes me as wise to be wary of any and all temporary distortions and to concentrate instead on underlying trends that condition expectations for future inflation. Thus, the Trimmed-Mean PCE sets aside whichever goods display the sharpest price movements up or down so that extreme—but temporary—price fluctuations do not obscure our vision.\n\nThe latest trimmed-mean readings are for June and suggest a base inflation rate of 2.7 percent for the previous 12 months.\n\nThe business of getting it right on inflation is not an easy task. I keep a close eye on all of the inflation measures—especially now, when high energy prices and utility bills are putting pressure on many businesses to raise prices. But I put extra weight on the Trimmed-Mean PCE Deflator because I believe it provides a more realistic picture of the price pressures in the economy and more accurately measures what conditions the operations of our economy.\n\nI would like for you to be aware of one other item on our research agenda. I came to the Dallas Fed with a belief that we cannot truly understand price pressures in the U.S. without taking into account developments outside the country. Just as Mexico is joined at the hip with Texas and Texas is part of the United States, the U.S. economy is inextricably linked with the rest of the world. I know this viscerally as a former trade negotiator. But our linkage with the rest of the world goes beyond just the import of goods and services and the standard textbook formula for adding net exports to the calculation of our gross domestic product. U.S. businesses source product and processes and tasks to wherever they can be secured at the lowest cost and with the greatest efficacy, whether it is in San Antonio or Shanghai. And the capital markets that businesses and governments depend upon to finance their operations are truly globalized, operating 24/7. This all affects the gearing of our businesses and the overall gearing of the U.S. economy. We can see this with the naked eye.\n\nHowever, we do not really know just how this heightened interlinkage with the rest of the world should affect the making of monetary policy at the Federal Reserve. And so the Dallas Fed has taken upon itself the job of contemplating how globalization impacts us. We have only just started our work on this front, but we have begun to observe some aspects of globalization that impact economic activity and price movements on our front porch.\n\nFor example, we know that capacity utilization abroad is rising, a trend that may well have implications for our inflation rate here at home. The U.S. economy, of course, remains a Goliath, producing roughly a quarter of the world’s output. So when our economy slows, it takes some steam out of the global engine. Other economies, however, have retooled and restructured to rid themselves of impediments that had been retarding growth for the past decade or more—in the case of China, since Mao took power in the 1940s, or in India, since the days of the Raj.\n\nThe changes have started to pay big dividends. The European Union economies are growing at rates not seen in some six years. For the first time in a decade, industry surveys in Japan, the world’s second-largest economy, are finding capacity constraints. China’s second-quarter growth came in at 11.3 percent, the fastest yet in an already remarkable decade and another indication that this emerging giant may be straining at its capacity. And India has been clocking growth rates over 8 percent.\n\nA global boom has been under way for four years now, ignited in no small degree by the easy monetary policy that began in 2001. There was a bit of a lag before it kicked in, but when it did, it kicked in big-time all over the world. Global GDP has been growing at roughly a 5 percent annual rate, eclipsing the U.S. average of 4 percent. Excess global capacity has been increasingly absorbed, even as capitalists rush to retool and expand that capacity.\n\nTaken together, these developments suggest the relationship between supply and demand for inputs of all sorts is becoming tighter, a fact of life our businesswomen and men are encountering on a daily basis as they search the globe for the inputs they need to keep production up and costs down.\n\nWe all know about the boom in commodity prices. Let me give you another example of how global growth is affecting resource utilization. According to a shipping industry leader, some of the world’s fleet of large, ocean-going ships are being pulled into duty moving bulk cargo from one Chinese port to another. It may be that only 1 or 2 percent of the fleet has been reassigned to China, but daily shipping rates have been rising at a time of the year when they’re usually softening. They are roughly two times what they were a year ago. It now costs more for importers to ship goods to the U.S., an illustration of how global growth can impact prices here at home.\n\nWe are going to see more of this, not less, as the rest of the world continues to adapt.\n\nOf course, economic theories and models dealing with global influences have been around for hundreds of years. We have David Ricardo, Francis Edgeworth, Paul Samuelson and many others to thank for setting the economics profession on an ever-improving path for better understanding the global aspects of economics. I would posit, immodestly, that the models and analytical tools used by the Federal Reserve are some of the most sophisticated and practicable ever developed. The problem is that our tool kit needs to continue expanding to deal with today’s rapidly changing manifestation of globalization. Tremendous complexity is required to capture the sophisticated working and resulting impacts of the changes we are experiencing, and we need to continue to push the envelope in order to fully understand how to make monetary policy in the world that is and will be rather than the world that was.",

            "content": "August 16, 2006 Dallas, Texas\n\nI was really enjoying that introduction until you had to be thorough and remind this great group of folks of my midlife crisis: my run for the United States Senate in 1994. All is well that ends well. We have a great senator in Kay Bailey Hutchison, and I am much happier at the Federal Reserve, which, thankfully, is a million miles from the world of partisan politics. Amen.\n\nBy raising politics, though, you’ve reminded me of the Alfalfa Club and given me a bridge to what I want to talk about today.\n\nThe Alfalfa Club is one of the great Washington institutions. It holds a dinner every year that is devoted solely to poking fun at the political pretensions of the day. Tongue firmly in cheek, the club nominates a candidate to run for the presidency on the Alfalfa Party ticket. Of course, none of them ever win. Nominees are thenceforth known for evermore as members of the Stassen Society, named for Harold Stassen, who ran for president nine times and lost every time, then ran a tenth time on the Alfalfa ticket and lost again. The motto of the group, which I adopted after only one outing to describe my own misplaced run for the Senate, is “Veni, Vidi, Defici,” which is loosely taken from the Latin for “I came, I saw, I lost.”\n\nSeveral of our fellow Texans have had the dubious honor of receiving the Alfalfa nomination, among them John Connally, Bob Strauss and Lloyd Bentsen, and also, well before they were elected president in the real deal, both “Bush 41” and our current president.\n\nAmong the alumni of the Stassen Society dearest to my heart is William McChesney Martin. Bill Martin holds the record for serving the longest as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board—even longer than Alan Greenspan. In 1966, while serving as Fed chairman under his fourth president, Martin was nominated to run for the presidency on the Alfalfa Party ticket. In his acceptance speech, he announced in jest that, given his proclivities as a central banker, he was taking his cues from the German philosopher Goethe, “who said that people could endure anything except continual prosperity.” Therefore, Bill Martin announced, if he were to adopt a political platform as a presidential candidate, he planned to “make life endurable again, by stamping out prosperity.” “I shall conduct the administration of the country,” he said, “exactly as I have so successfully conducted the affairs of the Federal Reserve. To that end, I shall assemble the best brains that can be found…ask their advice on all matters…and completely confound them by following all their conflicting counsel…. I say to you that America is at the crossroads. And I shall do everything I can do to keep it there.” [1]\n\nPundits and commentators have been bombarding you with interpretations of the last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), where committee members collectively decided to not raise the federal funds rate after having done so 17 consecutive times in quarter-point increments. These same commentators are also spending a great deal of time and space divining the intentions of our committee under the new chairmanship of Ben Bernanke. With all that analysis floating around, I thought I would share with you today my own views on the present predicament of the economy and monetary policy, as one of the 18 individuals who sit at that table offering “conflicting counsel” to the chairman of the Federal Reserve.\n\nIn suffering through all this, please remember that I speak only for myself as one participant on the FOMC. I speak only for the view from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, not for the committee or for any of the other Bank presidents and governors on the committee. Each of us always speaks as an individual, and I adhere to that convention today.\n\nLet us start with the real estate markets, the subject nearest and dearest to your hearts.\n\nCommercial real estate markets have generally returned to more normal conditions since the boom-bust at the start of this century. After falling in the early 2000s, for example, apartment rents have risen moderately, first in high-home-price coastal areas of the country and later in inland areas such as Dallas. Retail rents have more than recovered from the declines of the early part of the decade, particularly on the East and West coasts. By the end of 2005 they were rising at a 5 to 6 percent pace in cities like Dallas and Houston. And national office rents have been rising moderately in nominal terms, as office vacancy rates have been absorbed by an expanding economy. All told, commercial market rents have recently been rising in an expanding national economy and have shifted from a disinflationary to a slightly re-inflationary factor affecting the U.S. economy.\n\nAlthough rents have risen, prices for commercial properties have risen by more, perhaps reflecting the ample amount of liquidity in the capital markets looking for a place to be invested. In plain English, a lot of moola is out there chasing a limited number of sustainable projects. The result is that capitalization rates have been pushed down, raising concern among some industry analysts, especially in a condominium market that seems to reflect a disconnect between demand and supply at the margin. We have seen the effect locally with the cancellation of some high-profile building or conversion plans, and I expect there will be more.\n\nThe key area of concern in the real estate markets is the housing market. You know the facts here, so I’ll make this brief by repeating what a friend who has been a major homebuilder since 1973 recently told me: “This is the roughest, most sudden correction we have ever seen in the housing market.”\n\nIt may comfort you to know that of all the markets in America, Texas’ is among the most resilient. In fact, so far this year, single-family permits are up 11 percent from their year-ago pace—the third fastest growth rate among the 50 states and a sharp contrast to the 7 percent year-to-date decline for the U.S. as a whole. Much of our state’s strength reflects the pro-growth climate and low land prices that Texas has to offer.\n\nBut in making monetary policy for the nation, this provides scant comfort for the Federal Reserve. Nationwide, single-family permits are down 26 percent from the peak last September. We are well aware that consumption drives 70 percent of the nation’s economic growth and that a significant slug of the purchasing power of consumers has in the last few years been greatly enhanced by refinancing their mortgages in a rising-price market. During an expansion homebuilders propel the economy forward by creating jobs and buying lumber and other inputs. So we are watching the effect of the inventory correction in housing with due regard for its gravity. Builders are responding as one would expect: They are cutting staff, renegotiating prices and getting concessions from subcontractors, and either walking away from or renegotiating planned land purchases and other contracts. This is disinflationary activity that impacts economic growth.\n\nThere is one factor that distinguishes this housing market correction from previous ones, in addition to its suddenness and depth. The industry has consolidated since the last great correction in 1991. Fewer big builders now account for more of the market. Compared with smaller builders, they have larger and more diverse customer bases, stronger balance sheets and better inventory controls. As a consequence, they build fewer spec homes, they are quicker to adjust the pace of new construction, and they have enough financial strength to cut prices in reaction to inventory upswings. As a result, the inventory cycle may not be as severe as it was in the 1970s and early 1980s. The big builders also have strong balance sheets and ready accessibility to capital from a sound banking system and frisky private equity groups. As a result, the industry will be better positioned to meet the housing needs of Americans when the homebuying climate eventually improves.\n\nBut it is clear from my perch on the economic tree that the housing downturn and the cumulative effect of energy and electricity price increases and higher interest rates, among other factors, are definitely having an impact on the consumer.\n\nTake restaurants, for example, a sector Dallasites know better than most because we have more restaurants per capita than any other city in America. Nationwide, the industry has seen overall “guest counts” decline and has experienced a downward shift in price points, while the costs of utilities and other inputs have soared. This is noteworthy for an industry that employs some 12.5 million workers and feeds 130 million people nationwide every day, and is illustrative of a shift in the tenor of the economy.\n\nThe net effect of the correction in housing and the rise in the costs of transportation and of heating and air-conditioning our homes has been a slowdown in the U.S. economy. After all, it grew at 5.8 percent in the first quarter of this year, a remarkable growth rate for an economy our size. Let me give you some math here. Last year, the gross domestic product of the U.S. economy was about $13 trillion. Had we continued to grow at that annualized rate for the second quarter, we would have produced an additional $377 billion of goods and services in just six months, so large and so strong and so dynamic is the U.S. economy.\n\nFor the past few years, I have referred to the U.S. as a supercharged monster roadster that has trouble keeping its speed of growth within the limits posted by economic doctrine. Recently, the economy has downshifted, and the speedometer on our dashboard has shown a deceleration as it turned the corner from the first quarter to the second. I expect second-quarter GDP growth to be revised upward to closer to 3 percent. And my best guess one month and two weeks into the third quarter is that the speed at which we are now proceeding is roughly of that magnitude. From my vantage point, despite what you hear from some of the Eeyores in the analytical community, a recession is not visible on the horizon.\n\nLet’s not forget, the last economic expansion lasted 10 years. The expansion before that lasted nearly as long. Recessions are becoming less frequent and less severe—in no small part owing to increased global interconnectedness.\n\nWhile the speedometer indicates that the economy is growing—albeit at a slower, more sustainable pace—the problem is that the inflation pressure gauge needle is moving the other way. There is a definite increase in inflationary momentum, though like many in this room, I was delighted to see in this morning’s release a reversal of the recent surge in apparel prices as reported in the headline CPI for July.\n\nAll of the relevant measurements of inflation have shown a pickup in inflation over the first half of the year. This pickup shows up in the measure of price movements in consumer expenditures excluding food and energy, the so-called core PCE. Inflation is also seen in the median CPI calculated by the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank. And we see it in the Trimmed-Mean PCE calculated by our team at the Dallas Fed.\n\nThe differences in these key inflation measures may seem obscure to you, so let me slice this pie another way: When you dissect the components of the PCE, whether trimmed or fully garbed, you find prices increasing in 82 percent of the components measured in June, up from 73 percent in April. That means that at the end of the second quarter, only 18 percent of prices were steady or falling, as opposed to 27 percent two months earlier.\n\nWe also know that economic developments occurring outside the United States are not as readily offsetting domestic price pressures here as they were before. The Dallas Fed has taken it upon itself to better understand how globalization impacts the conduct of U.S. monetary policy. We have only just begun our work on this front, but this much we know: Capacity utilization abroad is rising. This is true in all the member states of the European Union, which are growing their economies at rates not seen in some six years. Recent revisions in the U.K.’s national accounts indicate the Brits are operating closer to capacity. For the first time in over a decade, industry surveys in Japan, the world’s second-largest economy, are reporting capacity constraints.[2] And we all know that China reported second-quarter growth of 11.3 percent, the fastest yet in an already remarkable decade, continuing to press the envelope of what they can produce without bumping into constraints.\n\nAll of which means that as our businesswomen and men search the globe for inputs into the products they produce, the relationship between supply and demand for those inputs is becoming tighter.\n\nYou see a lot of discussion in news columns about the boom in commodity prices. Let me give you another example of how global economic growth is affecting resource utilization. According to one shipping industry leader, a portion of the international fleet of large ships that carries bulk goods across the major oceans—the so-called Panamax-size ships—is being absorbed to service coastal intra-Chinese trade. It may be that only 1 or 2 percent of this fleet has been so reassigned, but it is noteworthy that at a time of year when the daily rates on these ships usually soften, rates have actually risen over the past month and are now roughly two times what they were a year ago. As a result, it costs more for importers to ship goods to the United States for consumption here. This illustrates how global economic growth impacts the prices paid here at home.\n\nTo be sure, the U.S. economy is the world’s biggest. We produce roughly a quarter of the world’s output. So when our economy slows, it takes some steam out of the global engine. Yet in recent years, other economies have been retooled and restructured so as to pull themselves out of the slump they had experienced over the past decade or more—in the case of China, since Mao took power in the 1940s. The changes these countries have engineered have started to pay big dividends in terms of growth. As a result, the U.S. economy is an increasingly smaller part of a larger, more intensely interconnected global economy. Increasing connectedness forces changes in the gearing of our economy.\n\nLet me dwell on this for a minute in the context of our recent FOMC meeting. First, let me assure you that there are no hawks and there are no doves on the committee. I see only owls: 19 men and women who are doing their level best to devise a wise and considered policy aimed at fulfilling the Fed’s dual mandate of providing the monetary conditions that foster sustainable, non-inflationary growth.\n\nThe committee decided in our last meeting that it was timely to pause, in significant part because of the lags in time it takes for the tightening measures the committee had taken over the previous 17 meetings to affect the economy’s inflationary impulses.\n\nThis matter of lagged effects of previous policy initiatives is complex but crucial to your understanding of what we noodle through. Even if the U.S. were an isolated economy, there would be long lags between the time monetary policy is tightened and the slowing of the economy and inflation. And, mind you, the economy traditionally slows before inflation comes down.\n\nFrom my perspective, the dynamics of this important issue of lags is impacted by globalization. Just a few years ago, the global economy was in a slump and the U.S. economy was growing slowly as it emerged from the dot-com bust. Under those conditions, with an abundance of productive resources throughout the world, output here and elsewhere could expand with little or no inflationary pressure. The easy monetary policy conducted by the Federal Reserve between January 2001 and June 2004, and by other central banks worldwide, helped get that expansion going.\n\nA global boom has been under way for the past four years, aided in no small degree by the easy monetary policy that began in 2001. There was a lag before it kicked in, but when it did, it kicked in big-time all over the world. Global GDP has been growing at roughly a 5 percent annual rate, above the 4 percent average recent yearly rate in the U.S. This means that the rest of the world has grown faster than the United States. Excess global capacity has been increasingly absorbed, even as capitalists rush to retool and expand capacity. Inflationary pressures have risen, as evidenced by leaps in commodity prices and the example of shipping prices that I gave you a few minutes ago.\n\nOf late, central banks around the world, including the Fed, have been reining in the accommodation they provided as a spur to global growth. With global growth running stronger than U.S. growth, I would submit that more monetary policy tightening than usual was necessary to slow U.S. growth and inflation because we have been dealing with the lagged effects of the easy monetary policy that spurred the current global growth surge. This is why I supported every one of the increases in the fed funds rate that has been voted on since I joined the Fed over a year ago.\n\nI would also suggest that further globalization will alter the dynamics that govern the lags in our policy initiatives, although I am not yet sure just how they will change. They may become longer, increasing the time it takes for the consequences of Fed tightening measures to take hold.\n\nSimultaneously, I am conscious of the fact that there are other ways globalization changes how markets react to and, in turn, impact monetary policy. So as not to try your patience, let me whip quickly through some of these for the sake of giving you some insight into what vexes central bankers.\n\nNormally, short- and long-term interest rates move in the same direction. When short-term rates rise, so do longer-term rates, and vice versa. This is what analysts refer to when they speak of a positively shaped, or upward sloping, yield curve in a healthy economy. They fret when they see a flat or negatively sloped yield curve because they fear this presages an economic slowdown as investors reach out to lock in the yields on longer maturities. However, recently the globalization of capital markets, combined with a glut of savings outside the U.S., has kept U.S. long-term rates low and steady, despite our healthy economic growth. Short-term rates have risen, but long-term rates have not. The low level of long-term rates makes financial conditions easier than what would be inferred from the movement toward higher short-term rates. This in and of itself may well have lengthened the lags of the impact from tightening monetary policy.\n\nThe point is, the changes we have witnessed in the global economy over the past few years and the phenomenon of globalization matter in that they affect several channels through which both the timing and degree of the impact of monetary policy have been altered.\n\nNow, let me bring this closer to home. Price inflation usually does not become entrenched unless accompanied by wage inflation. Until recently, the productivity of U.S. workers was advancing at the same pace as wages and benefits costs. In the last few months, however, the anecdotal evidence picked up through the Fed’s Beige Book—the survey conducted eight times a year by all 12 Federal Reserve Banks of businesses in their districts—and the anecdotal evidence the Bank presidents and their staffs glean from their conversations with CEOs and other business operators all indicate an emerging and widening shortage of skilled and semiskilled workers, along with attendant upward wage pressures. This has finally begun to show up in the wage, productivity and unit labor cost statistics.\n\nIn addition to studying the numbers and consulting the remarkably comprehensive econometric models of the Federal Reserve staff and other analysts, each of the participants on the FOMC is in regular contact with the people who are in the field hands-on, operating the nation’s businesses.\n\nFor example, I have a habit of regularly consulting the CEOs of 35 or so major U.S. and global companies. This was something taught to me 30 years ago by my mentor, Robert Roosa. He used to say that no chef achieves success only by following the formulae of recipe books; they also have to use their taste buds. The CEOs and other operators of the real economy that we consult are the taste buds in our effort to assist in serving up the right monetary policy. To be sure, one has to be careful with anecdotal evidence, but one thing is very noticeable of late, at least from my consultations. A year ago, the CEOs’ constant refrain was: Competitive forces will not allow me to raise prices. In the past few months, however, more of them are reporting the ability to raise prices, with decreasing customer resistance.\n\nThis phenomenon of real or perceived growing pricing power introduces yet another set of lags into the monetary policy system. Once the perception of having pricing power becomes entrenched, it is difficult to alter. This is a psychological, as well as an economic phenomenon. Behaviors become habits, and habits are hard to change. This is why it is critical for monetary policy to not encourage these emerging pricing behaviors. Keep in mind, it is not just sellers whose pricing behavior is changing; it is customers’ as well.\n\nThis is all by way of saying that we appear indeed to be at something of a crossroads in the economy and in the conduct of monetary policy. The U.S. economy is slowing from its unsustainable, blistering pace of earlier this year. The rest of the global economy is picking up steam, despite our slowdown. We expect that the lagged effects of our actions and those of other central banks to tighten policy will begin to tamp down the inflationary impulses we have witnessed of late. But, frankly, nobody knows with precision how the dynamics of the global economy affect these lags or the practicability of our policies. At least I don’t.\n\nSo, here is the bottom line: In determining future policy, my colleagues and I will watch and listen and “taste” the indicators carefully as they come in. And, as we said at the conclusion of our last FOMC meeting, we will act accordingly. If anybody tells you with absolute conviction that the Fed is done raising interest rates or with equal conviction that they have only paused and will raise rates more starting in September or October, remind yourself that at best—and I’m being generous here—they are only guessing.\n\nI want to conclude by reminding you that the enemy of sustainable growth, and the enemy of every person in this room, the enemy of all the people—the poor, those who are retired or living on fixed incomes, the savers and the rich investors—is inflation. Inflation is the Lex Luthor of the Superman economy that is the United States. It is a sinister force that has the capacity to charm and romance the heck out of you but in the end wreaks only havoc.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will not tolerate inflation. But that doesn’t mean we need to take a sledgehammer to the economy. Going back to Bill Martin’s spoof speech at the Alfalfa Club, I assure you that we have no desire to take a cue from Goethe and conduct a policy that eliminates prosperity. We endeavor to underwrite economic prosperity. And if we see, after this pause, that inflation is beginning to threaten economic prosperity, we will take deliberate and, hopefully, owlish measures to counter it, so that the U.S. economy will continue to prosper.",

            "content": "June 14, 2006 Corpus Christi, Texas\n\nThe Latin root of the word “credit” is credo: I believe. As Jackson Lears wrote in Sunday’s New York Times Magazine: “Faith [is] a necessary component of most transactions in an expanding economy.” I do not know whether faith can move mountains—that is, of course, a matter of faith—but I know well the importance of faith in the great economic machinery that meshes the growing of wheat in West Texas, the making of semiconductors in North Texas, the distilling of petrochemicals on the Gulf Coast and the movement of the ships at sea that call on the nation’s sixth busiest port here in Corpus Christi.\n\nFaith is certainly the basis of your confidence in the Federal Reserve. I have spoken in previous speeches of our “faith-based currency,” a term I use only slightly tongue in cheek. The dollar—like the euro, the yen, the British pound and other currencies—is what economists call a fiat currency. It is backed only by the federal government’s power to raise the revenues needed to meet its obligations and by the rectitude of the U.S. central bank. If the market were to lose faith in either assumption, the dollar would be debased.\n\nIt is not my place to comment on Congress’ business. With the acquiescence of its constituents, including the people in this room, the fiscal authorities have leveraged the U.S. government’s balance sheet by incurring structural liabilities exceeding projected revenues to an unprecedented degree. Economists and public policy analysts have myriad solutions for restoring balance to what they see as a highly leveraged—some would say overleveraged—American ledger. Congress, as keeper of the government’s purse and the sole body with the power to tax and spend the people’s money, has the duty and the means to impose solutions to these imbalances.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has a different duty, performed by different means. We are charged with maintaining the monetary conditions for sustainable, non-inflationary economic growth. This task takes on heightened meaning in an era of highly leveraged government finances, for we must work overtime to sustain the faith.\n\nI am hardly an impartial observer, but I would submit that the Fed has done its job reasonably well. The numbers provide proof: Our $13 trillion economy has been barreling along at remarkable rates of growth for a sustained period without giving rise to inflation.\n\nWe must continue to do our job.\n\nWe know how close we came to creating an economic catastrophe when the Fed took its eye off the ball in the 1970s. And we remember the enmity the Federal Open Market Committee incurred when, under the chairmanship of Paul Volcker, it so dramatically took away the punchbowl of grain alcohol that was fueling reckless economic behavior. We never again want to be placed in the position of either promiscuous accomplice to fiscal impropriety or dour party pooper.\n\nToday, we labor under far more favorable conditions. Economic growth has been strong and prolonged. Employment is at an all-time high. And yet we have resisted monetizing Congress’ spendthrift ways. Money supply growth has thus far been tapered down without jeopardizing economic growth and has restrained inflationary impulses.\n\nBut no Fed official can ever afford to become complacent. The surest way to jeopardize the goodwill earned through the Volcker and Greenspan years would be for the FOMC to brook any behavior that might fan the embers of inflation. We can ill afford to somehow encourage expectations that inflation might gain momentum. For in today’s monetary realm, with markets so fluid and swift, expectations can quickly become reality.\n\nIn the marketplace, the working assumption is that the FOMC has a comfort zone for inflation, one that is quantifiable. According to this assumption, it is precisely quantifiable by a metric known as the Personal Consumption Expenditures deflator, stripped of energy and food prices, or the “PCE, ex-energy and food.”\n\nAt the Dallas Fed, we rely on a different inflation metric, what we call the Trimmed-Mean PCE Deflator. Each month, it sets aside the prices that rose sharply and those that fell a lot, so that temporary inflationary and deflationary developments do not distort our sense of underlying trends. The Trimmed-Mean PCE Deflator captures mainstream inflationary impulses. It ignores the extremes and recognizes that people have to eat, drive and air-condition their homes.\n\nOf late, the Trimmed-Mean PCE Deflator has been running at a rate of 2.4 percent, about 30 basis points higher than the PCE ex-energy and food. A compounding of 2.4 percent over a decade cuts the purchasing power of a dollar to 79 cents. Of course, it is reckless to extrapolate historical numbers. But this 2.4 percent rate is disarmingly close to one of the market’s key indicators of inflationary expectations—the spread between rates paid on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, and ordinary Treasury bonds of 10-year maturity. Another indicator of inflationary expectations is a consumer survey conducted by the University of Michigan. In May, those polled said they expected inflation over the next five to 10 years to run at 3.2 percent a year. One always has to question whether a survey of 500 people, no matter how scientific, actually reflects overall inflationary expectations. Yet again, one turns to the math: Over a decade, 3.2 percent yearly would reduce the value of a dollar to 73 cents. To me, this is more than discomforting. It is unacceptable.\n\nTo perform the duty you expect of me, I need to be relentlessly bird-dogging inflation to prevent a debasement of your dollars. I have done this by supporting each increase of the federal funds rate agreed to by the FOMC since I joined the committee over a year ago.\n\nThis business of getting it right on inflation is by no means an easy task. Econometricians do their utmost to provide us with accurate metrics, such as the Trimmed-Mean PCE Deflator and the PCE ex-energy, ex-food. But we have yet to quantify the unquantifiable: the psychology of the marketplace.\n\nI just attended my 35th college reunion. When I went off to school, my old-fashioned Norwegian mother, worried that Harvard professors in that heyday of radicalism might lead me astray, slipped a quotation into my pocket that read: “Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect: it should not be surrendered to the first comer.” That sums up the Norwegian psyche as well as anything (even if it was borrowed from the decidedly un-Norwegian George Santayana!). Despite the fact that my genetic makeup was leavened by my Australian father’s more ebullient and trusting gene pool, I have carried that original clipping with me all these years, and today, 37 years later, it is taped to my desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\n“Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect” may seem a bit quaint in the age of Paris Hilton and Anna Nicole Smith, but I think it is a useful maxim for those assigned the dull and decidedly unsexy task of conducting monetary policy. We must always suspect the precision of numbers, even as we allow ourselves to be guided by them. And we must be ever watchful for influences that might throw off the accuracy of our econometric compasses.\n\nSo, against that background, how do I see the economy through the circumspect eyes of the Dallas Fed?\n\nAs far back as February, I suggested in a speech in London that first-quarter economic growth would exceed the 4 percent consensus guesstimate then circulating among economists. The latest revision of the GDP number came in at 5.3 percent.\n\nSince March, our Dallas team has been reporting a rotation of the impulses for growth, with business investment in plant and equipment accelerating significantly due to the confidence of corporations in their financial wherewithal and the need for capital expansion to meet projected needs, including continual cost efficiencies. Our economists have viewed this as a partial but not insignificant offset to weakness in the housing market. Despite the rising price of gasoline, our business contacts indicate that consumers continue to buy, but at a lesser clip.\n\nThe bottom line on growth is that we see it beginning to slow from its torrid pace of the first quarter. Let me remind you that we grew at a 5.3 percent annualized rate in those first three months of the year. In our $13 trillion economy, a 5.3 percent growth rate, sustained for a year, would mean incremental growth of $690 billion, an amount equal to the entire output of India or the combined output of Indonesia, Ireland and … my ancestral Norway. If the economy achieves the current Wall Street consensus of 3.5 percent growth for 2006, that would mean increasing GDP by $394 billion, a healthy pace for a gargantuan economy in its fifth year of expansion.\n\nThe numbers I cite are adjusted for inflation. That is, they are “real,” in the sense they are uncontaminated by inflation. The surest way to undermine the real growth rate we foresee from our perch in Dallas would be for inflationary expectations to take hold and begin distorting the spending and investment behavior of consumers and businesses.\n\nAgainst the background of sustained high prices for oil and gasoline and the inevitable propensity of sellers of goods and services to try to pass on cost increases, the brow begins to furrow in contemplating the inflation picture. On the one hand, I know that the Trimmed-Mean PCE Deflator is running at a rate that is just too corrosive to be accepted by a virtuous central banker. But I also know, having been party to it, of the incremental tightenings to which we have been subjecting the base interest rate. And I am fully aware that there is a lag between the time we tighten the valve and the time the impact of that tightening is felt.\n\nMind you, I am not sure we can measure this lag effect with great precision. This is partly due to our imperfect understanding of globalization’s effect on the gearing of our economy—an imperfection we at the Dallas Fed have dedicated ourselves to repairing, if not eliminating. It may also have to do with how markets have discounted the kind of titration* that occurs with the removal of previous monetary stimulus through 16 quarter-percentage-point increases in the federal funds rate, as opposed to less frequent or more dramatic moves.\n\nThis is all by way of saying that conducting monetary policy is as much an art as it is a science. We listen and watch and sniff the sounds and sights and smells of the economy as much as we measure with our advanced, constantly improving but nonetheless imperfect, econometric tool kit.\n\nI am but one voice behind the closed doors of the room where the FOMC deliberates. When called upon by the Chairman for my reading of the economy and my recommendations, I am constantly guided by my mother's advice, especially when it comes to contemplating inflation: I believe it safest to err on the side of skepticism. I cannot speak for my 18 brethren in that room, but I have noticed that each of them harbors a tendency towards Norwegian-like angst. And while this tendency of central bankers may at times be nervous-making for some of you, I believe you would lose faith in us if we conducted our business in any other way.\n\n*I have been eager to use this word ever since high school chemistry. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to finally do so.",

            "content": "May 22, 2006 Dallas, Texas\n\nIt is a pleasure to address the Dallas Assembly. I was a member of the Assembly during the 1980s when I was young enough to qualify for it, and I am delighted to see that it is as spry and active as ever.\n\nI am also delighted to see Stuart Bumpas sitting in the audience—one of Dallas’ most distinguished lawyers—less spry but no less wry. Stuart is uniquely wise. When I was licking my wounds from my midlife crisis—running for the U.S. Senate in 1994—he gave me the perfect restorative: a first edition of P. G. Wodehouse’s The Code of the Woosters. It was the Doubleday Doran first printing of 1938, which I added to the 30-odd works of Wodehouse I had been collecting since my undergraduate days.\n\nMany of you may not be familiar with Wodehouse, the creator of Jeeves and Bertie Wooster, among countless comedic figures. He wrote over 70 novels, some 300 short stories, 18 plays, and, with Jerome Kern and other greats of the musical theater, the book for more than 30 musical comedies. Evelyn Waugh, George Orwell, John le Carré and almost every other writer of his day considered Wodehouse the single best writer of the English language.\n\nI am old-fashioned enough that I still read and reread Wodehouse, in order to keep a whimsical balance to an otherwise too-serious life. And being a money man at heart, I display Code of the Woosters, Stuart’s gift, prominently among my Wodehouse collection. It trades at around $800 in rare book circles. Which effectively means I am the first Texan in history to actually take money off a lawyer.\n\nWodehouse once set out to read all of Shakespeare. “But you know how it is,” he wrote. “Just as you have got Hamlet and Macbeth under your belt, and are preparing to read the stuffing out of Henry the Sixth … something of Agatha Christie’s catches your eye and you weaken.”\n\nToday, you are going to get the hard stuff, not the Agatha Christie or a more modern version or anything else that might be remotely titillating or of immediate gratification. Were I trendy, I suppose I could remind you that in the devout culture of central bankers, every numerary wears the cilice of inflation on his or her intellectual thigh as we pursue our avowed goal of providing the monetary conditions for sustainable non-inflationary economic growth. But there is nothing new or mysterious there. That has always gone with the territory and always will.\n\nWhat is new is the way in which globalization is affecting the gearing of our economy and what an increasingly integrated world means for operating the levers and pulleys of monetary policy. I want to share some personal thoughts on this important subject with you today, for it is what the Dallas Fed research team and I spend a great deal of time grappling with.\n\nI know many of you are eager for some clue about the latest direction of interest rates or some tidbit that might be turned to profit. I will do my best to disappoint you on that front. It was not for nothing that New York Times columnist Bill Safire taunted the Fed a few weeks ago for being coy when those who watch us want a full frontal view. He referred to us as “the House of Hints,” which, being old-fashioned, I consider totally complimentary.\n\nShould I impart any hints at all today, please bear in mind that I am speaking strictly in a personal capacity. I speak neither for my Fed colleagues nor for the other participants in the deliberations of the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nA little over a week ago, I beetled off to Argentina. After meetings and a speech at the Argentine central bank, my wife Nancy and I visited what we believe to be the eighth natural wonder of the world. On the speck of the map where Argentina touches Brazil and Paraguay is a little place called Cataratas del Iguazú. Surrounded by hundreds of miles of rain forest and dense jungle, Mother Nature created there the most beautiful waterfalls imaginable. No town is within miles of this place. And no economic activity invades its pristine scenery, except for ecotourism. So I was astonished when my BlackBerry started buzzing. Harvey Rosenblum, the Dallas Fed’s research director, needed an answer to something or other. There I was, in the middle of a South American jungle, thumbing out an e-mail so work could get done thousands of miles away.\n\nPicture that in your mind’s eye—and kindly ignore the image of my Nancy’s annoyance!\n\nBeing able to work almost anytime from almost anyplace is globalization at work. Technology, capital, labor and ideas, now able to move at unprecedented speed across national boundaries, have integrated the world to an unprecedented degree.\n\nImagine if this had been 10 years ago and I had been manager of a manufacturing operation or a retailer or a service provider that was malfunctioning in my absence. Imagine the painful and slow process that would have been required to ask and answer that question. Operations would have had to shut down for hours or even days as the folks here waited for me to return from vacation or at least reach my hotel, where I could receive a phone call or fax and transmit my decision back to Dallas. My company’s profitability would have been hurt, and the nation’s GDP would have taken a slight hit.\n\nWith BlackBerry in hand in today’s wireless, interconnected world, it made scant difference whether I was in the jungles of Iguazú or here in my office.\n\nIn this and countless other ways, globalization is reconfiguring the economic engine of America. Our citizens and companies do not seek to utilize inputs that are shipped over the surface of the sea or through cyberspace from faraway places for the sheer adventure of it or to brag that their BlackBerry works even in Iguazú. They do it because it makes them better off; because it enhances efficiency. This is the natural process of capitalism as it spreads across the world at brushfire speed, blown hither and yon by the incessant desire of businesswomen and men to drive down costs, make greater profits and grow their enterprises, and in doing so, raise the bottom line for the world economy—a higher GWP.\n\nLet me give you a few numbers that illustrate the breadth and depth of the world’s march toward globalization:\n\nFrom these data alone, it is clear that globalization unleashes competition and accelerates the forces of creative destruction, to borrow the term coined by the great economist Joseph Schumpeter.\n\nIn this turbulent sea of change, there are challenges and opportunities. Business leaders, like many of you here, confront them every day. The men and women who manage America’s businesses—the busy fingers of Adam Smith’s fabled invisible hand—work 24/7 to hone their companies’ productivity and competitiveness. They get it. They understand that America’s workers and businesses prosper by tapping into the opportunities inherent in a hyper-interconnected, integrated world.\n\nI am not sure those of us in the policymaking realm “get it”—at least not yet. Just as globalization has created new dashboards for business operators, it has rewired the lights and switches on policymakers’ control panels. My guess is that the relationship between these lights and switches and the real world of production, prices and jobs is not what it was two decades ago—or a decade ago or even two years ago. It is important that policymakers begin to better understand what is actually going on. Traditional theories and economic models that do not adequately incorporate globalization are likely to result in policy responses that might be too strong or too weak, too soon or too late.\n\nIn the world of central banking, as I said earlier, we are keenly interested in how globalization affects our ability to deliver on our mandate for economic growth with stable prices. We know, of course, that more open economies bring added competition—much of it from places like China and India—that can produce in great volume at lower cost. So we see, for example, that the prices of clothing, electronics, white goods, toys and other heavily traded goods have been held in check. That is the obvious part of globalization—the impact on the availability and prices of traded goods. That is a no-brainer.\n\nLess visible, but no less important, is the incentive foreign competition gives U.S. producers to increase efficiency and remain competitive. We at the Fed talk regularly with hundreds of CEOs, COOs and CFOs, from companies big and small, throughout this vast nation. Almost all of them dwell on the growing internationalization of their businesses and the need for driving productivity up and holding costs down. Under relentless pressure from both consumers and shareholders, they profit by finding the most attractive inputs and processes available anyplace on earth and anywhere within cyberspace.\n\nOne obvious assist to business has come from the fact that globalization has enormously increased labor supply. The math here is pretty simple. In the early ’90s, the disintegration of the stranglehold of the Soviet Union released millions of hungry workers into the system, from little Estonia to bigger countries like Poland. China joined the World Trade Organization at the turn of the century, and over 700 million workers came into play. And now India, with its hundreds of millions of working-age people, has joined the game.\n\nThe U.S. economy has benefited from this surge of new workers. While China gains as an important source of the world’s manufacturing output, its gains have come at the expense of former powerhouses like France and Italy and Japan and other more rigid, less competitive countries. We, on the other hand, have been better able to innovate and adapt and compete. Fear-mongering to the contrary, the United States is not losing ground to this growing Asian giant, despite the long-term shrinking of our manufacturing sector relative to our services sector. It may surprise you to know that, despite the fact that the U.S. remains the world’s largest manufacturer, only 10.5 percent of U.S. jobs are in the manufacturing sector (and only 1.5 percent are in agriculture). We have prospered, and we have driven unemployment down to the lowest level in over four years, by moving up the value-added ladder and becoming the world’s dominant power in creating innovative services.\n\nIncreasing competition in the labor market, I should note, does not come just from vast labor pools making goods and equipment in factories located abroad. It also comes from immigrants, who have contributed more than half of U.S. labor force growth in the past decade. The spread of Information Age technology and the removal of the isolationist yoke of communism and statist regimes create opportunities for virtual immigration as well. In a world wired with fiber-optic cables, foreign workers deliver services from far off—a software program written in Estonia, a call-processing center in Bangalore, or back-office work sent to the Caribbean.\n\nIt would thus appear that one clear consequence of the spread of globalization, the global workforce’s increasing integration into the U.S. economy, has dulled wage pressures here, exerting downward pressure on inflation.\n\nWhat about the impact of imported goods? Analysts who focus only on traditional measures of trade deny globalization’s impact on inflation, noting that imported goods make up a mere 10 percent of U.S. consumption. In nations more integrated with the rest of the world, the import share may rise to 20 percent or 25 percent. The tail never wags the dog, so other countries’ impact on our inflation has to be remote—or so the theory goes.\n\nI beg to differ.\n\nTo be sure, anybody who wanders down the aisle of a Wal-Mart or a Costco or Target store knows that whatever the portion of imported tradable goods, prices of clothing and electronics and almost everything else that you can feel, smell, watch or listen to have become more affordable because of globalization. But the impact is more invasive than that. The distinction between tradables and nontradables is not fixed and absolute. Over time, more and more items become tradable as technological barriers fall and transport costs shrink.\n\nAlan Blinder, a thoughtful economist with a much bigger brain than mine, points out that we can no longer follow the traditional dichotomy between tradables as things that can be put in a container and shipped and nontradables as things that cannot be packed up and sent. “In the future, and to a great extent already in the present,” Blinder writes, “the key distinction for international trade will no longer be between things that can be put in a box and things that cannot. It will, instead, be between services that can be delivered electronically over long distances with little or no degradation of quality, and those that cannot.”\n\nProfessor Blinder teaches economics at Princeton, which shows he has a healthy sense of humor. But he is also a former Fed vice chairman, which tells you he is a serious player. He is well aware that the preponderance of our economic activity and household income derives from services.\n\nEven when you think in terms of labor rather than products, you see a blurring of the concept of what is “tradable.” Real estate, the leisure and hospitality industries, and medical services are generally considered purely domestic, immune from the vagaries of global competition. It is not difficult, however, to detect important global influences in all of them. Who does much of the construction work? Who cleans the rooms and cooks the meals at many of our hotels and resorts? How many doctors and nurses have come to this country from overseas?\n\nThe supplies, and therefore the prices, of many so-called nontradable goods and services are clearly impacted by globalization—at least by my notion of globalization, which includes the cross-border movement of labor and capital as well as goods. You don’t have to live on the border with Mexico to grasp that notion. Just go to a construction site in Chicago or Miami or Seattle and watch and listen. As the great economist Yogi Berra once said, “You can observe a lot just by watching.”\n\nWithout added labor from overseas in all of its forms, U.S. wages would be rising faster. Many might welcome that. After all, Americans would be receiving fatter paychecks. But we would also be facing higher inflation, with all its unpleasant consequences. Without the contribution of the global workforce, moreover, the quantity and variety of goods and services available in the United States would diminish.\n\nI have argued, within the temple of the Fed and without, that globalization has in these and many other ways expanded our concept of “capacity constraints” and redefined our sense of “resource utilization.” It has helped tame inflation. That has been the trend of recent years. But it has not exorcised for once and for all time the demon of inflation.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund recently released its World Economic Outlook, which includes a chapter on globalization and inflation. The report issues a warning that I think bears repeating. “Globalization,” the IMF concludes, “has undoubtedly provided some brake on inflation in the industrial economies in recent years and has allowed for a more measured monetary policy [meaning we have been able to keep interest rates low]…. However, globalization cannot be relied upon to keep a lid on inflationary pressures…. Strong global growth and diminishing [global] economic slack have reduced the restraining impact of declining import prices on inflation.”\n\nEven if you argue, as I do, that globalization’s effect is not limited simply to prices of imported goods and services, one can envision a scenario in which increased resource utilization in other countries might add to inflation rather than mitigate it. We might well be seeing evidence of this as growing demand in emerging economies drives up the prices of oil, copper, zinc and other commodities, even after netting out the speculative excess that has been impacting those markets.\n\nMy point is that even though the playing field has been enlarged and reconfigured by globalization, and even though the world is a far more exciting place, moving at the pace and with the suspense of a modern thriller, there still are some time-tested risks that Federal Reserve officials and other central bankers must fear and manage. We are cursed with still having to “read the stuffing out of” the classic texts, even as some of us seek to improve upon them and adapt them to modern society. The advent of China and India, the introduction of the Internet, new frontiers of science like the Human Genome Project and yes, even the BlackBerry and the iPod and other drivers of greater efficiency, productivity, interconnectivity and economic homogenization, do not overturn the basic premise, for example, that too much money chasing too few goods or productive investments leads to inflation—regardless of whether the sources or placement of those monies are in new places and in new technologies.\n\nThat said, globalization is not going to go away, even if politicians given to the expediency of protectionism or building walls or other costly follies draw up laws that attempt to slow it down. Globalization is here to stay.\n\nGlobalization is not a one-off event; its effects are dynamic and profound. An analogy is the deregulation of U.S. banks and airlines in the late 1970s, both supposedly one-off events. Who would argue that these companies aren’t still adjusting to these one-time shocks? When I helped negotiate China into the World Trade Organization, a process that was not completed until the start of the Bush 43 administration, I knew my yet-to-be-born grandchildren would be dealing with the tail end of the changes wrought by China’s entry into the global marketplace.\n\nI think it is pretty clear that with the emergence of China—and, following in its wake, India, Vietnam and practically everyone else—countries will face heightened competition for valuable factors of production, especially for capital to finance them. Many of these nations, including our own, will have to adjust their fiscal, monetary, legal and regulatory policies if they are to attract capital. We discuss this in the Dallas Fed’s 2005 annual report, which, by the way, reads more like Agatha Christie than Shakespeare, despite its being rooted in fact, not fiction. You might want to go to our web site. Our study finds that the most successful countries in a globalized world place the least burden on the free flow of capital, ideas, people, goods and services.\n\nEven politicians, regardless of party or country, who are genetically wired to thrive on spending O.P.M.—other people’s money—are getting the message. The Financial Times recently reported that Peer Steinbrück, Germany’s finance minister, “pledged to fight back against low taxation in competing European countries, promising a tax system that improved German companies’ global competitiveness.” By way of explanation, Steinbrück said, “An effective tax rate of 39 percent is not internationally competitive.” His words contrast sharply with those of his predecessor, who argued that the Poles, Estonians and other new Europeans should raise their taxes if they want to play nice. Taxes impact costs, and costs impact inflation. Who knows what chain of events a reduction or restructuring in German taxes would set off in Europe and around the world?\n\nThis is what keeps the economists at the Fed on their toes. Economists like to model things. They take the real world, distilling it into equations and graphs to measure how this affects that. The models have enhanced our understanding of the choices consumers, workers, companies, investors and governments make every day. Without them, central bankers would be handicapped in making informed decisions.\n\nEconomic models dealing with global influences have been around for hundreds of years. Modeling evolves along with the economy. The problem is that few models deal with today’s rapidly changing manifestation of globalization. Tremendous complexity is required to capture the sophisticated working and resulting impacts of the changes we are experiencing.\n\nSo far, the models I have seen in the academic literature look at globalization the way a mechanic might look at a vintage Mustang and time how long it takes for it to go from zero to 60 both before and after replacing the rear axle. The problem is, our globalizing economy is not a vintage car. It is more like a 2006 BMW Z4 roadster, fully equipped and Bluetooth enabled. It is a very complex, highly integrated, technologically advanced and brilliantly engineered vehicle that just cannot help exceeding the posted speed limit. Models telling us that changes in the classic Mustang’s rear axle will barely impact its performance are of little use to anyone trying to estimate the top speeds at which a new BMW can handle curves safely. We need to continue devising and refining economic models for a new generation, so we can negotiate the curves on the superhighway that is the modern economy. This is what the research team at the Dallas Fed has been called on to do.\n\nMany of the new realities of globalization are obvious. Unless you have been on another planet, you all know the forces of globalization, now unleashed, continue to remake our world. The challenge lies in understanding what’s going on around us and then harnessing that knowledge so that the U.S. can continue to prosper in a rapidly changing, hypercompetitive world economy. As members of the Dallas Assembly, you have to constantly do this in your businesses, in your law firms and in the many ways you serve this great community. At the Federal Reserve, we must do the same. We will keep you posted on what we learn. And we ask you to return the favor.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "May 20, 2006 University of Texas at Austin\n\nI must sound like an odd duck: a midshipman who became an academic who morphed into a hedge fund manager who became an ambassador and trade negotiator who became a central banker. It all sounds a little serendipitous, if not a little nuts. My daughter Alison once summed me up as the career equivalent of Virginia Woolf’s book To the Lighthouse because, as she put it, “Dad, you have no plot and you never end.”\n\nWell, we are here at the end of an important phase of your lives, the granting of your respective degrees in economics. I hope your interest in this field never really ends. And I hope that having come this far, you understand by this time that yes, indeed there is a plot to economics.\n\nWhen you announced your intended major to your parents, I’m betting they breathed a sigh of relief that you were not choosing medieval French poets as your major. There is much to learn from the medieval period—perhaps more than we can learn from France today. And poetry is, indeed, a refined medium, alone or transformed to song. But few would quarrel with the proposition that there are more job opportunities available today for econ majors. Now that’s a good plot line! Your course of study at this great university has tangible value. “Yes!” say Mom and Dad.\n\nThe meaning of the degree you are going to receive today is, however, far greater than what you might receive for your first paycheck as a consultant or analyst or investment banker or teacher or—if you have the same success I had as a newly minted graduate with an economics degree from Harvard—as a bartender.\n\nEconomics has a unique attribute: It is a liberating course of study. It frees you from ignorance. It gives you powerful tools for reasoning. It provides a logical, consistent and faithful framework that you can apply again and again to think rationally about the world. A good economist is to society what Vince Young is to the game of football—you possess the ability to look down the field, read it and bring order to what anybody else might consider chaos and confusion. Properly applied, it allows you—and the people you instruct in a classroom or lead in the workplace—to score victories against mighty opponents.\n\nWe live in a world undergoing dramatic change. Capitalism and the pursuit of profit—once contested by armed and dangerous opponents in the form of the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China, rejected by then-mortal enemies in Vietnam and ignored by great, but highly bureaucratized states like India—is now embraced by all but a few rogue Latin American and African states. When I was in college, we sent young men to die in a “hot war” in Indochina to protect Asia from communism. We fought a cold war in which we faced mutually assured nuclear destruction from our competitors. Today, we compete for prosperity through markets.\n\nSo different is your world from that I ventured into with my undergraduate degree in economics that today, the debt of Vietnam trades at a yield premium to that of Ford Motor Co. When I graduated from college in 1971, we were still killing the Vietnamese. Much of the Vietnam War had been led by a Secretary of Defense who was the former CEO of Ford. Today, the proceeds of shorting Ford’s stock are invested in the Vietnamese market. And as to our other former Asian protagonist, there isn’t an American business woman or man alive who doesn’t covet access to the wellspring of China.\n\nTalk about taming the animal spirits!\n\nThere is healing power in the weaponry of economics. This is what we know from studying the seminal works of great economists like Adam Smith and David Ricardo and John Maynard Keynes and Joseph Schumpeter and... Langston Hughes and Robert Earl Keen.\n\nAdam Smith, of course, taught us to trust the miracle of the “invisible hand.” If there is one thing we know as Americans, it is that incentivized properly by government and unhindered by the darker impulses of politicians, the men and women who run the private sector—the millions of middle managers and decisionmakers who empower the machine that produces $13 trillion of American output a year and figure out how to grow our economy at rates and for time intervals no one thought possible—act as the nerve endings in the fingers of that invisible hand, reaching into every corner of the globe to extract value, drive productivity and secure our economic future in a globalized world.\n\nDavid Ricardo? Well, he taught us the principle of comparative advantage. We produce most effectively what we produce most competitively. And in doing so, we elevate the standard of living of all our people.\n\nThe legendary British Prime Minister Winston Churchill understood this better than most great leaders. He was a free trader. He spoke of the “superfine processes.” He understood that the cure of protectionism was worse than the disease of competition. Let those who can produce goods cheapest, even with subsidies from their governments, sell those goods unfettered into the British market, he argued. The Brits would take those cheap inputs, add value and turn those inputs into “superfine” products that would command greater prices, generate greater profits and, with those profits, finance greater job creation—just as we do today with imports of goods from China and services from India. We take them in, add to them and move up the value-added ladder to grow our economy by some $410 billion in incremental growth a year—an incremental growth equal to the entire output of Malaysia, Ireland, Chile and Kenya all added together. This is the process that propels California to produce more than China; the process that empowers the 23 million people of Texas to produce 28 percent more output than the 1.1 billion of India; the process that now employs 135 million Americans, having driven the unemployment rate to its lowest level in years.\n\nAnd John Maynard Keynes? Keynes did far more than simply show us what a Republican Congress has learned to practice even better than Democrats: that government spending and deficit accumulation can goose the economy beyond sustainable means. He gave us one of history’s greatest little ditties.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the Bretton Woods conferences were convened to draw up the institutional architecture for rebuilding Europe and making the world safe for capitalism with a World Bank, an International Monetary Fund and a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (which has since evolved into the World Trade Organization). We were the victors in the Second World War, and just as to the victors go the spoils, to the great economists of the United States went control of Bretton Woods. Keynes—who possessed the most fertile mind of the people there assembled but was not an American—complained bitterly to Lord Halifax, the British ambassador at the time, of the Americans’ arrogance, and Halifax sought to comfort him:\n\nWell, it turns out we had both money and brains! For we mastered what Joseph Schumpeter professed from his classrooms at my alma mater after the war: the process of “creative destruction.”\n\nLet me cite three passages from Schumpeter’s great works. Listen carefully, economists.\n\nFirst, he said: “The fundamental impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion comes from the new consumers’ goods, the new methods of production or transportation, the new markets, the new forms of industrial organization that capitalist enterprise creates.”\n\nThen: “The opening up of new markets, foreign or domestic, and the organizational development from the craft shop and factory…illustrate the same process of industrial mutation…that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one. This process of Creative Destruction is the essential fact about capitalism. It is…what every capitalist concern has got to live in.”\n\nAnd then, to hammer home his point, Schumpeter wrote: “A railroad through new country, i.e., country not yet served by railroads, as soon as it gets into working order upsets all conditions of location, all cost calculations, all production functions within its radius of influence; and hardly any ‘ways of doing things’ which have been optimal before remain so afterward.”\n\nString the key operative phrases of those three citations of Schumpeter's together and you get the plot of the story, the plot of the modern, globalized economy we now live in: “The opening up of new markets, foreign or domestic. . . revolutionizes the economic structure, . . . destroying the old one, . . . creating a new one. . . . [It] upsets all conditions of location, all cost calculations, all production functions, . . . and hardly any ways of doing things which have been optimal before remain so afterward.”\n\nThe master of the creative destruction of syntax, Yogi Berra, put it more eloquently: Once you open new markets, “History just ain’t what it used to be.”\n\nToday, China and India, nanotechnology, the Internet and the human genome project, the BlackBerry and the iPod are the railroads of the 21st century that are changing the landscape of history. They are propelling us forward into a world in which whatever was optimal before is no longer so. From now on, history just isn’t what it used to be.\n\nAnd, with all this change swirling around us, you—you who have grounding in economics—have within your tool kit the means to define the newly optimal path to prosperity, to guide us forward in a hypercompetitive, seemingly discombobulated world.\n\nConsider yourselves the trustees of the potential of America. By mastering, by proselytizing and by improving upon the basic teachings of economics—the principles of competition, profit and utility maximization, comparative advantage, creative destruction, survivor theory, rational expectations, time inconsistency, game theory, Ricardian equivalence, public choice theory, growth theory and monetarism—you have in your hands a compass for navigating the treacherous waters of a tumultuous world. It works for me. Just as I am guided in my work today by the essential economics lesson I learned as an undergraduate economics major that too much money chasing too few goods gives rise to inflation, economic “true north” is now within you—your faithful friend and guide through life.\n\nWhat about Hughes and Keen? Where do they fit in? Both are distinctly not medieval or French, and neither is an economist. Yet Langston Hughes reminds us through his eloquent poetry of what motivates all of mankind—American, Chinese, English, Indian, Christian and Jew and Muslim:\n\nAnd:\n\nThe fundamental desire to have access and to have the opportunity to succeed drives all of non-Gaullist woman- and mankind. You can’t run from it. You can’t hide from it. But you, my learned friends, can channel it. This is what economists do! They provide the theoretical and the practical roadmaps for realizing humankind’s dreams.\n\nThat is what I preach today from this pulpit. The disciplines of economics can set you free! Diploma in hand, you are charged with becoming the evangelists of a powerful gospel learned right here, in the Economics Department of the University of Texas. Go out into the world and transform it.\n\nBut let’s get back to the moment. Today, 245 of you are about to receive your bachelor’s degree in economics, one of you will receive your master’s degree, and eight of you have earned the highest of academic accomplishment, your doctorate of philosophy.\n\nHere is where Robert Earl Keen comes into play.\n\nI know he is an Aggie. But he makes good music and is quintessentially Texan. He was spot on when he sang:\n\nLook around you. Those who love you are beaming. Your moms and your dads and your sisters and brothers and lovers and friends and classmates and your professors are the ones who got you here. They sustained you and stood by you. They paid your tuition. They taught you. They comforted you when you were blue. They drank with you when you were down, and they drank with you when you were up. (En vino, or at least, margaritas, veritas!) They pushed you and cajoled you and motivated you to cross the finish line.\n\nThey deserve a little gratitude.\n\nI want you to stand up, turn around and look at this audience of supporters and say:“Thanks. I love you. You are all that matters in the end.”\n\nAnd I want you to hug ’em. Kiss ’em after you get your diploma.\n\nJust do it.\n\nCongratulations, graduates!\n\nAnd, oh, one last pearl of wisdom: “Hook ’em horns.”",

            "content": "April 19, 2006 Buenos Aires\n\nMany of my fellow Federal Reserve Bank presidents are economists by training and trade. I am not. My academic career culminated in an M.B.A. from Stanford, received after undergraduate studies in economics at Harvard and a “vacation” reading Latin American Studies at Oxford.\n\nFor many years, I made my living as an investor, running a hedge-fund and portfolio-management business that specialized in globally diversified equities and distressed debt. After beating the house for 20 years, I figured I was pressing my luck, and I cashed in, walked away from the game and became a U.S. trade negotiator. As a deputy trade representative, I spent a great deal of time negotiating bilateral issues with Argentina’s government. With substantial input from Martin Redrado, I worked with Argentina on plans for the proposed Área de Libre Comercio de las Américas—the ALCA or, in English, the Free Trade Area of the Americas—an effort that, despite our collective best efforts, never got off the ground.\n\nNow, both Martin and I play different roles—we are central bankers. I am delighted to be with him again. I consider him a friend whose company and intellectual insights I value. I thank you, Martin, for inviting me to speak to this distinguished forum today.\n\nI am told that many of you work in the financial industry, as I did many years ago. I feel comfortable sharing my views with people who are out there in the trenches, experiencing every day globalization’s impact on their business opportunities and the gearing of their economies.\n\nI come by my interest in globalization honestly. My father was Australian, my mother a Norwegian born and raised in South Africa. They met in East London (South Africa) and tried to get into the United States in 1939, only to be denied entry. So they had to settle instead in Tijuana, right across the U.S. border in Mexico, and they lived there until they became U.S. citizens in 1947. Almost immediately, my father took a job with a chemical company, which sent him to Shanghai to close down operations as the communist forces were decimating the Nationalist army. My parents returned to the United States shortly before I was born in Los Angeles. Not long afterward, we moved to Mexico City, where I attended primary school and learned the less-than-perfect Spanish I am taking the liberty of inflicting upon you today.\n\nHere is the point of all that personal history: I was “manufactured” in China of components that came from Australia and Norway via South Africa. I was “assembled” in Mexico, and I realized my “value-added” in the United States.\n\nI am a true son of globalization.\n\nLet me remind you of another son of globalization: Sir Edmund James Palmer Norton. Sir Edmund was born on the frontier between Denmark and Germany to English parents. After earning an engineering degree in the U.K., he landed a job building a railroad across the Andes from Argentina to Chile. In the process, he visited Mendoza, where he realized the region’s potential for wine production. In 1895, he founded a winery in Perdriel, later importing vines from France.\n\nAnd so, Argentina’s wine industry was born. Norton established one of the country’s great legacies. Thanks to that industry, a whole region of the country has prospered, belying the claims of those who say globalization impoverishes people and reduces living standards. The wine industry provides thousands of jobs for workers with all levels of education and skills—from the croppers who pick the grapes by hand, to the agricultural engineers who monitor the soils, to the oenologists who supervise the winemaking process. In addition, there is the indirect economic activity from wine country tourism, as well as business in financing vineyard operations and distributing wine here and overseas.\n\nToday, Argentine wines are highly competitive in the global marketplace. Wine lovers the world over have benefited from the availability of Argentine cabernets and merlots on the shelves beside French, Italian, Chilean and California brands. We U.S. consumers are seeing more and more Argentine wines in our stores, and we do enjoy them. And I should add—in vino veritas!—that I personally enjoy them very much. I will refrain from any meddlesome comments about Argentina’s trade policies as they affect agricultural exports, with one exception: As a connoisseur of wines—please, never ban Malbec exports!\n\nNew Ways of Thinking\nLet me get serious now. What do I mean by globalization? There are many convoluted definitions of the term. Mine is simple: In the world we now live in, economic potential is no longer defined or confined by political or geographic boundaries. A globalized world is one where goods, services, money, workers and ideas migrate to wherever they can work together most efficiently, flexibly, securely and profitably.\n\nBecause of my far-ranging origins, I have been drawn to the idea of globalization as a birthright. My experience at the Fed has, if anything, increased my interest in it. I am convinced that central bankers everywhere need to better understand the forces behind globalization as they pursue monetary policies that lay the foundation for sustainable, non-inflationary growth in employment and output. This afternoon, I want to expand on this. I will do so in my personal capacity and, as always, speak today for neither my colleagues at the Federal Reserve nor the other members of the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nMost of you probably remember the Tequila Crisis. In early 1995, shock waves from a financial earthquake in another hemisphere traveled silently through the Panama Canal and across the Amazon, then exploded over the Pampas. And it all occurred because of the collapse of the market for short-term Mexican government debt, the infamous tesobonos. A small lapse thousands of miles away was enough to trigger a panic that almost brought to its knees the dollar-standard regime that had put an end to decades of chronic high inflation in Argentina.\n\nGiven this background, as well as other cases of relatively small economies being buffeted by external developments, it is only natural for central bankers here and elsewhere to approach their monetary policy decisions with an eye on developments elsewhere in the world. Domestic monetary policies can sometimes be less important than the effects of the policies adopted by the United States, Europe, Japan and other large economies.\n\nMaybe that is why Latin American central bankers seem in some ways ahead of the rest of the world in realizing globalization’s impact on monetary policy. Most of you already know we can no longer assume economic or financial developments in remote parts of the world—new technologies or suppliers in some cases, financial market disruptions in others—will leave our economies unscathed.\n\nThis is second nature to you. So you may find it surprising that in preparing for my job at the Dallas Fed, I discovered that U.S. central bankers have not always had the same level of awareness about globalization’s importance for monetary policy.\n\nOne of the books I read during my self-imparted training for this job was A Term at the Fed, an excellent, first-hand account by former Fed Governor Larry Meyer. The book gives a good sense of the lexicon of monetary policy deliberations. The language of Fedspeak is full of sacrosanct terms—such as “output gap” and “capacity constraints” and “the natural rate of unemployment,” known by its successor acronym, NAIRU, the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment.\n\nAll this jargon reflects the fact that central bankers do not wish to strain the economy’s capacity to produce. They want GDP to run at no more than its theoretical speed limit because going too fast for too long might stoke the fires of inflation. One key factor influencing the economy’s capacity, for example, is the size of the labor pool. The shibboleth known as the Phillips curve posits that increasing employment beyond a certain level will ignite demands for greater pay, with eventual inflationary consequences for the entire economy.\n\nThe econometric calculations behind the Phillips curve, capacity constraints and output gaps were based on assumptions of a world that, in my opinion, no longer exists. It is my understanding that conventional economic concepts are also being challenged in these latitudes. Here in Argentina, the jargon is different. It is replete with such terms as “currency substitution,” “fear of floating,” “sudden stops” and “flight to quality.” They conjure up images of a policymaking process conducted amidst the tectonic forces of globalization.\n\nI am almost certain that was the intention of the superb Latin American theorists who pioneered the use of these terms, among them the great Argentine economist Guillermo Calvo. True, I sometimes find references to the Phillips curve in Latin America’s monetary policy discussions, but not with the frequency and emphasis I encounter in the United States.\n\nPerhaps economic adversity explains why Phillips curves, output gaps and other such concepts do not enjoy the same popularity in this region as they do in the U.S. Latin America’s inflation was rampant in the 1980s. During that so-called “lost decade,” many countries experienced chronic but seemingly benign annual inflation rates of 15 percent—if you can call a doubling of the price level in five years benign. Then, almost overnight, inflations turned into hyperinflations. My conjecture is that the dramatic social consequences of those episodes gave policymakers and economists much stronger incentives to understand why their economies did not realize the employment gains the Phillips curve suggests should come with higher inflation.\n\nIn the search for answers, Latin American central bankers may have been persuaded early on by the powerful arguments Robert Lucas offered in a 1972 paper that would earn him the Nobel Prize a little over two decades later. According to Lucas, central bankers could not exploit the Phillips curve’s inflation–output trade-off simply because such a relationship was intrinsically nonexploitable. The negative correlation between the inflation and unemployment rates captured in the Phillips curve is a mirage. It is there, you can see it in the data, but you cannot “touch it,” so to speak. Attempts to “touch it” will result in stinging frustration: A higher inflation will produce just that, a higher inflation, without any effects on economic activity or employment.\n\nPerhaps globalization had a role in pushing Latin American central bankers to accept Lucas’ critique. Every time they had tried to take advantage of the Phillips curve, pushing inflation a little higher to pump up output, the resulting capital outflows sent their economies into recession, reduced tax revenues and forced them to pay the bills by printing money. Making monetary policy decisions with the elusive Phillips curve in mind had led to pushing the wrong buttons. Once Latin America’s central bankers ceased to trust the Phillips curve, inflation rates plummeted. Argentina, for example, could point with pride to one of the world’s lowest inflation rates by the 1990s.\n\nEven in the latter part of the ’90s, the lessons Latin America’s central bankers had learned the hard way had not penetrated the United States. As a result, we almost ended up pushing the wrong buttons. Since this audience may be unfamiliar with U.S. policy debates of the 1990s, let me give you a brief account of what went on.\n\nIn the second half of the decade, U.S. economic growth was strong and accelerating. Unemployment was low, approaching rates unseen since the 1960s. In these circumstances, inflation was supposed to rise—if you believed in the Phillips curve and prevailing views of output gaps, capacity constraints and the NAIRU. That is what the Fed staff’s models were saying. In his book, Governor Meyer tells how he and nearly all the other Fed governors and presidents around the FOMC table concluded that monetary policy should be tightened to head off the inevitable price increases. They were frustrated by Chairman Greenspan’s insistence on postponing rate hikes, yet perplexed that inflation wasn’t rising. Indeed, it kept falling.\n\nIf the conventional wisdom had prevailed, the Fed would have pushed the wrong buttons and slowed the economy. According to some back-of-the-envelope calculations by economists I respect, real GDP would have been lower by several hundred billion dollars. Employment gains would have been reduced by perhaps a million jobs. The costs of not being right on the critical calibrations of monetary policy would have been huge.\n\nHow was Greenspan able to get it right when other very smart men and women did not? Well, we now see with 20/20 hindsight what Greenspan instinctively saw early on—that accelerating productivity had begun to alter the traditional relationships among economic variables. Greenspan is a great listener and very perceptive. He had been hearing from business leaders that the revolution in information technology had allowed their companies to reap rapid gains in output and cut costs. He understood what that meant for the economy as a whole.\n\nIn the realm of macroeconomic theory, ideas that supported Greenspan’s policy stance were already taking shape. A leader in these intellectual developments was one of the great minds of the economics profession, who, I can claim with pride, has been a Dallas Fed consultant for more than a decade. I’m talking about 2004 Nobel laureate Finn Kydland. He and co-winner and co-author Edward Prescott, an economist affiliated with the Minneapolis Fed, had determined as early as 1982 that supply-side shocks like those hitting the United States in the 1990s were the most important factor in post–World War II business cycles.\n\nAccording to Kydland and Prescott, productivity gains, a frequent source of supply-side shocks, had accounted for as much as two-thirds of the U.S. economy’s fluctuation after 1945. They concluded that, at least for the United States in recent decades, fluctuations in the price level have been countercyclical. Put differently, changes in the price level tend to be below trend when economic activity is above trend. In 1997, by the way, Kydland and our own Dallas Fed economist Carlos Zarazaga found that the price level in Argentina exhibits the same countercyclical pattern Kydland and Prescott uncovered for the United States.\n\nLooking at the graphs and equations of the Kydland and Prescott model is not exactly like contemplating Velázquez’s Las Meninas, but it nonetheless has the same revolutionary significance. Kydland and Prescott rocked the profession. When it comes to monetary policy, their findings had far-reaching implications. Their work led to policy prescriptions that ran contrary to the prevailing wisdom: In the presence of a productivity surge, the Fed should not tighten but should instead let the economy enjoy the ride without fearing a rise in inflationary pressures. That is the exact opposite of the recommendation suggested by the traditional views described in Meyer’s book. But it is right in line with the conclusions Greenspan arrived at in a more intuitive fashion.\n\nBefore moving on, I want to review the timeline. Kydland and Prescott’s initial path-breaking paper, titled “Time to Build and Aggregate Fluctuations,” was published in 1982. More than a decade later, Meyer tells us, U.S. policymakers’ primary frame of reference was still the same Phillips-curve, output-gap paradigm that Kydland and Prescott had shown inadequate for high-productivity-growth periods like the late 1990s.\n\nWhy such a mismatch between theoretical insights and central bank practices? I cannot answer that question with any authority, but I want to make an observation. There seems to be a long lag between the time a new paradigm emerges and when policymakers effectively use it to guide their decisions. This only increases my sense of urgency about the need to deepen our understanding of globalization’s impact on monetary policy. Countries around the world, including this one, are feeling the effects of the productivity surge occurring in China and India—a direct consequence, by the way, of the market-friendly reforms those countries are implementing in a deliberate effort to become full members of the globalization club. We need to comprehend how the world works because knowledge gives us a better chance of pushing the right buttons.\n\nThinking about Globalization\nThe experiences of Latin America, Chairman Greenspan’s intuitive wisdom and the empirical work of Kydland and Prescott all point toward the same conclusion: The old economic tool kit can no longer do the job. We need new tools—a rejiggering, if you will—of our econometric equations for a globalizing economy.\n\nThe forces of globalization can produce productivity shocks, rippling through economies in ways similar to the U.S. technology-driven shocks of the 1990s. Productivity increases abroad reduce the cost of consumer goods and imported inputs at home, helping hold down domestic inflation.\n\nI do not see how flexible exchange rates can sever the connection between foreign productivity shocks and the domestic cost of living, although that is what traditional economic theory teaches. If domestic prices are “sticky” for any reason, the economy may react to developments abroad in different ways under flexible and fixed exchange rates. But merely acknowledging a “reaction” suggests policymakers need to know how to recognize the impacts and adjust for them. Productivity improvements in China, for example, might prompt a different reaction from the monetary authority, depending on whether Chinese products represent 1 percent, 10 percent or 50 percent of the consumers’ market basket.\n\nAt this point, the debate becomes quantitative: What we central bankers must do to maintain price stability may depend on parameters that determine how local goods substitute for imports or on the nontradable proportion of the typical consumer’s basket. Perhaps those who question globalization’s importance are suggesting that the current values of such globalization parameters are too small to play an important role in setting monetary policy. According to that view, for all practical purposes, U.S. monetary policy should be set as if the rest of the world didn’t exist.\n\nWe all know, for example, that nontradable goods account for a sizable fraction of U.S. consumer price indexes. Take housing, which can represent a quarter to two-fifths of a typical household’s budget. Because houses and the land they sit on are nontradable, a decline in Chinese housing costs has no impact whatsoever on U.S. price indexes.\n\nI do not find this argument compelling. To me, tradable goods are not limited to what can be boxed up and put on a container ship or sent abroad over the Internet. I would expand the definition to any good whose price is subject to arbitrage. I do not think it is farfetched to argue that if Paris housing prices get too high, people will relocate to other cities, like Rome or Madrid. Or even beautiful Buenos Aires. Of course, we need to discuss parameter values, such as the desirability of Buenos Aires relative to Paris at various housing price differentials. But the point remains: It is hard to think of goods that are completely nontradable under the arbitrage criteria.\n\nEven productivity gains in foreign nontradables can have an impact on monetary policy at home. Let me suggest a plausible transmission channel. A recent study by Emek Basker of the University of Missouri estimates that prices for a wide range of goods—toothpaste, shampoo, aspirin, laundry detergent and the like—fall 7 to 13 percent five years after Wal-Mart arrives in a city. So assume a Wal-Martization of China, which would confer on Chinese consumers the benefits of supposedly nontradable retail services. As a result of Wal-Mart’s lower prices, however, real wages in China would go up, and with them demand for U.S. products. This is a scenario that might call for monetary policy response, depending again on the yet unknown values of certain globalization parameters.\n\nHow important is this aspect of the “Wal-Mart effect”? Perhaps small, perhaps large. We do not know—and that is the problem. In the spirit of exposing the sin but not the sinner, let me remind you that in the 1990s, well-respected economists published papers in top professional journals arguing that productivity shocks were not important during that decade. Now, those same scholars are busy cranking out papers to tell us that … well ... productivity did matter after all.\n\nI learned from Greenspan that it is important to follow one’s instincts, guided in my case by my own experience and almost daily personal contact with market participants (and comforted by the knowledge that I am surrounded by level-headed, thoughtful colleagues at the Federal Reserve). I guess that is in the nature of things. Each of us has the responsibility to report the enemy’s position as we see it from our vantage point on the battlefield. Scholars may need to be skeptical of the claim that globalization is becoming more important for monetary policy. From my position as a central banker, using insights gathered before I arrived at the post, I have a responsibility to communicate the opposite. My business contacts talk and act as if the globalization now under way will bring another decade of intense competition. This hothouse will enable—perhaps even force—businesses to keep productivity growth in the range we have enjoyed since the mid-1990s—hopefully, for many years to come. If labor productivity growth can stay near 3 percent, monetary policy can accommodate relatively faster growth without igniting inflation.\n\nI understand the formidable theoretical and empirical challenges of establishing a connection between globalization, productivity and inflation. It could take us a long time to establish such relationships with some confidence, although I pray it will not take as long as the 300 years it took to prove Fermat’s last mathematical theorem! I am hopeful that in reasonable time, the brilliant economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and others in the economics profession—men and women who are true economists and not just M.B.A.’s like me—will provide us with useful guidelines for how globalization impacts policy decisions.\n\nIn closing, let me remind everybody here that regardless of your views on globalization, keeping inflation in check is a central bank’s sacred mission. By spurring productivity and fomenting tectonic economic change, globalization has thus far acted as a tailwind for the Fed’s—and other central banks’—efforts to hold down inflation. I believe the Fed has been able to contain inflation with faster growth than would have been possible in the absence of globalization. The secular impact of enormous new capacity and factor inputs from China, India and the other new economic entrants—transmitted through globalization—has offset the price pressures on commodities and other goods that have been spurred by growing demand in those countries, as well as normal cyclical price developments.\n\nWill the tailwinds stay with us?\n\nLeft to their own devices, I think they would remain for a significant time. But the political dimension cannot be discounted. I have been and will remain outspoken about the dangers of protectionism in the United States. Protectionism is nothing but a tax on the consumer and the businesses that use foreign inputs. Every protectionist impulse, however politically advantageous for a particular political jurisdiction or an individual industry, undercuts globalization’s favorable impact on inflation. Protectionism could lead to interest rates higher than otherwise required to maintain low inflation.\n\nHaving voiced my antipathy for protectionism and interference with the positive impact of globalization on the price mechanism through political expediency, I should point out to this distinguished audience that the Congress and the executive branch of the United States have respected the Federal Reserve’s independence. All of us, on the central bank side of the equation and the political side, have vivid memories of the dangers of diverting monetary policy from its goal of conducting itself so as to achieve sustainable non-inflationary growth in employment and output—even under conditions of extreme political crisis.\n\nAs a Texan, I am mindful of the story about William McChesney Martin, Fed chairman from 1951 to 1970. President Lyndon B. Johnson invited him down to his Texas ranch for what turned out to be a one-on-one meeting. The president wanted a more accommodating monetary policy, and Martin, a strong advocate of Fed independence, tried to explain to him the consequences of that course of action. Johnson would have none of it and advanced on Martin, shoving him around the room and shouting, “Boys dying in Vietnam, and Bill Martin doesn’t care!” Years later, Martin, who had until that moment been an exemplary central banker, expressed his regrets about shifting policy to suit the president. “To my everlasting shame,” he said, “I finally gave in to him.”\n\nPresidents Clinton and Bush have allowed the Fed to operate with a high degree of independence. On the whole, the U.S. Congress has also wisely refrained from interference. Without its independence from political interference, I doubt the Fed could have so successfully set the interest rates that have led to today’s strong U.S. economy. Just as I doubt that, without independence from the rigid econometric dicta of well-intentioned but outdated experts, monetary policy could have so adroitly harnessed, and in turn lubricated, the forces of globalization.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "April 11, 2006 Dallas, Texas\n\nThe thought of speaking to such an august assembly in April was difficult enough. Then you invited me to address the Friday Group on … a Tuesday. You know, this could get downright confusing. I am happy to see so many of you managed to show up on the right day. One of the great pleasures of speaking in Dallas is seeing so many familiar and friendly faces.\n\nI was a member of this group when it was less august and when we always met on Fridays. I remember one particular session some 20-odd years ago, when Ted Strauss introduced his brother Bob. They were vintage performances by both Strausses: Ted gave an intro that was longer than Bob’s speech and, being an erudite fellow, was all over the map. In fact, Ted’s introduction was so long that Ambassador Strauss said, “I hadn’t realized Ted was going to provide a (expletive deleted) travelogue, so in the few seconds remaining, I better just get to the point and tell you what I came here to say.”\n\nGray Mayes has provided a nice introduction, yet kindly kept it short. But I still think I’ll keep to Bob Strauss’ form and just get down to what I came here to say. I will speak, as always, only for myself and not for any other senior official at the Fed or for my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nWe cannot fully understand the U.S. economy without appreciating how it interacts with the rest of the world. We live in an era of globalization, and policymakers in both the political and monetary realms must come to grips with this if we are to fulfill our mandates and do what is expected of us.\n\nGlobalizing economies are increasingly open to movements of goods, services, capital, people and ideas across borders. Citizens and companies do not seek to do business in far-away places for the sheer adventure of it. They do it because it makes them better off. This is the natural process of capitalism, constrained by the cost of transport and information and accelerated by technologies that make it cheaper to move goods, services and ideas. Globalization will proceed apace unless or until the governmental authorities intervene to stop it.\n\nA few numbers tell the story of the world’s march toward globalization:\n\nGlobalization generates controversy. It unleashes competition and accelerates the forces of creative destruction, to borrow the term coined by economist Joseph Schumpeter. In this turbulent sea of change, there are challenges and opportunities. Business leaders confront them every day. The men and women who manage America’s businesses—the busy fingers of Adam Smith’s fabled invisible hand—work 24/7 to hone their companies’ productivity and competitiveness. They get it: They understand that America’s workers and businesses cannot prosper by shrinking from the demands of globalization or hiding behind protectionist barriers.\n\nMany analysts highlight the benefits of globalization to the private sector—not only the strength that competition builds but also the gains from trade, specialization and productivity that come with expanding markets. This is so widely written about now that it is almost old hat. I did not come to speak to you today about this dimension of globalization. You already know it because you practice it. Instead, I thought I would speak to you today about globalization and the public sector.\n\nToday, the Dallas Fed is issuing its 2005 annual report. It includes some data that will give you a good fix on some of what we do. In addition to supervising and regulating banks, we processed almost a billion checks worth $900 billion last year and paid out and received 5.4 billion in circulating notes worth $92 billion. Money is the economy’s lifeblood. Federal Reserve Banks are critical to maintaining the payments system and keeping the capillaries, veins and arteries of the economy’s cardiovascular system operating efficiently.\n\nI want to draw your attention to a punchy essay in the annual report that analyzes the interplay of globalization and public policy. Its title gives away our conclusion: Racing to the Top: How Global Competition Disciplines Public Policy. In short, we found strong correlation between increasing globalization and measures that promote faster growth, lower inflation, higher incomes and greater economic freedom.\n\nThe economic logic is straightforward. Competition brings benefits to the public sector the same way it does the private sector. Because factors of production are increasingly mobile in an era of globalization, governments vie to gain and hold onto them. Mobile factors will flee economies that burden them with high taxes, excessive regulation and capricious administration. They gravitate toward countries that offer the best opportunities to increase profits or paychecks. The economic benefits of productive factors give nations strong incentives to maintain or adopt better economic policies.\n\nOur study uses the globalization index devised by A.T. Kearney and Foreign Policy magazine, which ranks roughly 60 countries from the most to least globalized. It includes cross-border trade and investment as well as measures for technologies that shrink the world, people-to-people connections and government participation in the global community. The United States is the fourth most globalized country in the world, behind Singapore, Switzerland and Ireland. Iran comes in last.\n\nWe looked at how the countries in the A.T. Kearney/Foreign Policy index fared on 18 measures of public policy, all from such well-respected sources as the World Bank, the Fraser Institute of Canada, the Heritage Foundation, Harvard University and Transparency International. The mashing of all these numbers yielded some interesting results that shed light on the debate about globalization.\n\nOverall, we found a strong correlation between globalization and better policies. As nations become more globalized, they tend to be more open to international trade, maintaining lower tariffs and reducing other barriers. They are more open to foreign capital, allowing foreigners to participate in their economies as direct and portfolio investors. Increasing globalization is associated with fewer and better-administered regulations, a more favorable corporate tax environment and policies that stimulate innovation.\n\nIn countries with a higher degree of globalization, you also find policies supporting more accountability in the private and public sectors. These nations are more likely to maintain courts that recognize property rights and enforce the rule of law. Their governments are more effective and less corrupt. Policies in these more globalized countries tend to be more stable, an important consideration for the long-term planning needed for business.\n\nAs a central banker, I am particularly interested in our study’s implications for monetary policy. Inflation is the central banker’s nemesis—the Lex Luthor of the monetary realm. It robs money of its purchasing power. It cripples the poor and destroys the purchasing power of the elderly and others who live on fixed incomes. It erodes incentives to work and save. And it debases investment. Let inflation get out of control, and in no time, a dollar invested becomes a quarter earned.\n\nToday, money is probably the most mobile factor of production. In a nanosecond, it can scurry to any part of the world with just a squeak of a computer mouse. Nations that fail to control inflation will find they cannot retain their own capital or attract money from other countries, except at high interest rates. They end up not only with high inflation but also with lower investment, higher interest rates and slower growth.\n\nMost countries want to avoid these outcomes. They want to retain capital and attract it from other countries. Low inflation helps them do so. Over the past 30 years, there has been a marked decline in inflation across the world—particularly among the nations most integrated into the world economy. We found that inflation descended in stair-step fashion in the period from 2001 to 2003. It averaged 10 percent among the least globalized quarter of nations in our study, then fell to 6.2 percent for the next quartile of globalized nations, 3.1 percent for the third quartile and 2.3 percent among the most globalized quartile.\n\nNot every government policy has improved with globalization. For example, our study found no evidence of increasing globalization and fiscal restraint. Governments tend to get bigger as nations become more interconnected to the world economy. Public transfers and subsidies increasingly pervade nations as they globalize, and personal income taxes become more burdensome as well. Why does fiscal policy respond little to globalization? We do not have a definite answer, but perhaps it is because these nations are richer and have the means to spread those riches through their societies.\n\nGovernment labor policies also seem sticky, if not quite immune, when it comes to dealing with the forces of international competition. Except for the top quarter of globalized nations, labor market flexibility does not generally improve as economies open up to the rest of the world. As long as workers refuse to acknowledge they are competing in a global economy, they will petition wealthy governments to protect their jobs. Labor market rigidities slow job growth and raise unemployment, in turn creating a greater demand for expensive and expansive safety nets for idle workers.\n\nThe recent demonstrations in France show the political difficulty of enacting even relatively modest changes in regulations that hamstring hiring and firing, raise costs and increase unemployment. Yesterday, the French government yielded to those protests, withdrawing the proposed reforms. Perhaps it is an overly optimistic view, but I am encouraged that the French government recognized that restoring competitiveness requires loosening of the country’s labor laws. And not all French youths were protesting the proposed new law. Some of them were in other countries—at jobs that are not available in France. Boris Mollereau, just 27 years old and a business school graduate, moved to London to find work, making him a mobile factor, if ever there was one. Listen to what he had to say in this morning’s Financial Times: “Here, I might lose my job more easily, but I can find another job just as easily. French people don’t realize that a robust job market is in itself a form of job protection.”\n\nCould it be said any better?\n\nOther countries, including Germany, have also come to realize the importance of nimble labor markets in today’s ever more connected world. They are beginning to enact reforms. You cannot stop firms from seeking the best workers for the money, wherever they may be found, especially as advances in telecommunications and transportation and inventory and supply chain management bring the world closer together. Labor’s best option in a globalized world is to adapt, compete and get stronger.\n\nWith the important exceptions of fiscal and labor policies, our study concludes that globalization is associated with better policies. Of course, there is a chicken-and-egg problem in discerning whether globalization improves public policy or whether nations that improve their policies succeed in becoming more globalized. It is probably both. We should celebrate, not denigrate, globalization. In general, it is associated with better government policies, ones that lead to higher living standards and greater economic freedom.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "April 5, 2006 La Jolla, California\n\nEstimados amigos, gracias por la oportunidad de hablarles sobre la economía del país donde pasé mi juventud—un país que ocupa un lugar especial en mi corazón. Cuando mis padres llegaron de Sudáfrica en 1939, las autoridades de los Estados Unidos no los dejaron entrar. Entonces, ellos se fueron a México. Vivieron ocho años en Tijuana, cruzando la frontera varias veces a pie, hasta que se hicieron ciudadanos de los Estados Unidos en 1947. Es por eso que con mucho orgullo nos hacemos llamar “gringos mojados.”\n\nYo nací en Los Angeles en 1949. Después de mi nacimiento, fuimos a vivir a la ciudad de México. Tuve el privilegio de cursar la escuela primaria en el Distrito Federal. Fueron años preciosos e inolvidables.\n\nPorfirio Díaz mencionó alguna vez: “Pobre México: tan lejos de Dios y tan cerca de los Estados Unidos.” Poor Mexico: so far from God and so close to the United States.\n\nI don’t think this is at all true. Mexico is, of course, joined at the hip with the United States—and Texas and California, too, for that matter—and it is a good thing for all of us. As for being distant from God, though, I doubt it. Let me share a story my father told me upon our return to the United States. I had been put back a year in school because my English was not up to par.\n\nMy father’s story imagined a conference of the great leaders of various religious denominations. It included the evangelical preachers, the archbishops of the Catholic Church, the most respected rabbis and the few imams you could find at the time. Never before had there been such an assemblage of spiritual leaders.\n\nInto their midst wandered a small child, an innocent, who asked the religious men a question of great theological import: “Who is special in the eyes of the Lord? Is it the little children? Is it the Israelites? The people who wander the great deserts? The poor and the downtrodden? Who is it, really?”\n\n“Well, little girl,” the clerics responded, “you know the Lord plays no favorites. He loves all. But don’t take our word for it. We will ask Him. Come, let us pray and ask the Lord to send us a sign as to whom He smiles upon.”\n\nThey got on their knees. They bowed their heads. And the great men reverently asked the Lord to send the child a signal—“Just a sign, dear Lord, a simple expression, as to who among the peoples of the world you especially favor.”\n\nAt first there was no answer.\n\nAnd then a bolt of lightning parted the skies. The sun shone brightly. And a booming voice came down from the heavens: “Bu-e-nos dias….”\n\nThis evening, I am going to give you a straightforward brief on Mexico’s economic progress and predicament as I see them. Lo voy a hacer principalmente en ingles ya que tenemos miembros de la prensa que no hablan español. My perspective is forged in part by the four years I spent negotiating trade and market liberalization with Mexico. The views I am going to express are just that: my personal expression, backed by the research of our able economists of the Eleventh Federal Reserve District. These views are not those of any other Federal Open Market Committee members or Federal Reserve officials.\n\nI want to cover monetary policy—no surprise there. After that, I will take up Mexico’s financial situation as we approach the end of the current sexenio and this summer’s elections. Stepping back for a longer-term view, I will then discuss some challenges to Mexico’s economic prosperity. If I pass over anything too quickly or leave anything out, we might take it up in the question and answer period.\n\nI start with monetary policy because it is my firm belief that economies cannot achieve sustainable growth without monetary discipline. Furthermore, I believe that monetary discipline cannot be sustained without an independent central bank. We live in a globalized world. Capital, labor and ideas are freer than ever to migrate to places where they will earn the best return. A country that debases the returns to those inputs cannot expect to retain them and harness them to work on behalf of its people.\n\nPresident Zedillo and his successors in the Fox administration understood well the need to bolster Mexico’s competitiveness. Safeguarding Mexico’s economic health is also manifest in the superb leadership exhibited by Guillermo Ortíz at Banco de México and Francisco Gil Díaz at Hacienda. Together, they have been the Batman and Robin of Mexico, as good a combination of central banker and finance minister as has been seen in the Americas since the tandem of Alan Greenspan and Bob Rubin.\n\nA critical ingredient in Mexico’s monetary policy success has been the establishment of a fully independent central bank that makes controlling inflation its main goal. Central bank independence is protected by Article 28 of the constitution, which was amended in 1994 to read:\n\nThese are magic words. With a clearly stated goal and constitutional protection, Banco de México under Governor Ortíz has become a no-nonsense practitioner of inflation targeting. As a result, Mexico now boasts its lowest inflation in 30 years, with consumer prices rising at around 3 percent a year.\n\nThis is a monumental accomplishment. Inflation is an onerous tax and a disincentive to work, save and invest. In an economy plagued by rising prices, a dollar saved ends up a quarter earned, a fact that does not change if you deal in pesos and centavos. Some cynics worry that a new Mexican administration might decide to interfere with the central bank’s independence. It would prove very difficult to do so. Modifying Article 28 to reduce Banco de México’s independence would require going through the amendment process defined in Article 135. This would entail (1) the agreement of two-thirds of Congress and (2) the approval of a majority of the state legislatures. Given Mexico’s divided polity, this is highly unlikely.\n\nWith sound management reinforcing the constitutional guarantee of central bank independence, the markets have displayed unprecedented confidence in Mexico. Here is where the treasury comes into the picture. Hacienda has accumulated enough foreign reserves to cover all its overseas obligations over the next two years, which provides strong insurance against the sort of capital outflow Mexico experienced more than a decade ago during the Tequila Crisis.\n\nThis insurance strategy is just a small part of 10 years’ worth of efforts by Mexico’s federal government, under two administrations, to reduce its financial vulnerability. Mexico ran into trouble in 1995 because its debt was (a) large, (b) mostly in foreign hands, (c) mostly short-term and (d) mostly in U.S. dollars. Mexico has been able to address all four sources of vulnerability in large part as a consequence of cleaning up its fiscal and monetary houses.\n\nMexico’s government is now able to rely mainly on domestic lenders. Three-fifths of net public-sector debt is now held by Mexican nationals, compared with a third in 1995. Mexico is also able to issue debt with much longer maturities. The country began issuing 20-year bonds in 2003. In 1995, its longest bond was a one-year bono. It would not surprise me at all if Mexico were to follow the example Russia set in February and issue a 30-year, peso-denominated bond in the near future.\n\nConfidence in Mexico’s financial markets has been reinforced by the stability and strength of the peso. The Tequila Crisis of 1994–95 started with a sharp currency devaluation. Mexico simply could no longer defend a fixed value of the peso. That is ancient history now. The peso has been floating for more than a decade, another factor easing markets’ fears about the potential for a financial crisis this year.\n\nWhat are the markets saying now? Foreign investors do not appear concerned about the upcoming presidential election becoming a breeding ground for an end-of-sexenio crisis. Mexico’s country premium—the added interest it must pay on its debt relative to comparable U.S. instruments—is near all-time lows.\n\nOf course, markets can be rational but at other times appear capricious. When interest rates are low, investors typically “reach for yield” by crawling out along the yield curve. When yield curves are flat or offer insufficient extra yield at longer maturities, investors can alternatively reach for yield by assuming greater credit risk and lending to lower-rated borrowers. If investors underestimate the amount of risk they are taking, subsequent disappointment may prove disruptive as sudden price swings cause investment holdings to turn unprofitable and investors seek to reduce positions.\n\nOf late, we have seen a predictable response to the tightening pursued by the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. While the Bank of Japan has technically not tightened policy, the end of the quantitative easing policy is a significant move in this direction. By implication, investors have to reach less far than previously to obtain reasonable yields. As a consequence, emerging market bond spreads have risen slightly, admittedly from very low levels. In addition, the currencies of several high-yield issuers have notably depreciated over the past month. Some examples include the Icelandic krona, Polish zloty, Hungarian forint, Turkish lira, and the Australian and New Zealand dollars.\n\nMy personal experience as a funds manager taught me at least two things: first, to respect the bond markets. You may recall James Carville’s quip that before he went to Washington with President Clinton, he thought the most powerful force in the world was the presidency or perhaps the papacy, but he quickly came to realize that it was the bond market.\n\nAndrew Mellon may have gotten it right when he said, “Gentlemen prefer bonds.” But a gentleman spurned can be unforgiving.\n\nThe second lesson I learned as a funds manager is that all financial markets, including those for fixed income and foreign exchange, can be somewhat manic-depressive. Markets can become skittish and are capable of overshooting on both the high and low ends. This is one reason I support the recent trend in increased central bank transparency, which reduces the elements of surprise that can unsettle markets. If the current environment of rising yields of relatively risk-free credits continues, there is a possibility that markets for emerging-country debt will become skittish. If so, even minor market-related developments may induce short-run volatility in those credits. Authorities in these countries will have to be increasingly sensitive about embracing policies or undertaking actions that might exacerbate that volatility.\n\nAgainst that background, we might now look at July’s presidential election. The presidential pyramid famously described by Octavio Paz has been turned upside down. Under the old system of PRI dominance, el presidente had near dictatorial and unassailable powers. This is no longer so, and from the standpoint of financial markets, I would posit that this is good news. Central bank independence, greater freedom of the press, an increasingly assertive Supreme Court and a divided Congress mean that whoever assumes office after the elections will have limited scope to single-handedly impose change.\n\nThe consensus view in financial markets is that rhetoric aside, none of the three presidential candidates is likely to reconsider Mexico’s commitment to macroeconomic discipline once in office. To be sure, the PRI and PRD have complained that monetary policy is “too tight,” but both parties appear to understand the importance of monetary discipline in keeping inflation under wraps. Any of the three candidates, once in office, should value the hard-earned financial stability of the previous administration and seek to build upon it. This is comforting.\n\nStability is critical to continued structural reform in Mexico. A look at the country’s ability to compete in the world economy is sufficient to understand how far it has to go. In its most recent competitiveness rankings, the Geneva-based International Institute for Management Development put Mexico near the bottom—56th out of 60, surpassing only Venezuela, Indonesia, Argentina and Poland. Mexico’s low productivity growth of only about 1.2 percent a year over the past decade is symptomatic of the problem.\n\nIn our increasingly globalized world, competitiveness is becoming more important. It is also becoming more complex. Gone are the days when a simple advantage in, say, labor costs or geography will be enough to attract foreign capital. Investors in today’s shrinking, interconnected world seek out countries that offer cost advantages, but they also seek out high levels of education and human capital, sound and reliable institutions, and other requisites for sustained long-run growth.\n\nOn the human capital side of the equation, Mexico has made great progress in the past few decades by increasing school enrollment and improving facilities. Nevertheless, many problems remain with regard to both the availability and quality of public education. More than half of adult Mexicans have no secondary schooling at all, and only 11.3 percent have any college or university training. Mexican adults have on average attended school for just 6.7 years, about half the U.S. level.\n\nRecognizing this fact, the Mexican government has ratcheted up education outlays in recent years, aiming to improve the nation’s schools. Spending per primary- and secondary-school student rose 21 percent in real terms between 1995 and 2002. Still, it remains low by international standards. Measured in purchasing power parity dollars, Mexico spent $1,467 per primary-school student in 2002, compared with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) average of $5,313 and the U.S. average of $8,049. Moreover, Mexican students’ math and reading scores rank dead last among the OECD countries and lag severely even when compared with those of other nations with similar educational spending, such as the Slovak Republic.\n\nThere are, of course, limits on how much Mexico’s government—or any government, for that matter—can increase spending on education. We know from our problems with education in the United States that added dollars or pesos may not produce results unless accompanied by innovative reforms. In Mexico’s case, experts believe such reforms should include improved school administration, better monitoring and incentives, and modernization of curricula and teaching techniques.\n\nThe Zedillo and Fox administrations recognized that better education is vital to the human-capital improvements that lead to greater labor productivity and competitiveness. But Mexico has only begun the task. I would expect the next government to continue emphasizing the need for improving the educational system.\n\nFrom a competitiveness standpoint, of course, spending on schools only pays off to the extent the economy puts educated workers to efficient use. Much of the inefficiency can be found in the sprawling informal sector, which employs roughly half of Mexico’s 44 million workers. A dual labor market has its pluses. The informal sector creates jobs for low-skilled workers, many of whom are priced out of the formal market. It is also home to most of Mexico’s entrepreneurs—self-employed and often industrious individuals who choose not to navigate the labyrinth of taxes and regulations that govern the formal market.\n\nInformality, however, also has negative implications. The small tax base increases tax rates on compliant firms, and this is both distortionary and unfair. In addition, informality limits firm size and undermines economies of scale. Companies find it difficult to grow, not only because they have little access to financial markets but also because the tax man eventually catches up with larger enterprises. In the end, small is safe but inefficient.\n\nFirms in the formal sector contend with other barriers. Mexican law and convention often constrain employers in how they organize production. Labor rules, for example, dictate that workers must be paid by the day or week, not by the hour. After three months of employment, a worker typically becomes “tenured.” Reducing the ranks of tenured employees is very costly; according to the World Bank, dismissal costs in Mexico equal about 75 weeks of pay. When it comes to international comparisons of labor-market rigidity, the only region of the world scoring worse than Mexico is sub-Saharan Africa. While employment in the formal sector is hog-tied with red tape, workers in the informal sector go without any protections at all. Thus, labor-market reform will be a high priority of the next administration. Whatever changes are eventually adopted, the ultimate goal should be to even the playing field by making the formal sector more accessible and less costly.\n\nNo manner of labor-market reform, of course, is going to keep Mexicans from seeking a better life on this side of the border. U.S. demographers estimate that 400,000 Mexicans migrate to the United States each year, legally and otherwise. A majority of them are seeking jobs. With about 9 million Mexican workers in the United States, the equivalent of 15 percent of Mexico’s labor force is employed here.\n\nOver the past two decades, the U.S. economy has become increasingly dependent on immigrants from Mexico and elsewhere for labor-force growth. In the 1960s, baby boomers contributed heavily to expanding labor supply. In the 1970s and early 1980s, it was the rapid entry of women into the workforce. Since the mid-1980s, it has been immigrants. In the past few years, foreign-born workers have accounted for more than half of U.S. labor-force growth, providing an important impetus for our economic growth. The subject of immigration is one that inflames passions on both sides of the border. For our part, we must be careful that legitimate security concerns do not interfere with the economic benefits of immigration.\n\nOf course, goods and services, as well as people, cross the border. You know the numbers. Since NAFTA took effect, U.S. trade with Mexico has risen 250 percent. Yet, neither Mexico nor the United States has done enough to handle the growing traffic. Surface trade is still much more inefficient and costly with Mexico than with Canada. The situation has become even more complex since the 9/11 tragedy increased the need for national security at our borders.\n\nFor Mexico and the U.S. states along its border, the stakes are high. Geographic proximity to the United States and ease of transport are key aspects of Mexico’s comparative advantage vis-à-vis nations in Asia and Eastern Europe. A loss of competitiveness in Mexico is a loss for the entire border economy, where so much of our growth is linked to expansion on the more populous Mexican side. We must pay greater attention to the changes in infrastructure, regulations and other areas that are needed to maximize mutual economic benefit from trade.\n\nDespite the impressive gains in U.S.–Mexico trade, old barriers persist and new obstacles have been erected. Shippers and visitors pay a huge cost in time and money for bottlenecks at the border. Examples include restricted movement of commercial vehicles, Mexican customs brokers’ practices, inadequate agency staffing and inspection facilities, and cumbersome U.S. customs processing and inspections. These transaction costs reduce the volume of trade and traffic and increase prices for traded goods. For example, about 47 percent of trucks cross the border empty—even empty trucks have to pass inspection—so this slows down the border crossing process. The U.S. Transportation Department estimates that cargo headed for the Mexican interior spends three to five days in a border warehouse before being released to continue its southbound journey. Both producers and consumers bear the burden of the higher transaction costs, and the U.S.–Mexico trade relationship is harmed. Solutions to the bottlenecks in cross-border transportation require changes in government and business practices on both sides.\n\nBefore closing, I want to discuss the need for reform in two other areas—the judiciary and the energy sector. Bluntly stated, Mexico’s court system does not typically function in a way that creates an environment favorable to lending and investment. Most critical for economic growth, property rights are often not effectively enforced in Mexico. According to the World Bank, average commercial dispute resolution time—how long it takes from the filing of a lawsuit to payment—is 421 days in Mexico, compared with 226 days in the other OECD countries.\n\nThis state of affairs has a number of consequences. First and foremost, banks and other financial institutions are reluctant to lend in an environment where contracts are difficult to enforce. Although credit has been expanding faster over the past two years, particularly in the consumer and residential segments, Mexico continues to have one of the world’s smallest financial sectors. The ratio of private loans to GDP is 10 times lower in Mexico than it is in the United States. If you factor in financial markets, there is more than 15 times more financial intermediation in the United States than in Mexico.\n\nThe factors that restrict access to capital hinder Mexico’s ability to grow. Weak enforcement also encourages resources to shift to the informal sector, which accounts for an estimated one-third of the overall economy’s output. Operating in the formal sector and abiding by labor laws and the tax code is costly. In most countries, a firm is partly “compensated” for assuming these burdens by gaining access to formal sources of financing, such as bank loans and export finance. In Mexico, however, outside financing is difficult to come by for most firms, even if they choose to operate in the formal sector. This further decreases incentives to follow the rules.\n\nThe Mexican government is aware of this problem and is improving matters. Bankruptcy and lending reforms adopted in 2000 and 2003 made it easier for creditors to collect debts in cases of insolvency by creating Mexico’s first effective legal framework for granting collateral. As welcome as these and other recent reforms are, they address only part of the issue. Mexico’s main problem is that its laws are often not well enforced. Having a reliable and transparent judiciary to enforce commercial as well as criminal law is a requirement for sustained growth in any country.\n\nAnother key element to economic success is infrastructure, an area in which Mexico needs further improvement. Necessary investments are hindered by lack of both funds and alternative providers. In the energy and electricity sectors, production and distribution are largely controlled by the public sector. Not surprisingly, given Mexico’s limited ability to raise taxes, capacity expansion has not kept pace with demand, and manufacturers and households must cope with frequent power interruptions. Meaningful energy reform will have to involve Pemex, a public-sector institution that has long been seen not only as a cash cow but as a politically sacred cow. Competition remains limited in other key industries as well. In the telecommunications sector, Telmex continues to control nearly 95 percent of all phone lines in Mexico. It should come as no surprise, then, that Mexico’s phone charges are among the world’s highest.\n\nMy friends, time is short. I think I have laid out enough challenges to keep Mexico very busy for at least another sexenio. Before ending, let me remind you of how far the country has come. Just the fact that we now compare it to other developed countries, that we talk about Mexico as one of the world’s most promising economies, is a tremendous change and reflects an incredible achievement. Mexico will face up to these challenges. Macroeconomic stability, out of reach for so long, is allowing Mexico to pursue the necessary reforms. The institutions are now in place for the transformation to really take hold and improve the lot of all Mexicans, más cerca de Dios y más cerca de los Estados Unidos!\n\nMuchas gracias. Thank you.",

            "content": "April 4, 2006 Midwestern State University, Wichita Falls, Texas\n\nI am delighted to be back in Wichita Falls. I spent some considerable time here in 1994, when I took leave of my senses and ran for the United States Senate. The good people of this city were always nice to me, especially Dottie Murphy, who is here today—thank you, Dottie. I remember the first time I met your wonderful mother, God rest her soul. She had on a white blouse, a jean skirt and bright red cowboy boots, and she looked a third her age and like the belle of the ball. She was a true Texas gem, and we all miss her.\n\nI ran that one time for office and that was it. Veni, Vidi, Defici: I came, I saw, I lost. It was not my cup of tea; I was no good at it and was a fish—or, I guess you can say, a fisher—out of water. I was better suited for the assignment of ambassador and trade negotiator of the United States. That, in turn, proved to be excellent preparation for what I do today as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and as a participant in the Federal Open Market Committee, the monetary policy setting body of the Federal Reserve System. Today is, in fact, the anniversary of my becoming Dallas Fed president last year. So I thought it might be of interest to share with you what I have gleaned from these past few years and what I am now up to as we speak. Before doing so, let me state at the outset that the views I express today are strictly my own and that I am not speaking for the Federal Open Market Committee or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAnd before getting into my prepared remarks, I want to acknowledge my traveling companion today, Wichita Falls’ and Midwestern’s own James Hoard. James is my right arm at the Fed. He is a superb counselor and friend and does his best to keep me out of trouble. James, raise your hand, so that if I do make any mistakes today, everyone will know who to blame.\n\nOne of my first acts as Dallas Fed president was to challenge our researchers to think deeply about how globalization is changing the ways our economy works—in particular, how we need to alter the rules and practices of monetary policy to accommodate an increasingly interconnected, interdependent global economy.\n\nThe literature on globalization is large. The literature on monetary policy is vast. But literature examining the combination of the two is surprisingly small.\n\nAt year-end last year, if you had Googled “globalization” and “monetary” and “policy,” you would have turned up more than 2 million references. However, a search of scholarly articles with the same word combination turned up 30,700. If you had narrowed your quest to the exact word combination “globalization and monetary policy,” you would have found a mere 39 citations. Limiting the word combination to the title of an article, you would have found only two.\n\nTom Friedman’s popular book The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century—a book I’ll bet many of you have read—doesn’t have a single entry on “money,” “monetary policy” or “central banking.” And in Michael Woodford’s influential book Interest and Prices: Foundations of a Theory of Monetary Policy—a book you probably haven’t read but should if you delight in economics—the word “globalization” does not appear in the index. Nor do the words “international trade” or “international finance.”\n\nWhat gives? Is the process of globalization disconnected from monetary policy? Is the business of the central bank totally divorced from globalization?\n\nI think not. I believe globalization and monetary policy are intertwined in a complex narrative that is only beginning to unfold.\n\nThere are many convoluted definitions of globalization. Mine is simple: Globalization means economic potential is no longer constrained by political and geographic boundaries. A globalized world is one where goods, services, capital, money, workers and ideas migrate to wherever they are most valued and can work together most efficiently, flexibly and securely.\n\nWhere does monetary policy come into play in this world? Well, consider the task of the central banker, seeking to conduct monetary policy to achieve maximum sustainable non-inflationary growth.\n\nFormer Federal Reserve Governor Larry Meyer gave an insider’s view of the process in his excellent little book A Term at the Fed. It was one of the first things I read as I prepared for my new job. In it, you get a good sense of the lexicon of monetary policy deliberations. The language of Fedspeak is full of sacrosanct terms, such as “output gap” and “capacity constraints.” There is the “natural rate of unemployment,” which morphed into “the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment,” or “NAIRU.” Central bankers want GDP to run at no more than its theoretical limit, for growing too fast for too long might stoke the fires of inflation. They do not wish to strain the economy’s capacity to produce.\n\nOne key capacity factor is the labor pool. A shibboleth known as the Phillips curve posits that unemployment falling beneath a certain level ignites demand for greater pay, with inflationary consequences for the entire economy.\n\nUntil recently, the econometric calculations of the various capacity constraints and gaps of the U.S. economy were based on assumptions of a world that exists no more. Meyer’s book is a real eye-opener because it describes in great detail the learning process of the FOMC members as the U.S. economy entered a new economic environment in the second half of the 1990s. At the time, economic growth was strong and accelerating. The unemployment rate was low, approaching levels unseen since the 1960s. In these circumstances, inflation was supposed to rise—if you believed in the Phillips curve and the prevailing views of potential output growth, capacity constraints and the NAIRU. That is what the models used by the Federal Reserve staff were saying, as was Meyer himself, joined by nearly all the other Fed governors and presidents gathered around the FOMC table. Under the circumstances, they concluded that monetary policy needed to be tightened to head off the inevitable. They were frustrated by Chairman Greenspan’s insistence they postpone the rate hikes.\n\nWe now recognize with 20/20 hindsight that Greenspan was the first to grasp changes in the traditional relationships among economic variables. The former chairman understood the data and the Fed staff’s modeling techniques, but he was also constantly talking—and listening—to business leaders. And they were telling him they were simply doing their job of seeking any and all means of earning a return for shareholders. At the time, they were being enabled by new technologies that enhanced productivity. The Information Age had begun rewriting their operations manuals. Earnings were being leveraged by technological advances. Productivity was surging. Inflation wasn’t rising. Indeed, it just kept on falling.\n\nIf the advice of Meyer and the others had prevailed, the Fed would have caused the economy to seriously underperform. According to some back-of-the-envelope calculations by economists I respect, real GDP would have been lower by several hundred billion dollars. Employment gains would have been reduced by perhaps a million jobs. The costs of not being right on the critical calibrations of monetary policy would have been huge.\n\nWe live in a globalizing era. Just consider what the fall of the Soviet Union, the implementation of Deng Xiaoping’s “capitalist road” in China and India’s embrace of market reforms mean to business operators. Consider labor alone. In the early ’90s, the former Soviet Union released millions of hungry workers into the system. China joined the World Trade Organization at the turn of the century and injected 750 million workers into play. And now India, with over 100 million English-speaking workers among its 1 billion people, has joined the game. Just two weeks ago, a CEO told me his company posted ads for people to apply for 9,000 jobs in a new facility in India. Do you know how many applications they received?—1,400,000.\n\nHow does this affect the American manager—paid to enhance returns to shareholders by growing revenues at the lowest possible costs? Because labor accounts for, on average, about two-thirds of the cost of producing most goods and services, the managers will go where labor is plentiful and cheapest. They will have a widget made in China or Vietnam, or a software program written in Russia or Estonia, or a center for processing calls or managing a back office set up in India.\n\nLet me tell you of one eye-opening experience. About two years ago, I was in London on business for Kissinger McLarty. I received a call from the head of Japan’s equivalent of the Business Roundtable, the Keidanren, asking me to “pop over tomorrow to give a luncheon and dinner speech.” They made an offer I couldn’t refuse, and I said I would be glad to do it if they could arrange the flights. They booked me on Virgin Air and arranged for a car to take me to Heathrow. At the appointed time, the car didn’t show up. So I called the number I had been given. The call was answered by a woman with a frightfully British accent. When I asked, “Could you kindly tell me where my car is, ma’am?” she deftly shifted to a Southwestern American accent and said, “Now don’t you worry. It is five minutes away. Ah apologize for the delay. Have a nice flight.”\n\nI said, “Well, hold on a minute. You answered this call in a British accent but once I spoke, you shifted to a Texas accent. Who are you? Where are you?”\n\n“Well,” she answered, “I am a call center operator in Bangalore.”\n\n“Have you ever been to the United States?” I asked.\n\n“Oh, no, sir. But I can tell that you are from Arkansas, Texas or New Mexico.”\n\n“And how do you learn to speak like me?”\n\n“Well, sir, for people like you, we watch a telly show called Walker, Texas Ranger.”\n\n“And what if I were from Boston?”\n\n“Ah, for those people we watch Cheers.”\n\nIt may seem like a small matter that a Japanese firm employed a worker in India to track a car by GPS in London and mimic a voice from Texas. But globalization impacts the conduct of business so much more profoundly, and therefore it impacts the expansion of our productive capacity and the pricing mechanism of labor and other inputs.\n\nThe destruction of communism and the creation of vast new sources of inputs and production have upset all the calculations and equations of the very best economics minds, including those of the Federal Reserve staff. Many of the old models simply do not apply in the new real world. This is why I think so many economists have been so baffled by the length of the current business cycle as well as the non-inflationary prosperity we have enjoyed for almost two decades.\n\nYou could sense something was wrong with the econometric equations if you listened to the troops on the ground, fighting in the trenches of the marketplace. This is what I did at the U.S. Trade Representative’s office in negotiating market-opening trade rounds with China, Vietnam, Mexico, Brazil and others. It is what my colleagues and I at Kissinger McLarty did while advising dozens of U.S. companies seeking entry into China and the former Soviet satellites and India and Latin America. It is what my colleagues and I on the FOMC do by making dozens upon dozens of calls to CEOs, COOs and CFOs of businesses, large and small, every month to prepare for FOMC meetings.\n\nWe are simply observing managers at work expanding the capacity of our economy, expanding the gap between what their previously limited resources would allow them to produce and what their newly expanded globalized, technologically enhanced reach now allows them to produce.\n\nFrom this, I personally conclude that we need to redraw the Phillips curve and rejig the equations that inform our understanding of the maximum sustainable levels of U.S. production and growth. How can economists quantify what the U.S. can produce with existing labor and capital when we don’t know the full extent of the global labor pool we can access? Or the totality of the financial and intellectual capital that can be drawn on to produce what we produce?\n\nSo what does the limited research on resource utilization and output gaps tell us? There are a few key, but preliminary findings from work done at the Bank for International Settlements—what many consider “the central bankers’ bank”—and some as yet unpublished work done by several of our Dallas Fed economists. Here are a few key points:\n\nAt first, I was encouraged on hearing these results. But then I was reminded about how difficult it is to accurately measure slack in the U.S. economy in real time. Data revisions in these measurements are often quite large. Imagine how much more difficult it is to measure in real time the degree of slack or capacity utilization that exists across the landscape of, say, 10 other economies across the globe!\n\nThe realization of the importance of global economic conditions for making monetary policy decisions is becoming more widespread. Several of my colleagues on the FOMC have offered encouragement to the globalization research efforts under way at the Dallas Fed. In February, I had the opportunity to give a speech in London and to meet with Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England. Foreign trade has long been important to the prosperity of the U.K. London’s financial markets play a pivotal role in global capitalism. So policymakers in the U.K. are used to thinking globally when it comes to making policy. After a robust conversation with Governor King, it became abundantly clear that we share many views on the importance of globalization for monetary policy. In recent years, globalization has manifested itself in the U.K. in the form of inflows of foreign workers that have alleviated labor market pressures and allowed the Bank of England to keep interest rates at levels lower than might otherwise be the case. Globalization has also shown up in greater external competitive pressures on U.K. firms, and thereby affected the dynamics of inflation in the U.K. Bank of England staff have an ongoing research project to understand the causes of what they refer to as the Great Stability and we refer to as the Great Moderation—the decline in inflation and output volatility that we have seen in many countries in recent years. Globalization is almost surely part of the explanation.\n\nRecognition of the importance of global economic forces for the making of economic policy is not limited to monetary policy. Just last week, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Justice Department decided not to impose any restrictions on the merger of Whirlpool and Maytag, two manufacturers of washing machines and clothes dryers that together control roughly 70 percent of the U.S. market. In the old days, this would be unthinkable. Today, the reason for not being too concerned with the potential for the combined companies to exert monopoly power is fairly straightforward. There are many manufacturers of laundry machines desirous of entering the U.S. market. In other words, there are abundant potential capacity and resources available outside the United States that can, and will likely, offer competition to Whirlpool/Maytag, thereby reducing their power to boost prices.\n\nI freely admit to you that I do not have the answers when it comes to globalization and monetary policy. I do believe that I am asking the right questions, as are my counterparts in many parts of the world. We at the Dallas Fed will continue to explore this topic, and we will share our findings with the public. We will have to, now that I have made them public right here at Midwestern! In fact, we are putting the finishing touches on a new study about how globalization shapes public policies—from innovation to the regulatory environment and quite a bit in between. It is fascinating stuff, and I look forward to sending it to you through James in about a week or so.",

            "content": "February 23, 2006 Dallas, Texas\n\nI want to thank the Greater Dallas Asian American Chamber of Commerce for the opportunity to speak here today. I was truly impressed to learn that your organization is the largest Asian-American chamber in the United States, with 1,200 members.\n\nAsian-Americans have achieved remarkable success and are a shining example of what can be achieved in this ongoing, unfinished experiment we call America. If you take a look at the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey, you will see that the average income of Asian households was $56,664—more than $12,000 above the U.S. average of $44,473. But the importance of the Asian-American community is not measured only by income level. You have ties to a wide range of countries where I spent a great deal of time during the second four years of the Clinton administration negotiating market-opening trade agreements—China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, India and many others. The economies of Dallas and of Texas benefit from the presence of the many internationally savvy businesspeople who belong to this chamber.\n\nYou are part of a growing economic connection between Texas and Asia. I am not sure how many of you know that Texas ranks No. 1 among the states in exports—with 14.5 percent of the U.S. total, eclipsing California’s 13 percent. Mexico, of course, is far and away our leading foreign market due to geographic proximity, but Asia has become quite important, too. Overall, nations across the Pacific buy 24 percent of our exports, more than twice Canada’s share. Five of Texas’ top seven overseas markets are in Asia—China, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Japan. China has been Texas’ fastest growing export market since 2002.\n\nTexas’ growing exports are just part of the larger topic I want to talk about today: the global economy and America’s position in it. Before doing so, I’ll issue the standard disclaimer of all Federal Reserve officials and those who sit on the Federal Open Market Committee: My views are just that—my own, assisted greatly by the magnificent research team backing me up at the Dallas Fed.\n\nThe U.S. economy is strong and very competitive. The economy is in something of a sweet spot right now. We have faced terrorist attacks and natural disasters, and yet our economy continues to steam along at a pace that forecasters estimate will in this current quarter be somewhere north of 4 percent, net of inflation. A total of 135 million Americans are at work. Unemployment has dropped to 4.7 percent, the lowest rate in four years. The underlying trend of core inflation has been running at roughly 2 percent, despite record-high energy prices.\n\nOur economy is performing well, but we all know about threats to our long-term prosperity and what needs to be done to prevent them from metastasizing. In addition to protecting our nation from Al Qaeda and other aggressors, on top of most lists would be the urgent need to rein in the fiscal deficits, solve the long-term imbalances built into our retirement and health care systems, and repair our educational system.\n\nSome will argue that we also need to protect ourselves from new sources of competition, like China and India. Indeed, there is a movement afoot in the Senate to impose a 27.5 percent levy on $243 billion of Chinese imports; in effect, it seeks to make American consumers and other importers pay a tax of $67 billion to protect themselves from cheap imports from China. Today, I am going to argue that that is precisely the wrong thing to do—not because it is readily transparent that an onerous tax on Chinese imports would be inflationary or because it would simply lead to the displacement of imports from China to other foreign sources, such as Vietnam. The underlying instinct implicit in this proposal—that we must protect ourselves from competition—is, in my humble opinion, faulty. We should embrace competition and exploit it to continue making ourselves even stronger.\n\nBut first, let me put the United States in perspective.\n\nThe United States produces $12.6 trillion a year in goods and services. That is big.\n\nHow big? Well, the Twelfth Federal Reserve District, headquartered in San Francisco, produces more output than all of China. The Eleventh District, headquartered here in Dallas, produces 20 percent more than India.\n\nThe incremental growth of the U.S. economy is in and of itself impressive. Let’s be conservative and assume we grow in 2006 at last year’s estimated rate of 3.5 percent, a rate that stands a good chance of being recalibrated upward when the final numbers are done. Growing at 3.5 percent for a year, we add $440 billion in incremental activity. That exceeds the entire output of all but 15 other countries. Every year, we create the economic equivalent of two Indonesias, three Thailands, four Malaysias or 11 Vietnams. Year, after year, after year.\n\nIn dollar terms, America’s 3.5 percent is equivalent to surges of 16 percent in Germany, 20 percent in the U.K., 26 percent in China and 70 percent in India.\n\nOf course, our growth is driven by consumption, a significant portion of which is fed by imports, which totaled $2 trillion last year. Our annual imports—what we buy in a single year from abroad—exceed the total output, the GDP, of all but four other countries. Our consumption provides a significant impetus for economic growth in the rest of the world.\n\nWe buy from the world a heck of a lot more than we sell. Last year, the trade deficit was estimated to have been $726 billion, a mighty big amount. A fourth of that was with China.\n\nSome see this as a threat. After the recent trade deficit was announced, the Financial Times of London quoted one commentator as saying, “These exploding deficit numbers are not a sign of strength; they are a sign of weakness. They indicate a slow bleeding at the wrists economically for the United States.”\n\nSome very influential policymakers and analysts, maybe even some of you in this very audience, are tempted to agree.\n\nBefore doing so, I would respectfully suggest that they do some simple math.\n\nLet’s examine the assertion that trade deficits are a sign of weakness by going back to look at what has happened to the U.S. economy since we last ran a trade surplus in 1975. Since that year, we have been running trade deficits that increase with each successive decade: to one-half of 1 percent of GDP in 1980, 1.3 percent of GDP in 1990, 3.9 percent of GDP in 2000 and 5.8 percent of GDP last year.\n\nHas the economy weakened? Here are the numbers. You be the judge.\n\nIn 2005 dollars—that is, adjusted for inflation—per capita GDP in 1975 was $22,383. Today, it’s $42,047.\n\nIn 2005 dollars, per capita disposable personal income in 1975 was $17,019. Today, it’s $30,429.\n\nIn 2005 dollars, mean household net worth was $195,000 at the end of 1975. Today, it’s $434,000.\n\nWhat these numbers tell us is that since 1975, the American people have become better off by a factor of two.\n\nWhat about those among you who are investors? How have you done?\n\nThe Standard & Poor’s 500 Index closed 1975 at 90. It closed yesterday over 14 times higher, at 1,292.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average closed at 852 in 1975. Last night the Dow closed at 11,137.\n\nThe purchasing power of consumers and investors has increased to a far greater degree than just their income levels and net worth because many of the things we buy and use have become better at ever-cheaper prices since 1975.\n\nIn 1975, a 19-inch Sears color TV cost $359.95 and a 25-inch console was $599.95. Today, a 20-inch Magnavox is $118.99 and a Sharp 27-inch model is $200.99. Today’s models have a much better picture, last longer, use less electricity and come with a whole host of added features, such as remote control.\n\nThe first PC, the Apple I computer, sold for $667 in 1976. It ran at the speed of 1 to 2 megahertz and had a 4k memory. Just $500 spent today on, say, a Dell Dimension E310 with a Pentium 4 processor will get you 2.87 billion times the processing power and millions of times the memory, with a free flat-panel screen and lots of other features.\n\nIn 1975, when I graduated from Stanford Business School, they didn’t have very sophisticated handheld calculators for financial analysts. In 1981, I bought this little guy, an HP12C calculator, which most investors will tell you is all you need to do the financial calculations of portfolio management. I use it to this day. It cost me $150. A couple of days ago, if you were to have looked on eBay as I did, you could have bought an HP12C for $5.\n\nWhat the numbers tell you is that we are far richer as individuals and as a nation than when we last ran a trade surplus. We are hardly “bleeding at the wrists economically” or becoming weaker as we have incurred trade deficits.\n\nThis is not to say that we can sit back, indifferent to the future. Presently, what we buy—oil from the OPEC countries, consumer electronics from the Asians, foodstuffs from Mexico—comes from countries that are not providing significant outlets at home for investing their savings. To continue to finance our external trade and current account imbalances, we have to be a magnet for the world’s surplus capital, attracting the investment money of those from whom we buy goods and services. The process recycles the money we pay out for purchases abroad back into our economy in the form of investments that make us richer, stronger and better positioned to compete more aggressively in trade markets.\n\nHere is the point: To be able to afford what we consume, we must continually improve ourselves. We must continue moving up the value-added ladder while others replace the work we used to do on the ladder’s lower rungs.\n\nOne of my favorite economists was a Czech-born professor from my alma mater named Joseph Schumpeter. He coined a term that appears to be a contradiction in terms but captures the essence of what is required to succeed in a fiercely competitive world: “creative destruction.” The United States has harnessed this process and made it work to constantly improve our global economic standing. Americans are masters of creative destruction.\n\nWhat do I mean when I say that? Well, let’s go back to the original expression of the term.\n\nIn his book Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy, Schumpeter wrote the following: “The fundamental impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion comes from the new consumers’ goods, the new methods of production or transportation, the new markets, the new forms of industrial organization…[and] incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one. This process of Creative Destruction is … what every capitalist concern has got to live in.”\n\nIn his book, Business Cycles, Schumpeter wrote: “A railroad through new country, i.e., country not yet served by railroads, as soon as it gets into working order upsets all conditions of location, all cost calculations, all production functions within its radius of influence; and hardly any ‘ways of doing things’ which have been optimal before remain so afterward.”\n\nHere is where China and India and all the bristling new economic entrants come in. They are today’s equivalent of Schumpeter’s railroads. They and the phenomenon of globalization are agents of creative destruction writ large. From now on, hardly any way of doing things which used to be optimal will ever be so again.\n\nCreative destruction is by no means painless. Let’s go back to 1975 again.\n\nSince 1975, as we started down the path of running ever-larger trade deficits, over 141 million Americans have filed unemployment claims. If you assume that there are others who either didn’t qualify to file or didn’t bother, you might reasonably conclude that 175 million jobs have been lost since 1975. That is the destructive side of creative destruction. That is the painful side for people like my dad who lost their jobs and more than once had to retrain for another one.\n\nBut then the creative side steps forward. Since 1975, the economy has replaced the jobs lost and more, adding another 57 million net new jobs to accommodate youth entering the workforce, a surge in immigrants and—very important—significant numbers of women who joined and enriched the workplace. This is the gratifying part of the process. This is the good news. If we create the conditions to let our private sector do what it does by its very nature—constantly adapt and reposition itself—then we have nothing to fear from competition from our trading partners, including those with whom we presently run big deficits.\n\nWe do, indeed, have some tough competitors out there.\n\nBut we have some unique advantages.\n\nAmerica’s economy encourages change. We provide a healthy environment to nurture entrepreneurs. We have not saddled the private sector with regulations that interfere with hiring and firing or dictate outmoded methods of production.\n\nConsider this: Starting a business takes five days in the United States, compared with 45 days in Germany, 108 in Spain and no one knows how many in China. We let labor, capital and companies compete—within the country and with the rest of the world. Our economy continually reorganizes itself to take advantage of new technologies, freeing labor from old jobs so it can move to new, higher-value uses.\n\nThe agent of reorganization is not the government or the central bank but the talent of our business managers, something that economists rarely talk about. These managers are the key to our continued adaptation and growth. They are our greatest comparative advantage.\n\nI like to say that the managers in our business community serve as the nerve endings in Adam Smith’s invisible hand, stretching capitalism’s fingers into every corner of the world to extract value at the lowest cost—in order to enhance productivity.\n\nI am not talking just about CEOs who get paid big bucks. I am talking about the millions of middle managers who operate supply chains, control inventories and fine-tune operations.\n\nEvery day, these managers get up and go to work to exploit those competitors who come to market with cheaper products by buying those products and using them as inputs for providing better deals to their customers.\n\nThey are the masters of the best manifestation of “creative destruction.”\n\nThey are the folks who exert the gravitational pull for the recycling of those monies we pay out to secure cheaper inputs. Their ability to wring value out of all sources, everywhere, is what makes the United States the preferred risk-adjusted destination for surplus investment monies.\n\nThey are the people who enable us to finance our external deficits, and inevitably redress them.\n\nThey are the key to our transforming what some perceive as a weakness into a fundamental strength.\n\nAs long as the Federal Reserve does its job of holding inflation at bay, and as long as our political leaders resist protectionism and let the private sector get on with its work, we will remain the world’s predominant economic machine. If we resort to protectionism and other forms of interference with creative destruction, then we will indeed be slitting our own wrists, draining the world of the lifeblood of U.S. economic growth.",

            "content": "February 14, 2006 Little Rock\n\nI spent three years negotiating trade agreements around the world for President Clinton, whom I first met when he was governor, right here in Little Rock. My oldest son was an intern in Mack McLarty’s office when he was chief of staff to the president, and after my work as a trade representative, I had the pleasure of being Mack’s partner in his venture with Henry Kissinger.\n\nThis is all by way of saying that the president and Mack taught me a lot about Arkansas.\n\nThat Patmos, with a population, I recall, of 32, is the smallest town in Arkansas—unless two or three die or move out of Oakhaven.\n\nThat Hope is the state’s heart and Little Rock the brains and that Bentonville, as anybody who shops knows, has a whole lot of muscle.\n\nThat Blanchard Springs Caverns in Stone County ought to be one of the Ten Natural Wonders of the World.\n\nThat the Razorbacks ought to be another one.\n\nI like Mack so much that I would always just grin at him and nod when he bragged on Arkansas. And no matter who the president is, Democrat or Republican, you almost always say, “Yes, sir, Mr. President.”\n\nBut I hope you will forgive me for telling you that I drew the line at their referring to the great state of Texas as “Baja Arkansas,” refusing to do so even when Mack would put me in a hammerlock and give me noogies.\n\nLet’s just say that on a beautiful, springlike day like this, reading about those snowstorms up East in this morning’s Democrat-Gazette, Arkansans and Texans are one and the same at having been blessed to be joined at the hip, right here in the sweet spot of America.\n\nI want to talk to you today about the global economy and America’s position within it. Before doing so, I’ll issue the standard disclaimer of all Federal Reserve officials and those who sit on the Federal Open Market Committee: My views are just that—my own, assisted greatly by the magnificent research team I have backing me up in Dallas.\n\nI will give you the bottom line up front: The U.S. economy is strong and very competitive. The economy is in a sweet spot of its own, thanks to private-sector leadership. One hundred and thirty-five million Americans are at work. Unemployment has dropped to 4.7 percent, the lowest rate in four years. We have faced terrorist attacks and natural disasters, and yet our economy continues to steam along at a pace that the consensus of economists estimates will be somewhere north of 4 percent in this current quarter, after netting out inflation, which we have maintained at or near the 2 percent level despite record-high energy prices.\n\nThe Federal Reserve, as your central bank, is and will remain ever vigilant in pursuing its mandate of providing the monetary policy required for sustainable non-inflationary growth.\n\nThat said, we all know what the threats are to our long-term prosperity and what needs to be done to prevent them from metastasizing. In addition to protecting our nation from Al Qaeda and other aggressors, on top of most lists would be the urgent need to rein in the fiscal deficits, solve the long-term imbalances built into our retirement and health care systems, and repair our educational system.\n\nSome will argue that we also need to protect ourselves from new sources of competition, like China and India and Vietnam, and the nations liberated from Soviet dominance by the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n\nToday, I am going to argue that that is precisely the wrong thing to do. Rather than protect ourselves from competition, we should embrace it and exploit it in order to make ourselves even stronger.\n\nBut first, let me put the United States in perspective.\n\nThe United States produces $12.6 trillion a year in goods and services. That is big.\n\nHow big? Well, let’s be conservative. Let’s assume that in 2006 we grow at what was estimated as last year’s rate of 3.5 percent (before the data for the last quarter are revised upward, which I expect they will be).\n\nIf we grew at 3.5 percent for a year, we would add $440 billion in incremental activity. That exceeds the entire output of all but 15 other countries. Every year, we create the economic equivalent of a Sweden—or two Irelands, or three Argentinas. Year, after year, after year.\n\nNobody else has that heft.\n\nIn dollar terms, a growth rate of 3.5 percent in the U.S. is equivalent to growth surges of 16 percent in Germany, 20 percent in the U.K., 26 percent in China and 70 percent in India.\n\nOf course, our growth is driven by consumption, a significant portion of which is fed by imports, which totaled $2 trillion last year. Our annual import volume—what we buy in a single year from abroad—exceeds the total output, the GDP, of all but four other countries: Japan, Germany, Britain and France.\n\nWe buy from the world a heck of a lot more than we sell. Last year, the trade deficit was estimated to have been $726 billion, a mighty big amount. A fourth of that was with China.\n\nSome see this as a threat. After the recent trade deficit was announced, the Financial Times of London quoted one commentator as saying, “These exploding deficit numbers are not a sign of strength; they are a sign of weakness. They indicate a slow bleeding at the wrists economically for the United States.” Some of you in this audience might be tempted to agree.\n\nBefore you do so, let’s look at the numbers.\n\nLet’s examine the assertion that trade deficits are a sign of weakness by going back to look at what has happened to the U.S. economy since we last ran a trade surplus, which was in 1975. After 1975, we began to run up trade deficits. In each successive year they have increased: to one-half of 1 percent of GDP in 1980, 1.3 percent of GDP in 1990, 3.9 percent of GDP in 2000 and 5.8 percent of GDP last year.\n\nHas the economy weakened? You be the judge. Here are the numbers.\n\nIn 2005 dollars, per capita disposable personal income in 1975 was $17,019. Today, it’s $30,429.\n\nIn 2005 dollars, per capita GDP in 1975 was $22,383. Today, it’s $42,047.\n\nIn 2005 dollars, mean household net worth was $195,000 in 1975 (fourth quarter). Today, it’s $434,000.\n\nWhat these numbers tell us is that since 1975, the American people have become better off by a factor of two, net of inflation.\n\nWhat about those among you who are investors? How have you done?\n\nThe Standard & Poor’s 500 Index closed 1975 at 90. It closed yesterday over 14 times higher, at 1,263.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average closed at 852 in 1975. Last night the Dow closed at 10,892.\n\nThe purchasing power of consumers and investors has increased to a far greater degree than just their income levels and net worth, because many of the things you buy and use have become better at ever-cheaper prices since 1975.\n\nIn 1975, a 19-inch Sears color TV cost $359.95 and a 25-inch console was $599.95. Today, a 20-inch Magnavox is $118.99 and a Sharp 27-inch model is $200.99. Today's models have a much better picture, last longer, use less electricity, and come with a whole host of added features such as remote control.\n\nThe first PC, the Apple I computer, sold for $667 in 1976. It ran at the speed of 1 to 2 megahertz and had a 4k memory. Just $500 spent today on, say, a Dell Dimension E310 with a Pentium 4 processor will get you 2.87 billion times the processing power and millions of times the memory, with a free flat-panel screen and lots of other features.\n\nIn 1975, when I graduated from Stanford Business School, they didn’t have very sophisticated handheld calculators for use by financial analysts. In 1981, I bought this little guy, an HP12C calculator, which most investors will tell you is all you need to do financial calculations for portfolio management; I use it to this day. It cost me $150. Yesterday, if you were to have looked on eBay at 11:32 a.m., you could have bought an HP12C for $5.\n\nWhat the numbers tell you is that we are far richer as individuals and as a nation than when we last ran a trade surplus. We are hardly “bleeding at the wrists economically” or becoming weaker as we have incurred trade deficits.\n\nThis is not to say that we can sit back, indifferent to the future. Presently, the countries we buy from—oil from the OPEC countries, consumer electronics from the Asians, foodstuffs from Mexico—are not providing significant venues at home for investing their surplus savings. To be able to finance our external trade and current account imbalances, we have to remain a magnet for that surplus capital, attracting investments from those from whom we buy goods and services, recycling what we pay out to make purchases abroad back into our economy in the form of investments that make us still richer and stronger, and meanwhile position us to compete more aggressively in trade markets.\n\nThat is a mouthful. Here is the point: To be able to afford what we consume, we must continually improve ourselves. We must continue moving up the value-added ladder while others replace the work we used to do on the lower rungs of that ladder.\n\nOne of my favorite economists was a Czech-born professor from my alma mater, named Joseph Schumpeter. He coined a term that appears to be a contradiction in terms but captures the essence of what is required to succeed in a fiercely competitive world: “creative destruction.” The United States has harnessed this process and made it work to constantly improve our global economic standing. Americans are masters of creative destruction.\n\nWhat do I mean when I say that? Well, let’s go back to the original expression of the term.\n\nIn his book Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy, Schumpeter wrote the following: “The fundamental impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion comes from the new consumers’ goods, the new methods of production or transportation, the new markets, the new forms of industrial organization…[and] incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one. This process of Creative Destruction is … what every capitalist concern has got to live in.”\n\nIn his book, Business Cycles, he wrote: “A railroad through new country, i.e., country not yet served by railroads, as soon as it gets into working order upsets all conditions of location, all cost calculations, all production functions within its radius of influence; and hardly any ‘ways of doing things’ which have been optimal before remain so afterward.”\n\nHere is where China and India and all the bristling new economic entrants come in. They are today’s equivalent of Schumpeter’s railroads. They and the phenomenon of globalization are agents of creative destruction writ large. From now on, hardly any way of doing things which used to be optimal will ever be the same.\n\nOr as that master of the creative destruction of syntax, Yogi Berra, would say, now that China and India and the others have entered the game, history just ain’t what it used to be.\n\nCreative destruction is by no means painless. Let’s go back to 1975 again.\n\nSince 1975, as we started down the path of running ever-larger trade deficits, over 141 million Americans have filed unemployment claims. If you assume that there were more who either didn’t qualify to file or didn’t bother, you might reasonably conclude that 175 million jobs have been lost since 1975. That is the destructive side of creative destruction. That is the painful side for people like my dad who lost their jobs and more than once had to retrain for another one.\n\nBut then the creative side steps forward. Since 1975, the economy has replaced the jobs lost and more, adding another 57 million net new jobs to accommodate youth entering the workforce, a surge in immigrants and—very important—significant numbers of women who joined and enriched the workplace. This is the gratifying part of the process. This is the good news. If we create the conditions to let our private sector do what it does by its very nature— constantly adapt and reposition itself—then we have nothing to fear from competition from our trading partners, including those with whom we presently run big deficits.\n\nWe do, indeed, have some tough competitors out there.\n\nBut we have some unique advantages.\n\nAmerica’s economy encourages change. We provide a healthy environment to nurture entrepreneurs. We have not saddled the private sector with regulations that interfere with hiring and firing or dictate outmoded methods of production.\n\nConsider this: Starting a business takes five days in the United States, compared with 45 days in Germany, 108 in Spain and no one knows how many in China. We let labor, capital and companies compete—within the country and with the rest of the world. Our economy continually reorganizes itself to take advantage of new technologies, freeing labor from old jobs so it can move to new, higher-value uses.\n\nThe agent of reorganization is not the government or the central bank but the talent of our business managers, something that economists rarely talk about.

They are our greatest comparative advantage.\n\nI like to say that the managers in our business community serve as the nerve endings in Adam Smith’s invisible hand, stretching capitalism’s fingers into every corner of the world to extract value at the lowest cost—in order to enhance productivity.\n\nI am not talking just about CEOs who get paid big bucks.

            "content": "February 6, 2006 London\n\nI am honored to be here today. The Fishers trace their roots to Surrey, our familial home until British authorities “encouraged” the more, shall we say, entrepreneurial side of the family to relocate to Australia. With the passing of time, we were welcomed back—to the Middle Common Room at Oxford’s Hertford College, where as a graduate student I met my wife and cemented a special affection for any and all things British.\n\nI have been asked to speak on the U.S. economy and will do so shortly. As you might expect from the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, I will dispense a little “Texas brag.” But no one who tills the fields of economics, not least a central banker, can stand in a British forum without a sense of humility and gratitude. You invented the “dismal science” that my Fed colleagues and I do our level best to put into constructive practice.\n\nSmith, Mill, Hume, Malthus, Ricardo, Keynes—even Marx—derived their economic theories on British soil, giving us principles and disciplines we have sought to perfect in the American economic machine. As you know, we Americans do love debt! And it is to the great economic intellects of England that we are most profoundly indebted.\n\nMy kind hosts, who had no idea that this event would follow so closely on the heels of the meager growth estimate reported for last year’s fourth quarter, have asked me to address the question: Is the United States still the growth engine for the world?\n\nThe answer is yes.\n\nLet me explain why.\n\nThe American economy has been on an upswing for more than four years. Growth advanced briskly at 4.2 percent in 2004. It slowed to a still solid 3.5 percent in 2005, although I would not be surprised if GDP were revised upward when we take a more definitive look at the fourth quarter. In January, the U.S. economy employed 134.6 million people, up 2.2 million in a year. Unemployment stood at a four-year low of 4.7 percent, which compares with the latest reading of 8.4 percent for Europe and even higher rates for some of the continent’s major economies.\n\nWe have weathered hurricanes’ fury and record-high energy prices while continuing to grow and keep inflation under control. The statement the Federal Open Market Committee released Tuesday quite summed up our current situation succinctly: “Although recent economic data have been uneven, the expansion in economic activity appears solid.”\n\nThis is especially true in what I call the “growth rim”—an arc of population centers with favorable demographics that begins in Virginia, runs down the southeastern seaboard through Georgia to Florida, then through the megastate of Texas and on to the uberstate of California and up to Seattle. I use “mega” and “uber” to describe the two largest states for a reason: to illustrate the depth and breadth of our economy. In dollar terms, Texas produces 20 percent more than India, and California produces roughly the same output as China. To the extent there is weakness in the U.S. economy, it is in the Northeast and North Central states.\n\nNetting all this out, the consensus of most economic forecasters is that growth in the first quarter will rebound to a rate well above 4 percent.\n\nTo understand what this kind of growth means, we need only follow Margaret Thatcher’s wise hectoring to “do the math.” The United States produces $12.6 trillion a year in goods and services. Be conservative—once again, Lady Thatcher would like it—and assume that in 2006 we grow at last year’s preliminary rate of 3.5 percent. The math tells us we would add $440 billion in incremental activity—in a single year.\n\nThat is a big number. What we add in new economic activity in a given year exceeds the entire output of all but 15 other countries. Every year, we create the economic equivalent of a Sweden—or two Irelands or three Argentinas. In dollar terms, a growth rate of 3.5 percent in the U.S. is equivalent to surges of 16 percent in Germany, 20 percent in the U.K., 26 percent in China and 70 percent in India.\n\nOf course, our growth is driven by consumption, a significant portion of which is fed by imports, which totaled $2 trillion last year. Again, do the math: Our annual import volume—what we buy in a single year from abroad—exceeds the GDP of all but four other countries—Japan, Germany, Britain and France.\n\nSo, yes, the United States is the growth engine for the world economy. And it is important that it remain so because no other country appears poised to pick up the torch if the U.S. economy stumbles or tires.\n\nAre there reasons to worry it might do so? In fashionable circles and at various “chat shows” like Davos, you certainly hear many.\n\nOf immediate concern is the potential bursting of the so-called housing bubble. Some parts of the United States have experienced uncommon acceleration of housing prices. We are all familiar with what occurred in the U.K., Australia and the Netherlands, where a deceleration of housing prices hit consumption hard. As a result, many a jaundiced eye is being cast on the U.S., where mortgage debt service as a percentage of disposable income has risen in recent years and consumption has been partly financed by equity aggressively “extracted” from the housing stock through ever more novel financial products.\n\nAgain, it is important to do the math.\n\nCurrently, 80 percent of U.S. homeowners have fixed-rate mortgages. Just one in five has a variable-rate mortgage. The majority of the latter are so-called hybrids, carrying a fixed rate for a few years before converting to a floating rate. Roughly 80 percent of these mortgages are scheduled to have their rates reset; however, the impact will not occur all at once but will be stretched out over the next several years.\n\nIt is true that homeowners with variable-rate loans borrow larger amounts. It is also true that they have higher incomes. The median borrower with a variable-rate mortgage devotes a smaller portion of household income to debt payments than those with fixed-rate loans.\n\nIn recent years, the analytically nettlesome Interest-Only—or IO—mortgages have become a significant percentage of housing loans in some markets. Unlike other mortgages, payments on IOs increase when the interest-only term expires and borrowers are required to make principal as well as interest payments. These mortgages pack a double whammy when rates reset after the IO period expires. Many of these mortgages, however, have long periods during which the interest rate and IO period are locked up. Given that the average mortgage is held only six or seven years, many houses will be sold or refinanced before the amortization period ever kicks in.\n\nGiven this, I will let you draw your own conclusions about whether the housing market’s financial dynamics will strain the U.S. economy as interest rates rise in response to Federal Reserve tightening. It is not unreasonable to think the situation is manageable, albeit worth watching closely. And this so-called cloud may even have a silver lining, as noted recently by Scott Burns, the astute American syndicated columnist. When people have to make money from their jobs, rather than from their homes, perhaps they will focus more on their work and what they produce. Not an altogether bad set of priorities!\n\nThe other preoccupation is the U.S. current account deficit, a subject second only in popularity to the ongoing saga of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. America’s large trade deficits have been discussed for so long by so many eminent analysts that I have little to add—except to remind you that it takes two to tango. Those urging the United States to rein in its spending should be equally full-throated in prodding countries with excess savings and trade surpluses to create conditions for growing their domestic demand. If they fail to do so, and the U.S. suddenly becomes virtuous on its own, the global economy would sink into a deep funk.\n\nSo if there is a ready substitute for the United States as the consumer of first and last resort for many developing economies, I would like someone to tell me which country, or group of countries, might fill the bill. As our new Fed Chairman, Ben Bernanke, made clear in a speech last April, this issue entails a lot of moving parts, but the counterpart to scant saving in the United States is excess savings by other countries and/or underinvestment in their own countries.\n\nI want to spend the remainder of my time at the podium talking about the long-run position of the United States. One of my favorite recollections from my days at Oxford is the story of John Maynard Keynes at the Bretton Woods conferences. He grew terrifically frustrated at the arrogance of the Americans and complained bitterly to Lord Halifax, the British ambassador. Halifax, who no doubt bore in mind the British legacy of intellectual thought that I cited earlier, sought to comfort him. Thus it was written:\n\nThe key to the American economy’s success in recent years—the wellspring of our growth— has been a unique combining of money and brains to enhance productivity, the ability to turn out more goods and services from our labor and other factors of production. This, I submit immodestly, we have done well. During the great post–World War II boom, productivity grew 2.7 percent a year from 1950 to 1973. It then slowed to an anemic 1.5 percent from 1974 to 1995, leading the denizens of Davos and other salons during the 1980s to extrapolate dark thoughts from then-fashionable titles like Ezra Vogel’s Japan as Number One, published in 1979, and Paul Kennedy’s The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, published in 1988. But just when it appeared Japan would pass America, we took a turn for the better. U.S. productivity ramped up to growth rates of 2.9 percent a year from 1996 to 1999 and 3.2 percent a year from 2000 to 2005.\n\nNew technology fed the productivity surge. The microprocessor led to a host of productivity-enhancing tools—increasingly miniaturized yet more powerful computers, cell phones, the Internet, bar-code scanners, fiber-optic cables—countless innovations that enhanced business managers’ ability to automate operations, rationalize inventories, enhance customer service, process data, move information and cut costs.\n\nThe Information Age technologies were available in nearly all countries, but few reaped the same productivity gains as the United States. Over the past decade, productivity growth in the European Union’s 15 core countries, for example, has averaged 1 percent a year, far less than the United States.\n\nThe key to wringing more from the new technologies lies in the American economy’s adaptability. We let the economy change. We provide a healthy environment to nurture entrepreneurs. Starting a business takes five days in the United States, compared with 45 days in Germany and 108 in Spain. We have not saddled the private sector with regulations that interfere with hiring and firing or dictate outmoded methods of production. We let labor, capital and companies compete—within the country and with the rest of the world. Our economy continually reorganizes itself to take advantage of new technologies, freeing labor from old jobs so it can move to new, higher-value uses.\n\nThe Lex Column in Friday’s Financial Times noted that Joseph Schumpeter called the capitalist process “creative destruction,” a marvelous phrase that captures the two-sided nature of economic progress. I like Schumpeter—despite the fact he never spent significant time in England—because his writings focus the mind on the process of change and adaptation. They are particularly relevant today. Listen carefully to these three quotes from two of his seminal works.\n\nIn his book Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy, Schumpeter wrote: “The fundamental impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion comes from the new consumers’ goods, the new methods of production or transportation, the new markets, the new forms of industrial organization that capitalist enterprise creates.”\n\nFrom that same page: “The opening up of new markets, foreign or domestic, and the organizational development from the craft shop and factory … illustrate the same process of industrial mutation … that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one. This process of Creative Destruction is the essential fact about capitalism. It is … what every capitalist concern has got to live in.”\n\nAnd from volume 1 of Schumpeter’s Business Cycles: “A railroad through new country, i.e., country not yet served by railroads, as soon as it gets into working order upsets all conditions of location, all cost calculations, all production functions within its radius of influence; and hardly any ‘ways of doing things’ which have been optimal before remain so afterward.”\n\nString the key phrases of those three citations together and you get the bottom-line plot of capitalism’s process of creative destruction: “The opening up of new markets, foreign or domestic ... revolutionizes the economic structure, ... destroying the old one, . . . creating a new one .... [It] upsets all conditions of location, all cost calculations, all production functions, ... and hardly any ways of doing things which have been optimal before remain so afterward.”\n\nHere is where China and India and all the bristling new economic entrants come in. They are today’s equivalent of Schumpeter’s railroads. They and the phenomenon of globalization are agents of creative destruction writ large. From now on, hardly any way of doing things which used to be optimal will ever be the same.\n\nI posit that China and India and the new players will enhance American productivity and abet U.S. growth, not threaten it. These rising economies will provide sources of inputs American companies can use to drive down costs and increase variety for consumers. They will increase competition—which is good. Competition sharpens the wits and improves muscle tone. Facing foreign competition head-on will keep us at the forefront of the global economy by encouraging businesses to do what they should do: create jobs and profits in a virtuous cycle that, properly nurtured by monetary and fiscal policy, goes on indefinitely.\n\nNote that I mentioned monetary policy. I would like to think that America’s greatest asset is the wisdom and steady hand of its central bank. But truth be told, wise and temperate monetary policy is a necessary but insufficient condition for America’s success. Our greatest asset is our inherent flexibility and the private sector’s ability to capitalize on the ever-changing economic landscape. Our comparative advantage lies in the millions of managers in our business community who serve as the nerve endings in Adam Smith’s invisible hand, stretching capitalism’s fingers into every corner of the world to extract value at the lowest cost—to enhance productivity. They adapt to economic change with breathtaking alacrity. I am not talking just about CEOs but also about middle managers who operate supply chains, control inventories and fine-tune operations. As long as the Federal Reserve does its job of holding inflation at bay, and as long as our political leaders resist protectionism and other forms of interference with creative destruction, we will remain a productive economic machine.\n\nAt the Dallas Fed, we refer to the process of creative destruction as “the churn.” I mentioned Ezra Vogel’s and Paul Kennedy’s works, which provide bookends of a sort for the 1980s. In preparing for this speech, I asked my staff to look at what has happened to the U.S. economy since that period, when it was fashionable to talk of America’s demise.\n\nTherein is the math of the churn.\n\nFrom 1980 to 2005, American workers filed 118 million claims for unemployment insurance. Many others lost their jobs, of course, but either didn’t qualify for benefits, were not unemployed long enough to file a claim, or quickly transitioned to new jobs. It is hard to find a figure that would include all the job losses, but it would be more than 150 million, surely. That is the destructive and painful side of the churn.\n\nYet, despite all these job losses:\n\nTotal employment over the period rose by 44 million—net. At annual rates, unemployment fell from 7.2 percent to today’s 4.7 percent. Productivity increased by 72 percent. Per capita real GDP shot up from $26,113 to $42,760. The average workweek fell by nearly two hours to 33.7 hours, and average household real net worth more than doubled to $431,000. That is the creative and restorative side of the churn. All this was accomplished, by the way, with less economic downtime. Since the beginning of 1982, the United States has had just 16 months of recession, compared with 43 in France, 70 in Germany and 82 in Japan.\n\nIn short, the churn works. If we allow the market system to recycle our labor to new, higher-value-added jobs, it will keep us working, productive, well paid and richer, with better jobs and more time to enjoy life.\n\nMervyn King was spot-on in his speech in Kent just three weeks ago when he noted that “a willingness to adapt and embrace, rather than resist, change is the key to greater prosperity. That road may at times be hard going...but it leads ultimately to a more prosperous destination.”\n\nP. G. Wodehouse, who wasn’t an economist or a central banker but who sprouted in British soil, would have put it this way: In a globalized, Shumpeterian world, it is simply not true that plus ça change results in the même chose. America’s business managers get it. The British business community gets it. Continental Europe’s private-sector managers are equally up to the task of adapting to compete. It is up to the continent’s political leaders to create conditions that liberate the private sector to reignite the combined mass of Europe’s economies as an engine of growth while the ECB ensures that business remains undistracted by inflation.\n\nUntil then, the task of being the world’s economic engine falls to the United States.",

            "content": "January 19, 2006 Fort Worth, Texas\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nLong ago, the case for competition was articulated by such economists as Adam Smith and David Ricardo. At a private dinner last night, Chairman Greenspan reminded a group of us that Smith and Hume and Ricardo and Malthus and Keynes were all British, and it is to our British brethren that we owe our key understanding of economic principles. I would also draw on my own alma mater, the TCU of the East—Harvard—to credit one other economist for insights that put today’s world in perspective: a Czech educated in Vienna who taught at Harvard in the ’40s, Joseph Schumpeter. Schumpeter articulated the concept of “creative destruction.” Let me read you three excerpts from two of Schumpeter's seminal works.\n\nFirst, from Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy: “The fundamental impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion comes from the new consumers’ goods, the new methods of production or transportation, the new markets, the new forms of industrial organization that capitalist enterprise creates.”\n\nFrom that same page: “The opening up of new markets, foreign or domestic, and the organizational development from the craft shop and factory…illustrate the same process of industrial mutation…that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one. This process of creative destruction is the essential fact of capitalism. It is…what every capitalist concern has got to live in.”\n\nAnd from volume 1 of Schumpeter’s Business Cycles: “A railroad through new country, i.e., a country not yet served by railroads, as soon as it gets into working order upsets all conditions of location, all cost calculations, all production functions within its radius of influence; and hardly any ‘ways of doing things’ which have been optimal before remain so afterward.”\n\nString the key operative phrases of those three citations together and you get the plot of this story, the plot of globalization: “The opening up of new markets, foreign or domestic . . . revolutionizes the economic structure, . . . destroying the old one, . . . creating a new one. . . . [It] upsets all conditions of location, all cost calculations, all production functions, . . . and hardly any ways of doing things which have been optimal before remain so afterward.”\n\nThe master of creative destruction of syntax, Yogi Berra, put it more eloquently: Once you open new markets, “History just ain’t what it used to be.”\n\nGlobalization and the emergence of Chinese and Indian and other new competition is “creative destruction” writ large. We cannot hide from it. We can only rise to the occasion, channel it and adapt in order to benefit from it, rather than succumb to it.\n\nI submit to you that the country that took in my father and mother—the land that made me possible—is flexible and dynamic and bold enough to succeed and, indeed, prosper from what Steve Roach of Morgan Stanley calls “the heat of China’s emergence.” We will do so as long as the Federal Reserve does its job of ensuring the monetary backdrop for sustained non-inflationary economic growth and as long as our political leaders refrain from fiscal promiscuity or from false remedies such as protectionism. I will do my part to ensure the former. You must do yours to ensure the latter with those you elect to represent you.\n\nIt will be more difficult for the other developed economic powers of the world to cope with the “Chinese heat.” In my book, the recent German elections were about preventing a hollowing out of the German economy: Now Chancellor Merkel, a woman who understands instinctively the shortcomings of socialism, must lead Germany through a tectonic transformation. France’s old political elite have resisted adapting, but new political actors are grappling with it, and time will tell if the French have the wherewithal to survive as a linchpin of the European economy.\n\nItaly, the third European economic power, is also in need of radical transformation. At present, it is the English-speaking nations—England, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and the U.S. (and, to give credit where credit is due, the Scandinavians and the Spaniards)—that are adapting best.\n\nWhich brings us to Japan and the current turmoil on the Japanese stock exchange and the issue of Livedoor and its CEO, Takafumi Horie.\n\nI met Horie-san in 2003, when, if memory serves, his company’s shares were trading at 12 yen. They rose to over 700 yen before their recent drop to 496. I have no idea if Horie-san’s accounting practices are valid or not. The reason I mention this matter is by way of illustrating adaptation.\n\nI lived in Tokyo in 1990 and ran my portfolio out of Nomura’s offices there while my oldest son played baseball in the Tokyo Junior Boys League. Perhaps because of that, when I was named deputy U.S. trade representative, I was appointed co-chairman, alongside the deputy foreign minister of Japan, of the Commission on Competition and Deregulation, a device thought up by President Clinton and Prime Minister Hashimoto to bring about structural change in the Japanese economy. I served in that capacity for three years. Together, we engineered the initial restructuring of everything from the laws governing the size of retail stores to the electricity distribution system to the deregulation of telecommunications to the rules of corporate governance. The latter dealt with intricate details such as audit committee composition, the roles of directors and so on. I mention this to underscore only that I know enough about Japanese business practices and ethics so as to be dangerous!\n\nHere is the point: From my personal perspective, the thing to watch in Japan is not whether Mr. Horie is good or bad. Or whether Fujitsu or any other company gets a further contract to improve the capacity of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, as discussed in this morning’s Financial Times. The issue is how the Japanese deal with the situation and what their remedies tell us about their capacity to change and adapt a great and noble society that rose up from the ashes to become the world’s second-largest economy.\n\nThere is a dynamic tension in Japan today. Prime Minister Koizumi has taken on the old political dinosaurs. Young entrepreneurs gathered in the new office buildings in the Roppongi Hills area of Tokyo and elsewhere have challenged the tightly interwoven culture of the old Japanese corporate hierarchy. Foreign investment has positioned itself for a sea change in Japan’s direction.\n\nWe will learn a great deal about whether Japan has made the turn by how they handle Livedoor. If there is even a hint that the old order still has the power to stifle a “Roppongi Hills Tribe” entrepreneur because he dresses funny or is a college dropout or had the nerve to attempt to buy a baseball team or attempt a takeover of Nippon Broadcasting (assuming his tactics were legal and legitimate), then the Japanese authorities may well risk skepticism about their capacity to adapt to the demands of globalization and the creative destruction of the old order. If, on the other hand, they dispatch with the legitimate foibles of Horie or any other business operator in a manner that shows the rule of law, and practice, is geared to encouraging legitimate vehicles for creative destruction along Schumpeterian lines, then we will know that the Japanese are well on their way to joining us in handling “the heat of China's emergence.”",

            "content": "January 6, 2006 Boston, Massachusetts\n\nMany of my fellow Federal Reserve Bank presidents are economists by training and trade. I am not. My academic training culminated in an M.B.A. Before coming to the Dallas Fed, I made my living as an investor in globally diversified equities and distressed debt, and after beating the house for 20 years, I figured I was pressing my luck and cashed in to become a U.S. trade negotiator. I do not mind admitting to some apprehension about speaking to an audience of economists on an economic topic. But I am very comfortable with a subject I consider one of the biggest challenges my colleagues and I must cope with: globalization’s impact on the gearing of the economy and the making of monetary policy.\n\nThe literature on globalization is large. The literature on monetary policy is vast. But the literature examining the combination of the two is surprisingly small.\n\nA search for scholarly articles with the words “globalization” and “monetary” and “policy” turns up 31,500 references. Narrowing your quest to the exact word combination “globalization and monetary policy” produces only 39 citations. Limiting the word combination to the title of an article, you will find just two articles.\n\nTom Friedman’s popular book The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century doesn’t have a single entry on “money,” “monetary policy” or “central banking.” The word “globalization” does not appear in the index of Michael Woodford’s influential Interest and Prices: Foundations of a Theory of Monetary Policy. Nor do the words “international trade” or “international finance.”\n\nWhat gives? Is the process of globalization disconnected from monetary policy? Is central banking totally divorced from globalization?\n\nI think not. I believe globalization and monetary policy are intertwined in a complex narrative that is only beginning to unfold.\n\nLet me tell you of one eye-opening experience. About two years ago, I was in London on business for Kissinger McLarty, where I worked after the U.S. Trade Representative’s office and before joining the Fed. I received a call from the head of Japan’s equivalent of the Business Roundtable, the Keidanren, asking me to pop over to give a couple of speeches. They made an offer I couldn’t refuse, and I said I would be happy to travel to Tokyo if they could schedule the flights. They booked me on Virgin Air and arranged for a car to take me to Heathrow.\n\nAt the appointed time, the car didn’t show up. So I called the number I had been given, and on the other end was a woman with a frightfully British accent. When I asked, “Could you kindly tell me where my car is, ma’am?” she deftly shifted to a Southwestern American accent and said, “Now don’t you worry. It is five minutes away. Ah apologize for the delay. Have a nice flight.”\n\nI said, “Well, hold on a minute. You answered this call in a British accent but once I spoke, you shifted to a Texas accent. Who are you? Where are you?”\n\n“Well,” she answered, “I am a call center operator in Bangalore.”\n\n“Have you ever been to the United States?” I asked.\n\n“Oh, no, sir. But I can tell that you are from Arkansas, Texas or New Mexico.”\n\n“And how do you learn to speak like me?”\n\n“Well, sir, for people like you, we watch a television show called Walker, Texas Ranger.”\n\n“And what if I were from Boston?”\n\n“Ah, for those people we watch Cheers.”\n\nIt may seem a small matter that a Japanese firm employed a worker in India to track a car by GPS in London and mimic a voice from Texas. But globalization impacts the conduct of business so much more profoundly. The expansion of our productive capacity, the pricing mechanism of labor and other inputs, the relationship between inventories and sales—all are being changed by the global spread of capitalism.\n\nWhere does monetary policy come into play in this world?\n\nOne of the first books I read as I prepared for my new job as Dallas Fed president was A Term at the Fed, an excellent little tome written by former Federal Reserve Governor Larry Meyer. It gives you a good sense of the lexicon of monetary policy deliberations. The language of Fedspeak is full of sacrosanct terms such as “output gap” and “capacity constraints” and “the natural rate of unemployment,” known by its successor acronym, “NAIRU,” the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment.\n\nAll of this jargon reflects the fact that central bankers do not wish to strain the economy’s capacity to produce. They want GDP to run at no more than its theoretical limit, for exceeding that limit for long might stoke the fires of inflation. One key capacity factor, for example, is the labor pool. The shibboleth known as the Phillips curve posited that beyond a certain point too much employment would ignite demands for greater pay, with eventual inflationary consequences for the entire economy. The econometric calculations behind the Phillips curve and the panoply of other domestic “capacity constraints” and “output gaps” were based on assumptions of a world that in my opinion exists no more.\n\nMeyer’s book is a real eye-opener because it describes in great detail the learning process of the FOMC members as the U.S. economy morphed into the new economic environment of the second half of the 1990s. At the time, economic growth was strong and accelerating. The unemployment rate was low, approaching levels unseen since the 1960s. The prevailing views of the Phillips curve, capacity constraints, output gaps and the NAIRU pointed to rising inflation. That is precisely what the Federal Reserve’s models were saying, as was Meyer himself, joined by nearly all the other Fed governors and presidents gathered around the FOMC table. Under the circumstances, they concluded that monetary policy needed to be tightened to head off the inevitable.\n\nThey were frustrated by Chairman Greenspan’s insistence on postponing rate hikes, yet perplexed that inflation wasn’t rising. Indeed, it kept falling.\n\nIf the conventional wisdom had prevailed, the Fed would have caused the economy to seriously underperform. According to back-of-the-envelope calculations by economists whom I respect, real GDP would have been lower by several hundred billion dollars. Employment gains would have been reduced by perhaps a million jobs. The costs of not getting these critical calibrations right would have been huge.\n\nHow was Greenspan able to get it right when other very smart men and women did not? Well, we now see with 20/20 hindsight what Greenspan instinctively saw early on—the fact that accelerating productivity had begun to alter the traditional relationships among economic variables.\n\nGreenspan understood the data and the modeling techniques of the Fed’s research staff and other outstanding economists. But he was also constantly talking—and listening—to business leaders. And what they were telling him jibed with what he knew from years of consulting and sitting on corporate boards: They were simply doing their job of seeking any and all means of earning a return for their shareholders. At the time, they were being enabled by new technologies that enhanced productivity. The Information Age had begun rewriting their operations manuals, creating a schism between the efficacy of prevailing theory and real-world practice.\n\nIt is important to listen to our economy’s business operators. We have millions of experienced managers and decisionmakers in the private sector. This may be our greatest competitive advantage, the wellspring for the mighty economic machine that produces some $12 trillion in economic output. Our business managers are the nerve endings in Adam Smith’s invisible hand, stretching the fingers of capitalism into every corner of comparative advantage worldwide. America’s business managers have begun taking advantage of globalization, just as they had previously reaped the gains from inventing new technology and then using it.\n\nConsider labor alone. In the early ’90s, the former Soviet Union released millions of hungry workers into the system. China joined the World Trade Organization at the turn of the century, and 750 million workers came into play. And now India, with more than 100 million English-speaking workers among its 1 billion people, has joined the game. What does all this mean to American managers paid to enhance returns to shareholders by growing revenues at the lowest possible costs? Because labor accounts for, on average, about two-thirds of the cost of producing most goods and services, the managers will go where labor is cheapest. They will have a widget made in China or Vietnam, or a software program written in Russia or Estonia, or a center for processing calls or managing a back office set up in India or the Philippines.\n\nThe destruction of communism and the creation of vast new sources of inputs and production have upset all the calculations and equations of the very best economics minds. How can economists quantify with precision what the United States can produce with existing labor and capital when we do not know the full extent and elasticity of the global labor pool? Or the totality of the financial and intellectual capital that can be drawn on to produce a nation’s GDP? How do we measure the inventory-to-sales ratio in a technologically advanced, hyper-interconnected world where offshore sources are expanding geometrically, if not exponentially?\n\nAs long as we are able to hold back the devil of protectionism and keep open international capital markets and remain an open economy, how can we calculate an “output gap” without knowing the present capacity of, say, the Chinese and Indian economies? How can we fashion a Phillips curve without imputing the behavioral patterns of foreign labor pools? How can we formulate regression analyses to capture what competition from all these new sources does to incentivize American management?\n\nThe old models simply no longer apply in our globalized, interconnected and expanded economy. This is why I think so many economists have been so baffled by the length and strength of the current expansion and the non-inflationary prosperity we have enjoyed over the past almost two decades.\n\nYou could sense something was wrong with the econometric equations if you listened to the troops on the ground, fighting in the trenches of the marketplace. That is what my colleagues and I at the USTR did negotiating market-opening trade rounds with China, Vietnam, Mexico, Brazil and others in the late 1990s. It is what my colleagues and I at Kissinger McLarty did while advising dozens of U.S. companies seeking entry into China, the former Soviet satellites, India and Latin America. It is what my colleagues and I on the FOMC do by making dozens upon dozens of calls every month to CEOs, COOs and CFOs of businesses, large and small. We see managers at work expanding the capacity of our economy, expanding the gap between what their previously limited resources would allow them to produce and what their newly expanded globalized, technologically enhanced reach now allows them to produce.\n\nFrom this, I conclude that the economics profession needs to rejigger its econometric equations to better inform our understanding of the maximum sustainable levels of U.S. production and growth.\n\nYes, Globalization Matters\nThere are, of course, those who will argue, at least from a theoretical perspective, that globalization should not matter much in a world of flexible exchange rates. They contend that a central bank can tailor monetary policy to domestic objectives alone when it is not obliged to defend a specific value for the currency.\n\nThis proposition, which goes back to John Maynard Keynes, has been taught in economics classes for 50 years or more. Indeed, it was the basis for much of the theoretical economics I was taught as a Harvard undergraduate 37 years ago. The proposition, however, holds only under assumptions I do not think apply in the world we live in today. The theory, for example, requires that capital be completely mobile, equalizing interest rates around the world, and that domestic prices be free from distortions, regulation, trade barriers and the like.\n\nCapital is indeed more mobile than it was 40 years ago, but not completely so. Economies are still far from free of government meddling that distorts the market’s price-setting function. You need look no further than the European Union’s agricultural policies. The greater the distortion, the higher the inflation. As excess regulations and barriers are eliminated, the central bank's incentives will change and inflation will fall. Kenneth Rogoff made this argument a couple of years ago to explain how globalization has been largely responsible for the worldwide decline in inflation over the past 10 to 15 years.\n\nAs good economists, you might protest that liberalized trade policies, the impact of new economic entrants and the like are one-time shocks, unlikely to produce a sustained decline in inflation. In the real world, though, these changes take time to work themselves through the economy. An analogy is the deregulation of banks and airlines in the late 1970s, both supposedly one-off events. Who would argue that these companies aren’t still adjusting to these “one-time shocks”? When I helped negotiate China into the World Trade Organization, a process that was not completed until the start of the Bush “43” administration, I knew my yet-to-be-born grandchildren would be dealing with the tail end of the changes wrought by China’s entry into the global marketplace.\n\nGlobalization still has a long way to go. It will prompt a long-term sequence of changes in the United States and around the world. Its impact has a half-life of at least a dozen years—if I can borrow a term from nuclear physics, a subject about which I know even less than I know about theoretical economics.\n\nTo be sure, not everyone buys into my proposition about how globalization impacts worldwide inflation. Even so, as a practical matter, globalization has important implications for monetary policymakers, flexible exchange rates or no. We actually ponder the depths and resilience of Chinese capacity, for example, when we sit around the table of the FOMC. Our understanding of how the economy operates depends on the behavior of economic actors and forces that are new and different in a world of increasing globalization.\n\nIt is a world of intense competition, and that creates incentives to raise productivity as well as the means to do so. In the past decade, the U.S. economy’s average annual increase in output per hour has been 2.7 percent, just about equal to the extraordinary quarter-century boom that followed World War II. My business contacts talk and act as if the globalization now under way will bring another decade of hypercompetition. This global hothouse will enable, perhaps even force, businesses to keep productivity growth in the range we have enjoyed since the mid-1990s, hopefully for many years to come. If productivity growth can stay near 3 percent, monetary policy can accommodate relatively faster growth without igniting inflation.\n\nI like to say money is the economy’s lifeblood. The Federal Reserve’s great responsibility is to maintain the cardiovascular system of American capitalism. The Fed’s operations—from processing payments to regulating banks to trading foreign exchange to setting the federal funds rate—keep open the arteries, veins and capillaries of capitalism. A healthy cardiovascular system enables the brain and propels the muscles of production. The quality of the money supply is critical to economic success, as is the quantity.\n\nYou cannot have the dynamic progress Tom Friedman describes in his book without the well-functioning, reliable monetary regimes central banks have been sustaining. It is an especially intense responsibility for the Federal Reserve, as the primus inter pares central bank, serving the largest economy in the world and circulating the world’s most utilized currency. One cannot make monetary policy at the Federal Reserve without being cognizant of the forces of globalization acting upon our economy. Nor can one be oblivious to the need to conduct our policy with an awareness of how our actions impact markets and, therefore, economic potential worldwide.\n\nKeeping inflation in check is a central bank’s sacred mission. By spurring productivity and fomenting tectonic economic changes, globalization has acted as a tailwind for the Fed’s—and other central banks’—efforts to hold down inflation. I believe the Federal Reserve has been able to contain inflation with faster growth than would have been possible in the absence of globalization. In short, globalization has made the Fed’s job easier over the past few years.\n\nWill the tailwinds stay with us?\n\nLeft to their own devices, I think they would remain for a significant time, but we have to take into account the political dimension. I have expressed my concern about the implications of our fiscal deficits, vowing never to use my vote on the FOMC to monetize excess spending. I have also warned of the dangers of protectionism, which would undercut globalization’s favorable impact on inflation. Deficits and protectionism could lead to interest rates higher than they would otherwise need to be in order to maintain low inflation.\n\nAs a Texan, I am mindful of the story about William McChesney Martin, Fed chairman from 1951 to 1970. President Johnson invited him down to his Texas ranch for what turned out to be a one-on-one meeting. The president wanted a more accommodating monetary policy, and Martin, a strong advocate of Fed independence, tried to explain to him the consequences of that course of action. Johnson would have none of it and advanced on Martin, shoving him around the room and shouting, “Boys dying in Vietnam, and Bill Martin doesn’t care!” Years later, Martin expressed his regrets about shifting policy to suit the president. “To my everlasting shame,” he said, “I finally gave in to him.”[1]\n\nPresidents Clinton and Bush have allowed the Fed to operate with a high degree of political independence from the administration. On the whole, Congress has also wisely refrained from interference. Without its independence from political interference, I doubt the Fed could have so successfully set the interest rates that have led to today’s favorable economic circumstances. Just as I doubt that, without independence from rigid econometric dicta, monetary policy could have so adroitly harnessed, and in turn lubricated, the forces of globalization.",
