            "content": "Remarks as prepared for delivery.\n\nGood morning.\n\nIt’s great to be in New York again and to have the opportunity to speak with you about the economy and monetary policy.  I very much appreciate the invitation, and I look forward to a lively discussion.\n\nNow, instead of starting with monetary policy, I’m going to begin with a story.\n\nLast week, I was walking in my neighborhood.  A young father, with a stroller, a toddler, and a dog called out to me.  He had a question.  “President Daly, are you declaring victory?”\n\nI immediately said no. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) won’t be satisfied until inflation is at our 2 percent goal.\n\nBut as it turns out, that wasn’t what he meant.\n\nWhat he wanted to know was that we wouldn’t stop there.  He wanted low inflation, a healthy labor market, and a durable expansion.  He wanted a chance to catch up and then advance.  A chance to recoup what high inflation took from him. And an opportunity to build his career, family, and community.  An opportunity to be better off.\n\nAs a policymaker, that has always been my objective—to deliver the foundations for that type of economy.  And with inflation easing and the economy back on a sustainable track, that objective can be our focus.\n\nToday, I will discuss the progress we’ve made in bringing inflation down and the importance of looking beyond a “soft landing.”  Aspiring to a durable expansion with sustained price stability.\n\nBefore I go on, let me remind you that the views I express are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nLet me start with where we are right now. The economy is clearly in a better place. Inflation has fallen substantially, and the labor market has returned to a more sustainable path. And the risks to our goals are now balanced. This is significant improvement from just two years ago.\n\nOf course, as conditions improve, policy needs to adjust.\n\nSo, the FOMC needed to recalibrate, and did so at the September meeting. I see this recalibration as “right-sizing,” recognizing the progress we’ve made and loosening the policy reins a bit, but not letting go. Even with this adjustment, policy remains restrictive, exerting additional downward pressure on inflation to ensure it reaches 2 percent.\n\nMaking these adjustments to match the economy we have is crucial. It prevents the mistake of over-tightening and ensures we are supporting both of our goals.\n\nContinued progress is not guaranteed. We must stay vigilant and be intentional, continually assessing the economy and balancing both of our mandated objectives: fully delivering on 2 percent inflation while ensuring that the labor market remains in line with full employment.\n\nThat is a soft landing.\n\nBut as the dad in my neighborhood reminded us, this is only part of what people need. What households, businesses, and communities really want is a durable economy, with sustained growth, a good labor market, and low inflation.\n\nAnd all of this helps communities, which depend on households and businesses to thrive.\n\nSo, is a durable expansion possible?\n\nHistory says yes.\n\nAgain, the data tell the story (Figure 2). Compared to recent history, the current expansion is still relatively young.\n\nThe bottom line: sustained expansion helps all Americans.\n\nIn the coming months and years, there will almost certainly be economic bumps, disturbances, and scares. And the Federal Reserve cannot fully prevent shocks from having an impact. But barring such events, and with the right monetary policy mix, we can help create the conditions for enduring growth.\n\nThe most important trait in a central banker is the ability to look ahead. To keep an eye on today and an eye on tomorrow.\n\nThe work to achieve a soft landing is not fully done. And we are resolute to finish that job.\n\nBut that cannot be all we’re after.\n\nUltimately, we must strive for a world where people aren’t worried about inflation or the economy. A world where people have time to catch up, and then to get ahead.\n\nThat, as I told the young father, is my version of victory. And that’s when I will consider the job truly done."

            "content": "Remarks as prepared for delivery.\n\nThank you, Alex for that kind introduction. And thank you to the Commonwealth Club World Affairs of California and the San Francisco Press Club for hosting this event. I’m really looking forward to a lively discussion.\n\nNow, the last time I was here, the world looked considerably different. It was November 2021, and we were still struggling to come out of the pandemic. Inflation was high, the labor market was rebounding, and the federal funds rate, the Federal Reserve’s primary interest rate tool, was near zero.\n\nThings have clearly changed. The federal funds rate is now above 5 percent, inflation has receded, although not completely, and the labor market has more than recovered and is now slowly moving towards a more sustainable level.\n\nThat’s a lot of improvement and we should acknowledge it. But we are not there yet. So, we must continue the work of fully restoring price stability without a painful disruption to the economy.\n\nAs always, the views I will express are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nSo, where are we? Well, we are still in the fight to bring inflation to our 2 percent target. We’ve made a lot of progress, but there is still work to do.\n\nIn other words, so far, so good. Both supply and demand have contributed to the decline in inflation. And progress has come without a significant disruption to the labor market.\n\nMonetary policy is working, but we need to finish the job.\n\nAnd this will take balance.\n\nAnd we can’t count on all the supply factors that helped us last year. Now that supply chains are largely mended, and domestic labor force participation has fully recovered, we are unlikely to get as much help from those forces. We have to remain open to positive supply developments, but increasingly, restrained demand, rather than improved supply, will likely be needed to get inflation down to target.\n\nAnd that brings the labor market into the conversation. As I showed earlier, so far, the labor market has adjusted slowly, and the unemployment rate has only edged up. But we are getting nearer to a point where that benign outcome could be less likely.\n\nAlthough job growth remains strong, most other measures of labor market conditions have returned to their pre-pandemic levels. In particular, the balance between the demand and supply of workers has largely normalized.\n\nLooking at the top of the red dots, you can see that in the aftermath of pandemic lockdowns, firms posted historically large numbers of job vacancies. Firms were scrambling, if you remember, trying to manage hiring and turnover to meet ever-surging consumer demand. Vacancies rose rapidly, firms chased a limited pool of workers, and the labor market felt frenzied. In Beveridge curve terms, we moved up the steep portion of the curve.\n\nAll this is to say that at this point, inflation is not the only risk we face. We will need to keep our eyes on both sides of our mandate—inflation and full employment—as we work to achieve our goals.\n\nSo, what does this mean for policy? Simply put, we need to be vigilant and open.\n\nWe have two goals, one tool, and a lot of uncertainty. So, being definitive and predetermined is not that helpful.\n\nWhat is helpful, is planning. Evaluating scenarios that could play out and understanding how policy should respond.\n\nIn other words, to be appropriate, policy has to be conditional. And we have to think in scenarios.\n\nFor example, if inflation turns out to fall more slowly than projected, then holding the federal funds rate higher for longer would be appropriate. If instead, inflation falls rapidly, or the labor market softens more than expected, then lowering the policy rate would be necessary. Finally, if we continue to see gradual declines in inflation and a slow rebalancing in the labor market, then we can normalize policy over time, as many expect.\n\nThe truth is any of these scenarios are in the realm of reasonable—they are all possible.\n\nAnd we need to be ready to respond to however the economy evolves.\n\nLet me end where I started. This is not 2021, or 2022, or even 2023. We are in a very different place. Inflation has come down, the labor market is solid, and businesses and households believe that we can finish the job.\n\nBut we’re not there yet.\n\nWhether you call it the final mile, completing the work, or simply delivering fully on our dual mandate goals, there is more to do.\n\nBut we will need to exhibit care. To really thrive, people need both price stability and jobs.\n\nThe Volcker disinflation remedied that. But the medicine was harsh. And my family, and millions of other American families, went from being constrained by high inflation to hampered by job loss.\n\nLooking back, that medicine seemed necessary, reflecting the specific circumstances of the time.\n\nAll of this means that our journey today can be different. Not just avoiding a painful recession, but balancing policy to protect full employment while restoring price stability.\n\nThat is the economy we are striving for, and that is the one we are working to deliver."

            "content": "Remarks as prepared for delivery.\n\nThank you for your kind introduction.  And thank you, Father Fitzgerald, for the invitation to speak here today.  It is truly my honor.\n\nNow before I begin, I want to ask, how many of you missed your high school graduation ceremony because of the pandemic?  Raise your hands.\n\nI see a lot of hands.\n\nSo, the very first thing I want you to do is to take a moment to really appreciate that you’re here now, in person, celebrating what you have achieved.  You are resilient, and we are so proud of you.\n\nAnd to all the family, friends, faculty, and everyone else who helped make this day possible.  Thank you.  You have done an amazing service for us all.\n\nToday, I’d like to share two stories.  Actually, one story told two ways.\n\nHere is version 1.\n\nWhen I was 15, I dropped out of high school to help support my family.  I had odd jobs, and my goal was to be a bus driver, because it came with union wages and good benefits.  But I got lucky.  I met a mentor, and she encouraged me to think bigger.  To get a GED and go to college.  So, I did.  I got a degree in economics and philosophy and went on to get a Ph.D.  In 1996, I got a job as a staff economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.  Now, 28 years later, I’m standing in front of you as President and CEO of that very institution.\n\nThat story is true.  It’s meaningful.  And it’s comfortable.\n\nIt’s also incomplete.\n\nSo, let me try again.  And give you version 2.\n\nWhen I was 15, my family stumbled.  My siblings moved in with my grandparents and I moved in with friends.  I left high school and got a job—three, actually.  I drove a donut truck, worked at a deli, and worked at a Target.  I wanted to be a bus driver so I could have one job instead of three.\n\nI was struggling.\n\nSo, a friend introduced me to a woman named Betsy.  Betsy was kind and practical.  She encouraged me to get a GED.  As it turns out, you can’t be a bus driver without one.\n\nSo, I said yes.\n\nBut when I went to take the test, I was nervous, terrified really.  I kept sweating on my test paper and breaking my pencil lead.\n\nAll I could think about was failing.  Disappointing Betsy.  Not being a bus driver.  Not being anything close to a success.\n\nI wanted to quit, leave the test.  Fortunately, I didn’t.\n\nNow, I’d like to tell you that with age and experience, fears of failing, disappointing, and changing course go away.  But that’s not how life works.\n\nAfter college, I went straight to graduate school, at the University of Illinois.  I didn’t even think, I just went.  I’d graduated at the top of my economics class and it seemed expected, natural.  But after a year, I felt unsure.  Unsure if I wanted a Ph.D.  Unsure if I wanted to be an economist.  Unsure if I wanted to be a researcher.\n\nEvery day, I thought about changing.  Switching programs, getting a job, doing anything different than what I’d signed up for.  Starting again.\n\nBut the stakes seemed high.\n\nAfter all, the University of Illinois was Betsy’s alma mater.  My undergraduate economics professors were so proud that I had followed in their footsteps to get a Ph.D.  And my friends seemed confident, on track, and on their way to success.\n\nChanging my mind, changing course, felt weighty, irreversible, definitely like going backwards.\n\nBut I pivoted anyway.\n\nI moved to Chicago.  I went to work for a theater and a dance company.  I did accounting, business, and even some prop and set design.  I loved it.\n\nThen about a year into my new life, I realized it wasn’t perfect.  I missed economics.  I missed research and working with others to solve hard problems.  I missed gathering evidence and evaluating it to inform policy.  I missed everything.  Because economics, as it turned out, was my calling, my vocation.  And I wanted to go back.\n\nBut that’s where things got really hard.  I needed help.  And I needed it from the very same people, professors, who had helped me the first time.\n\nMy heart pounded as I dialed the phone.  Gene Wagner, my undergraduate professor and mentor, answered.  I immediately blurted out my news, stumbled through my explanation, apologized, twice, and then I waited.\n\nI heard the rumbling of his voice before he shouted, and then it came: “Jane, come to the phone, Mary wants be an economist!”\n\nYou can imagine how I felt.\n\nNow, we spent the next hour talking, me, Gene, and his wife Jane.  He told me that when he was finding his path, he felt unsure too.\n\nHe never thought he could get a Ph.D.  He worked construction, came from a working-class family, and the whole idea felt foreign.  But he loved being an economist; loved the direct connection to people and to practice.  Every day he went to work he felt joy, and he knew I would feel the same.\n\nThat day, my professor, and someone I admired, told me version 2 of his story, and it changed me.\n\nThat’s why on this day, your graduation, I’m sharing version 2 of my story with you.\n\nTo tell you that I’ve been unsure, changed my mind, and thought I couldn’t do it.\n\nBut I have done it.   And so can you.\n\nThe truth is, no one gets to where they are smoothly.  Everyone detours, doubts, and pivots.  That is human and part of finding your way.\n\nIt can be hard to know this when you are right in it.  It can feel like friends are surging forward, and you are falling behind.\n\nBut that’s just noise.\n\nYour job as you move forward in your journey, is to acknowledge the fears, and the uncertainty, and then listen.\n\nWe all have a voice inside of ourselves telling us what’s next.  The challenge is to hear it and then be brave enough to follow its guidance.\n\nBecause in the end, there are no crooked paths, only your path.  So, be yourself.  Find your own way.  And be proud of your version 2.\n\nThat’s the story, your story, that will change lives and change worlds.\n\nYou are ready.  And we are all looking forward to what you will do.\n\nCongratulations, Class of 2024!"

            "content": "Remarks as prepared for delivery.\n\nGood morning.  Thank you, Laura for that kind introduction.  And thank you to all of you in the audience who do such important work for families, communities, and the economy.  It is my distinct honor to be here and I look forward to our conversation.\n\nBut before we turn to our dialogue, I thought I would offer some opening remarks.\n\nAffordable housing shortages are not new.  What’s different today is how many people are affected—a large and growing number, more than at any other time in our living history.\n\nYou don’t have to go too far to see this.  As people regularly in the field, this is your day to day.  In our travels at the San Francisco Fed, we find it everywhere.  In communities that have struggled for decades, like urban centers and rural areas, to ones newer to the issues like Boise, Idaho, Salt Lake City, Phoenix, Las Vegas, the list goes on.\n\nThis culminates in the sentiment that housing is broken.  That it’s falling short of our collective expectations, not only to provide shelter, but also to support growth, community, and an economy that works for all.\n\nToday, I will discuss how we got here, and what it will take to change the equation.  My message is clear: collective problems require collective efforts, and it will take all of us—community development, nonprofits, government, and business—working together to achieve greater access to housing.\n\nBut before I get started, let me remind you that the remarks I make today are mine and do not necessarily reflect the views of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nLong-standing, Worse Now\n\nSo, why are so many Americans worried about housing costs?  The affordability data tell the story.  The figure (Figure 1) shows median home values relative to median family income for the past six decades.  This calculation allows us to track affordability without undue influence of interest rates or business cycles.\n\nAnd this is the root of our problem.  With so few homes available to meet demand, the value of homes has soared.\n\nEveryone’s Problem\n\nThis point was brought home to me during a visit to Orange County, California.  I was meeting with a group of local restaurant owners.  We were talking about the challenges of finding and keeping workers.  When I asked about housing, the room changed.  Everyone had stories of loss.  Loss of longtime employees who couldn’t afford the ever-increasing commute distances, loss of interested applicants who departed when they found out the cost of housing, and loss of opportunities to serve their customers and grow their businesses due to lack of staff.  To them, housing was failing, and no one was winning.\n\nGetting Our Housing in Order\n\nSo, what should we do?\n\nAs I said, collective problems call for collective solutions.  So, we will all have to participate.\n\nLet’s first start with what the Fed can do.\n\nOf course, I recognize that higher interest rates also raise housing costs.  But these adjustments are temporary and needed to bring down inflation.  History has taught us that price stability is the single best mechanism to ensure sustainable growth.  Without this condition, the economy, the labor market, and the housing market all falter.  That is why we are committed to finishing the job.\n\nUltimately, however, the tools of the Fed are limited.  We can create the economic conditions for housing, but our efforts will not be sufficient to rebalance the housing equation.  This will require other important players in the economy.\n\nFortunately, many have already taken up the charge.  Governments, businesses, and communities are recognizing the problems, forging partnerships, and creating solutions.  Often taking on third rails of policy to do it.\n\nFinally, there are communities, the ones you’ve been working with for decades.  They’re expanding their partner networks and building alliances across a wide range of sectors including public, private, and nonprofit.  With this new breadth of partners comes the potential for new scale.\n\nI see the fact that governments, businesses, and communities are joining with all of you as the type of focus and scale we need to change the equation on housing.  The problems have gotten bigger than any single action.  And none of us will be as strong alone. Good work done independently is good.  Good work done together is great.\n\nHome Truths\n\nIn the end, what we are really talking about is not housing, it’s home.\n\nThe dignity people deserve is a place to call their own and the freedom to choose it.  When these things are constrained, lives are affected.\n\nA few years back, I was driving from Boise, Idaho, to Twin Falls.  I pulled into a highway gas station and found myself in a conversation with a young couple moving across the state.  They were ready, but not excited.  They told me they had to move.  They were expecting a new baby and could no longer afford to live where they had grown up.  So, they were venturing away from home and family for more affordable housing.\n\nThey will likely make it.  Forge a new path.  But is this what we really want?\n\nThat’s the conversation we need to have about housing.\n\nAnd you are the people to carry this forward.\n\nThank you.\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n\nCollinson, Robert, John Eric Humphries, Nicholas Mader, Davin Reed, Daniel Tannenbaum, and Winnie van Dijk. 2024. “Eviction and Poverty in American Cities.” Quarterly Journal of Economics 139(1, February), pp. 57–120.\n\nPlantinga, Andrew, Cécile Détang-Dessendre, Gary Hunt, and Virginie Piguet. 2013. “Housing Prices and Inter-Urban Migration.” Regional Science and Urban Economics 43(2, March), pp. 296-306.\n\nPribesh, Shana, and Douglas B.

            "content": "Remarks as prepared for delivery.\n\nThe day after the December Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, just a few months back, a man came up to me in the dry cleaner.  He told me that he and his wife had gone to dinner the night before, partly to celebrate the end of the Fed’s rate tightening cycle, but mostly to mark the end of the long, hard battle to bring inflation down.  He felt the worst was behind us, and that he and his family could finally take a breath.\n\nThe relief he described is not unique.  I hear it everywhere.  Businesses, communities, and families exhaling, just a bit, as they see inflation falling without the economy breaking.\n\nThere is no doubt things are better. But progress is not victory, and we, the FOMC, need to deliver more than a few fleeting moments of relief.\n\nOur goals are sustainable price stability and full employment, working together in a balance that will last.  There is more work to do to deliver on that commitment.\n\nToday, I will discuss the progress we have made, the risks we face, and what we will need to do to finish the job.\n\nAs always, let me remind you that the views I express are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nSignificant Progress\n\nSo, let’s start with progress.  Relative to a year ago, the economy is in a very good place.  Inflation is heading down, the labor market is rebalancing, and many of the post-pandemic disruptions are dissipating.\n\nThese things aren’t surprising.  They’ve just finally happened.  And they’ve helped ease goods price inflation substantially, bringing it back to near pre-pandemic levels.\n\nBut perhaps the best news about the decline in inflation is that supply wasn’t the only story.  Improvement also has come from a gradual slowing in demand, the portion that monetary policy directly affects.\n\nPutting all of this together, it is clear that things changed in 2023.  Supply bounced back, tighter monetary policy gained traction, and inflation came down rapidly.  For households and businesses, the treadmill of persistently high and rising inflation slowed down.  All without a significant decline in growth or employment.\n\nThis is unequivocally good news, and real progress.\n\nMinding the Risks\n\nOf course, projections and expectations are just that: views about what we think will happen. We need more time and data to be sure that they will be realized.  And we need to monitor risks that could get in the way, especially since uncertainty is so high.\n\nThere is a myriad of risks to consider, but I will focus on two: slower inflation progress and fragilities in the labor market.\n\nThe same is true of productivity growth.  It’s highly uncertain whether we will continue to see the strong numbers of last year.  There are many reasons to be optimistic, but productivity trends are notoriously hard to forecast, and at this point, we just can’t be sure.\n\nOn the demand side, momentum remains a risk, especially among consumers.  We’ve repeatedly expected spending to slow, only to be wrong.  Ongoing economic momentum that outstrips available supply remains a risk to the inflation outlook.\n\nBut slower progress on inflation is not the only risk we face.  On the other side of our mandate, the labor market could falter.\n\nOf course, with employment growth as strong as it has been, this seems like a distant risk. But given the speed at which labor market pivots historically occur, it’s a risk we must keep in mind.\n\nFinishing the Job\n\nSo that’s the landscape.  The economy is healthy.  Price stability is within sight.  But there is more work to do.\n\nTo finish the job will take fortitude.  We will need to resist the temptation to act quickly when patience is needed and be prepared to respond agilely as the economy evolves.\n\nThis is not a new situation for the Fed or any central bank. Uncertainty is a fact of life. The economy rarely signals exactly where it is headed.\n\nThe constant in our changing environment is our goals.  They are always sustainable price stability and full employment for a healthy economy.\n\nAnd these are more than just words, a fact I’m reminded of nearly every day.\n\nAfter the dry cleaner last December, I went to the hardware store.  I was standing in line behind a dad and his college-age daughter.  When the total rang up, the dad asked the cashier why it was so high.  Without hesitation, the cashier said, inflation—everything costs more.\n\nAs the two walked out of the store, the daughter said, “I never heard about inflation before the pandemic.”  Her dad responded, “I hope you never do again.”\n\nThat is really what we are after. An economy unburdened by inflation, where people can step off the treadmill and make decisions about their lives and livelihoods without worrying about rapidly changing prices. We want price stability built to last.\n\nThank you.\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences"

            "content": "Remarks as prepared for delivery.\n\nIntroduction\n\nBernanke noted, that when central bankers know about where the economy is headed or face imminent risks, they should adjust policy decisively and aggressively—what he called the “cold turkey” approach. He then noted, that in almost every other instance, more caution is warranted. When central banks are unsure about how the economy will evolve; when they are unsure of the impact their policies will have; or when they are uncertain about how the fundamental benchmarks in the economy are changing, the optimal strategy is to look before leaping—to take a “gradualist” approach to policy.\n\nI reference this speech and its lessons to remind us that the economy has always been dynamic. Change is inevitable, and uncertainty is a fact of life.\n\nBut monetary policy can adjust. Going quickly when conditions demand and more slowly when the road is less clear. Our tools, strategies, and actions can always meet the moment. The choice, of course, is ours.\n\nNow before I go much further, I would like to remind you that the views I express today are my own, and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues or anyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\n\nA World in Flux\n\nSo, what do we face? As many at this conference have noted, we are in a period when the risks seem high and the waters, murky.\n\nCentral banks also face these challenges, as well as a policy landscape that has shifted significantly in the past four years.\n\nPolicy for the Moment\n\nThat is a lot of change in a short period. So it is somewhat surprising that Ben Bernanke’s remarks have been so durable.\n\nBut remember, his key point was that monetary policy is flexible, and it can adjust as conditions change. And that is an important lesson for today.\n\nBut most times we face are not so clear. And a different type of boldness is required: the boldness to wait.\n\nIn this moment, we are grappling with all of these situations. At the Federal Reserve, we are not certain whether inflation is on track to return to 2 percent.  We are unsure about the length of policy lags and whether they are behind us or still to be fully realized. And we are uncertain about whether the dynamics we observe today are cyclical remnants of the post-pandemic recovery or indicators of structural shifts and a new normal for the national and global economy.\n\nThe truth is none of these are knowable right now. And the perils of deciding too quickly when we are not sure are real. Declaring certainty without knowing is not just a missed forecast. It’s a policy mistake. And it has the potential to leave a lasting imprint on the economy and negatively affect those we serve.\n\nCall to Action\n\nSo here is the main message of my remarks.\n\nUncertainty is a fact of life, but it does not leave us rudderless. We have the tools and the experience to navigate whatever comes our way.\n\nOur challenge will be what it has always been. To respond rapidly when the situation requires, and to resist the pressure to act quickly when patience is needed. To have the will to make these choices, that is the policymakers’ job.\n\nAnd we need to be collectively up to the task.\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n\nBernanke, Ben S. 2022. “Commentary: Nobel Winner Bernanke: Why the Fed Didn’t Act Faster to Rein In Inflation.” Barron’s, October 22.\n\nBrainard, William C. 1967. “Uncertainty and the Effectiveness of Policy.” American Economic Review: Papers and Proceedings 57(2), pp. 411–425.\n\nGoodfriend, Marvin, and Robert G.

            "content": "Remarks as prepared for delivery.\n\nGood afternoon. It’s terrific to be here and be speaking once again to the Economic Club of New York. So, thank you very much for the invitation, and I look forward to a great discussion.\n\nBefore we get started, I would like to take a few minutes to describe how I see the current economic environment and the uncertainties and tradeoffs we face as we calibrate policy. The key takeaway is that the moment calls for optionality. We must keep our minds open so that we can respond to conditions as they evolve. Vigilance and agility are paramount to finishing the job—the job being, of course, to restore price stability as gently as we can.\n\nThe good news is—at this point—we have time to get it right. The economy and policy are in a much better place. Growth and inflation are gradually slowing and the risks to the outlook are largely balanced. Monetary policy is restrictive and financial conditions are tight. So, we don’t have to rush to any decisions.\n\nBut progress isn’t victory. And we must remain resolute to finish the job. A gradual return to 2 percent inflation is in our sights, but it is not yet in our grasp. That is the final mile.\n\nBut before I go further, let me say that the views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues or anyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\n\nProgress to Date\n\nI mentioned that the economy and policy are in a better place. So, let me begin by taking stock of where we have been and how far we have come.\n\nThis is unequivocally good news. But to ensure that we fully achieve the outcomes we want—sustainable price stability and a healthy and balanced labor market—we need to finish the job.\n\nSo, what will this require?\n\nA Balanced Approach\n\nVigilance and agility.\n\nLet’s start with vigilance. We need to be vigilant in assessing the odds that the good data we’ve been seeing is a new trend, rather than just a temporary relief that will stall out too early, leaving us short of our goals. Either is possible.\n\nI’ve discussed the recent positive data and the progress we’ve made. But why might these positive developments plateau? Put simply, the economy still has considerable momentum and a ways to go to come back into balance.\n\nWhat does this mean for policy? Well, this is where agility comes in. We need to be positioned and prepared for however the economy evolves. We need to have options.\n\nLikewise, if financial conditions, which have tightened considerably in the past 90 days, remain tight, the need for us to take further action is diminished.\n\nIn contrast, if the deceleration of growth and inflation stalls, activity begins to reaccelerate, or financial conditions loosen too much, we can react to those data and raise rates further until we are confident that monetary policy is sufficiently restrictive to complete the job.\n\nIn other words, rather than a prejudged path of what policy will be, we need an open mind and optionality.\n\nThe Final Mile\n\nWhen I travel around my District and across the nation, I see the progress we’ve made in the past year. And that is worth acknowledging.\n\nBut as I said at the start, progress alone is not victory. And it will take vigilance and agility to complete the final mile.\n\nThank you.\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n\n"

            "content": "Remarks as prepared for delivery.\n\nThank you, Dean Goldman, for your kind introduction. It is truly my honor to be here.\n\nFirst things first. I would like all the graduates—and only the graduates—to give yourselves a big round of applause. You have earned this day. And it’s important that you take the time to recognize it.\n\nI also want to acknowledge the family, friends, faculty, and everyone else who, in ways big and small, helped make this day possible. Thank you.\n\nThis day is especially meaningful to me because I also graduated from a public policy school: The Maxwell School at Syracuse University. While the colors of our gowns are different, and a few decades separate my graduating class from yours, we are bound by a commitment to mission-minded work and public service.\n\nOf course, when people hear “public service,” they think either of the president of the United States or the DMV. But we know the label is bigger than that.\n\nIn fact, it’s not a label at all. It’s a choice.\n\nI first learned about this choice decades ago in Ballwin, Missouri. A high school guidance counselor made a phone call. She asked her friend, Betsy, to meet with a former student: a young teenager who had done well in school, read a lot, loved to learn. But the family finances, and the family itself, had fallen on hard times. And the teenager, needing to help out, had dropped out of school. She was working a bunch of different jobs—driving a donut truck, stocking shelves at Target, mowing lawns—whatever she could find. And her goal was to one day get a job as a bus driver so she could have a stable income and good benefits.\n\nBetsy agreed to meet her. And right away she could see that the young woman had a plan. But Betsy knew that, for the plan to work, this young woman needed a GED. So, she suggested it, and the girl took her advice. Then, Betsy told her she would have even more opportunities if she went to college, at least for a little while. The young woman applied and she got in. But she couldn’t afford the tuition. So, Betsy wrote a check—they still had those then—to the bursar at the University of Missouri—St. Louis. And at that moment, everything changed. A semester of college turned into a BA from the University of Missouri—Kansas City, and eventually into a PhD from Syracuse University in economics and public policy.\n\nAnd that path led me here. Yes, that young woman was me. I went from a teenager hoping to be a bus driver to president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. And the reason was Betsy.\n\nBetsy wasn’t a public servant in the traditional sense. And she certainly didn’t see herself that way. But that’s exactly what she was. That’s exactly who she was. And it was not because of a job or a title. It was her lens on the world.\n\nBetsy could see beyond what was right in front of her. In front of her was a teenaged dropout struggling to make ends meet. Betsy saw a young woman full of promise who had simply fallen on hard times.\n\nAnd her seeing changed my life. It is the reason I am here today.\n\nThat is service.\n\nBut seeing a person right in front of you is one thing. Seeing millions whose names and faces you will never know is quite another. Every step you take up the career ladder puts you farther away from the people you serve. And that distance makes it easy to lose sight of what really matters.\n\nIt took a charged moment to bring this point home for me. And it was the most meaningful moment in my thirty-plus year career. It came in 2009, in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis. I was part of the San Francisco Fed Research team and we were briefing the Bank’s then-president Janet Yellen—Treasury Secretary now, of course.\n\nColleagues were describing the ongoing challenges in the labor market, which included near double-digit unemployment, lack of job growth, and a dismal forecast for recovery.\n\nJanet asked a simple question. What would the impact be? The answer was immediate, almost reflexive—the labor market will eventually come back.\n\nBut eventually was beside the point, and Janet instinctively reacted. She struck the table with her fist and said, “These are people!” Except there was a bleep before “people.” In the Midwest, we would say “friggin.” But let’s just say, Janet Yellen is not from the Midwest.\n\nBoth the expletive and the fist pound were startling. And for a moment we all fell silent. Janet had just laid bare the truth about our work. It was not simply theoretical. Behind our data, our models, our forecasts lived people—individuals who had lost jobs, homes, sometimes hope. And we had missed it.\n\nThe moment passed and we returned to the briefing. But I couldn’t stop thinking about it. And I have never forgotten it.\n\nAs a Reserve Bank president, I have tens of millions of constituents. And it’s not enough to look at the data and think I know them. Real knowing comes from seeing the who behind the statistics. And how our policy decisions affect their everyday lives.\n\nThat’s what Janet Yellen’s pound of the fist really meant.\n\nIt was a call for us to see.\n\nNow, this practice of seeing, done day after day, changes not just what we see, but also what we do.\n\nA vivid example of this occurred early in my research career. We were studying the impact of environmental programs. One of the study sites was a village that had a tree planting program to prevent soil erosion and offer shade. And we had gone to check on it.\n\nWhen we arrived at the village, the results of the program were painfully clear: every single tree was dead. A sea of perfectly planted, completely lifeless sticks in the ground.\n\nThe program workers were devastated. But it was obvious what had happened. The trees hadn’t gotten enough water, and they died.\n\nSo, we went to speak to the villagers. We learned that it was a two-mile walk to the well and back—a trip they already made multiple times a day to get water for cooking, drinking, and bathing. When we heard that, we understood. Of course the trees had died. We had given hard-to-care-for trees to people with limited access to water.\n\nIt was a tragic but classic policy miss: providing a well-intentioned solution without ever speaking to the recipients and seeing what they needed.\n\nAnd this is why seeing is so important. When we don’t see things clearly, we don’t do things well, no matter how good our intentions.\n\nWe end up with a sea of dead sticks.\n\nI share these three stories with you because they capture a powerful truth. When we see things clearly, we do things differently.\n\nWe develop programs that give people what they actually need.\n\nWe acknowledge the real-life struggles that numbers don’t show.\n\nWe write the check for a struggling teenager that changes the course of her life.\n\nSo, as you go out into the world, remember this: Public service is not a job. It’s a choice—a choice to see people clearly and to act on what you see.\n\nAnd if you make this choice, no matter where your career takes you—a courtroom, a classroom, a boardroom, or the Situation Room—you will be a public servant.\n\nThat is my call to you.\n\nCongratulations, Class of 2023. And welcome to the fold.\n\nThank you."

            "content": "Remarks as prepared for delivery.\n\nGood morning. It’s great to be here in Utah. I am especially delighted to be with all of you at the Salt Lake Chamber, this time live and in person. So, thank you very much for the invitation, and I look forward to a great discussion.\n\nTop of mind for many of you are recent stresses in the banking system and what they mean for businesses, consumers, and the broader economy.\n\nFinally, as many of you know, the Federal Reserve Board, under the direction of Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr, is currently conducting a thorough review of the supervision and regulation of Silicon Valley Bank before its failure. This review will be completed by May 1, at which time the Board will share the results publicly.\n\nWhile the recent banking stresses have received a lot of attention, they are only part of the economic picture right now. In the remainder of my time today, I will discuss the full slate of factors the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) must consider as we work to assess the economy and calibrate monetary policy in this uncertain time.\n\nBut before I go on, let me say that the remarks I make today are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of anyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\n\nOngoing Economic Strength and High Inflation\n\nBy almost any measure, the U.S. economy remains strong. GDP growth, consumer spending, and the labor market all continue to outperform expectations. Moreover, these indicators are expanding at rates well above levels consistent with returning inflation to the FOMC’s longer-run goal of 2 percent on average over time.\n\nWe see this strength most clearly in the labor market. The U.S. economy has added close to 350,000 jobs per month over the first three months of this year. This far exceeds the 90,000 jobs needed each month to keep up with the growth of the labor force. This has kept unemployment historically low and job vacancies unusually high, especially for firms in rapidly growing sectors including travel, leisure, and hospitality, among others.\n\nMy colleagues and I are deeply aware of the toll that high inflation takes on the economy and the lives and livelihoods of all Americans, especially those least able to bear it. And we remain resolute and committed to bringing inflation down to our 2 percent goal. It is essential for both sides of our mandate, and we have the tools and the resolve to get the job done.\n\nPolicy Decisions under Uncertainty\n\nAnd that brings me to policy and what lies ahead in terms of our decisions. We have taken aggressive action over the past year, moving the federal funds rate from near zero to between 4.75 and 5 percent as of our March meeting. These actions have been warranted and consistent with our commitment to restore price stability.\n\nWhile the full impact of this policy tightening is still making its way through the system, the strength of the economy and the elevated readings on inflation suggest that there is more work to do.\n\nHow much more depends on several factors, all with considerable uncertainty attached to their evolution.\n\nFor one, there is the banking stress and the impact that it could have on credit conditions. History tells us that as banks evaluate the changing economic outlook and manage their liquidity and balance sheets, they are likely to tighten credit availability.\n\nHow much credit tightening will ultimately occur is not yet known. What we do know is that tighter credit conditions translate into less spending and investment by households and businesses, resulting in a slower pace of economic growth. So we will need to monitor this impact carefully as we determine our own policy path.\n\nFinally, there is the impact of our own monetary policy actions. The FOMC has increased the policy rates considerably over the past year, and it will likely take some time for those increases to take their full effect. But how much more time and how much additional slowing is coming is unclear. So like the other factors I have mentioned, we will need to carefully monitor the situation as we assess what it means for policy.\n\nThe Prudence of Data Dependence\n\nIn all actions, the FOMC is guided by a commitment to our mandated goals of full employment and price stability. When we are off either of our goals, Americans bear the cost, and we have an urgency to restore balance. But that urgency must be coupled with an awareness of the uncertainty we are facing, and the risks it poses to the economy.\n\nLooking ahead, there are good reasons to think that policy may have to tighten more to bring inflation down. But there are also good reasons to think that the economy may continue to slow, even without additional policy adjustments.\n\nSo, we will need to make decisions calibrated by data. Not just last week’s data or last month’s data, but all the data. Looking back and looking ahead as we navigate the uncertainty that surrounds us. This is what prudent policymaking requires, and what restoring price stability and achieving both of our mandates demands.\n\nThank you.\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences"

            "content": "Remarks as prepared for delivery.\n\nThe most frequent question I am asked these days is, “What will the Fed do next?”\n\nI understand. People are worried. Inflation is high and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has taken aggressive policy action to bring it down. The responses range from fearing these actions will tip the economy into a recession to fearing they won’t be enough to get the job done.\n\nFor most, this adds up to a lot of uncertainty. And the impulse to look for answers in the immediate. The next meeting. The next data release. The next market update. It doesn’t help that we face a round-the-clock ticker tape of economic and financial news.\n\nBut achieving our mandated goals takes time and a broader view. As policymakers, we have to respond to an economy that is evolving in real time and prepare for what the economy will look like in the future.\n\nSo today, I am going to do just that. I will pull back the lens from the immediate and talk about what the inflation landscape looked like before the pandemic, what it looks like now, and what both could mean for the future.\n\nBefore I get started, let me give the usual disclaimer that the views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues or anyone else within the Federal Reserve system.\n\nThe World We Had\n\nTo understand how future inflation could evolve, we must first remember where we were before the pandemic. So, let me start there.\n\nBefore the pandemic and the current episode of high inflation, the world was starkly different. The central and decade-long challenge for the Federal Reserve and most other central banks was trying to bring inflation up to target, rather than pushing it down.\n\nThis environment ended up offering some advantages. The economy was able to run consistently above estimates of potential growth and unemployment was able to fall to near-historic levels without spurring inflation.\n\nThis was the seemingly unchangeable topography of the economy before the pandemic.\n\nAnd then of course, everything changed.\n\nThe Pandemic Shock\n\nWe all know the story. When COVID-19 hit, the economy faltered. The Fed cut interest rates, purchased long-term assets, and opened lending facilities, all to help bridge the economy through the very worst. U.S. fiscal agents took equally aggressive action, infusing about $5 trillion in federal spending into the economy.\n\nAnd this is what we are seeing (Figure 2). The economy has been gradually slowing and inflation has followed. Since June of 2022, overall inflation has been easing, falling from its highs of around 7 percent to its current reading of 5.4 percent in January of this year.\n\nThis is good news, a sign that policy is doing its job and—along with improvements in supply—working to reduce the imbalances that have pushed inflation so high. But the work is far from done.\n\nOverall inflation remains well above target and contributions from each of the components of inflation—goods, housing, and other services—remain well above their historical trend (Figure 2). Moreover, the incoming data have been bumpy. The recent PCE reading is a good example. After months of decline, headline and core inflation both ticked up in January on a 12-month basis, and the monthly inflation rate rose at its fastest pace in seven months. This suggests that the disinflation momentum we need is far from certain.\n\nPutting all of this together, it’s clear there is more work to do. In order to put this episode of high inflation behind us, further policy tightening, maintained for a longer time, will likely be necessary. Restoring price stability is our mandate and it is what the American people expect. So, the FOMC remains resolute in achieving this goal.\n\nAs we work toward that end, we must also consider the world we are entering. What will the pressures on inflation be once the pandemic shock has fully worn off? Will we return to a world where the central bank struggles to get inflation up to target? Or has the pandemic left a more permanent imprint, such that the pressures on inflation now trend higher and we have to work to keep them at bay?\n\nThe answers aren’t yet clear. But the questions are imperative.\n\nAn Uncharted Path\n\nWe know what forces drove the pre-pandemic inflation trend. And we know what forces are driving the ongoing pandemic-induced inflation surge. What we don’t know is how they will evolve and interact after the pandemic is gone, or what this new confluence will mean for underlying inflation.\n\nIndeed, a number of forces have either grown in importance during the pandemic era or were set in motion by it. And I want to touch on four in particular that could counterbalance or even offset entirely the deflationary trend of the past.\n\nAny or all of these factors could influence the natural tilt of inflation and the monetary policy approach necessary to maintain price stability over the long term.\n\nThe hard part, of course, is knowing when and how each of these factors will evolve or what force they will have relative to the strong pull coming from population aging and slow productivity growth. If those pre-pandemic trends reemerge as the dominant structural forces, then our efforts to bring inflation down will be reinforced by natural features of the economy. But if the old dynamics are eclipsed by other, newer influences and the pressures on inflation start pushing upward instead of downward, then policy will likely need to do more.\n\nWe don’t know what the trend will be. But we do know that, while we continue to diffuse the ongoing inflation shock, we need to be working to gather data and research that illuminates the likely path forward. That’s prudent policymaking.\n\nThe Duality of Policymaking\n\nStill, when things are hard and you’re in the middle of it, it’s easy to get caught up in the here and now. So much so that we can forget to look forward, take stock, and imagine what the future could hold.\n\nBut policymaking requires it. The pandemic and its shockwaves will one day fully dissipate. And we must be ready.\n\nSo as I close today, I will return to the question I started with: What will the Fed do next?\n\nMy answer: We will work on the economy we have, and prepare for the economy to come. That’s what this moment demands.\n\nThank you.\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n\nArmantier, Olivier, Argia Sbordone, Giorgio Topa, Wilbert Van der Klaauw, and John C.

            "content": "These days, I am often asked how I think about monetary policy decisions. And that makes sense. Especially now, when the tradeoffs that many people fear—high inflation or hard recession—seem so severe. My answer is this: I am resolute and mindful. Resolute in achieving our goals. And mindful about how we do it.\n\nNow to some, it may seem like there is a conflict. They worry that resolute means “at any cost.” On the other side, people hear mindful and they worry we won’t go far enough—that we’ll stop short of getting the job fully done.\n\nBut resolute and mindful are complementary principles. And today, I will share how they inform my decisions as we strive to deliver low and stable prices and an economy that works for all.\n\nBefore I go on, let me remind you that the remarks I make are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of anyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\n\nFrom Low to High Inflation\n\nI’ll start by talking about where we are and how we got here. Because this, of course, sets the stage for what lies ahead.\n\nAs many of you know, Congress gave the Federal Reserve two mandates: price stability and maximum employment. Right now, we are only meeting one of those goals. The labor market is very strong and well aligned with our employment objective. In contrast, inflation is unacceptably high and has been that way for almost two years.\n\nThese unprecedented efforts worked. U.S. economic growth bounced back rapidly. By the second half of 2020, demand was growing and the labor market was on track to recover. Supply chains were lagging, but with vaccines coming online, there was hope that production would quickly return to full capacity.\n\nBy the fall of that year, inflation had risen further and looked to be gaining momentum. In contrast, unemployment was steadily declining and heading back to its historically low pre-pandemic level. In response, the Fed needed to remove accommodation and tighten policy much more quickly than it had previously signaled.\n\nPolicy Rebalancing\n\nThis and other forward guidance provided throughout that fall had an immediate impact. Almost overnight, financial conditions tightened. Market participants began pricing in expected future rate hikes, and businesses and households started readying themselves for a new interest rate landscape, pulling forward real estate purchases, restructuring debt obligations, and locking in longer-term fixed-rate loans. In other words, before we ever raised the federal funds rate, tighter financial conditions were already working their way through the system (Figure 1). Indeed, by the time of the first official rate hike of 25 basis points in March 2022, mortgage interest rates had risen three-quarters of a percentage point and broader financial conditions had tightened almost a full percentage point.\n\nThe responsiveness of financial conditions to our communications was notable and helpful. It gave us a head start on adjusting policy and mitigated the costs of an abrupt and unexpected change to the policy rate.\n\nWe began raising rates more quickly—expeditiously—moving the fed funds rate up in 75 basis point increments. This allowed us to swiftly withdraw accommodation and bring policy more in line with prevailing economic conditions. As of our last meeting just a few weeks ago, the target range of the federal funds rate stands at 3.75 to 4 percent, modestly restrictive relative to the neutral rate of interest. And we have signaled that there is more work to do.\n\nThis resolve has some people worried. They are concerned that resolute means unwilling to stop until the economy breaks or inflation hits 2 percent.\n\nFinding Sufficiently Restrictive\n\nAs we work to bring policy to a sufficiently restrictive stance—the level required to bring inflation down and restore price stability—we will need to be mindful. Adjusting too little will leave inflation too high. Adjusting too much could lead to an unnecessarily painful downturn.\n\nSo, what specifically do we need to be mindful of? Many things, of course. But in our November FOMC statement, we mention three in particular: the cumulative tightening in place, the lags in monetary policy, and the evolution of the data.\n\nLet’s start with cumulative tightening. Historically, we’ve used progress on the federal funds rate and where it stands relative to its neutral value as a gauge for policy restrictiveness. But in today’s world, that is only part of the picture. The funds rate does not capture the impact of the other tools in our tool kit, including the reduced asset holdings associated with balance sheet roll-off and the forward guidance we’ve provided about the future path of policy. It also misses the fact that central banks across the globe are tightening policy as well, likely amplifying the effects of our own rate hikes.\n\nAs we make decisions about further rate adjustments, it will be important to remain conscious of this gap between the federal funds rate and the tightening in financial markets. Ignoring it raises the chances of tightening too much.\n\nThis is consistent with what we have seen in the data. The Fed started tightening policy close to a year ago. Interest-sensitive sectors like housing started to cool very quickly. As mortgage rates rose, home sales, construction activity, and the pace of house price gains slowed. Labor markets remain solid but are showing early signs of cooling. Job openings are down about 10 percent from their March high and job growth is slowing from its rapid pace last year. And although one month of data does not a victory make, the latest inflation report had some encouraging numbers, including a long awaited decline in goods price inflation.\n\nLooking ahead, I will be watching for further calming in these areas, as well as signs that pandemic-related imbalances between supply and demand are continuing to subside. I will also be in continuous dialogue with business leaders, workers, and community members in my District. Policy decisions also require that we look forward. Real-time conversations yield insights about how people are faring and how the economy is changing before they ever show up in the published data.\n\nAs we navigate back to price stability, we will need to pay attention to all of these things and adjust policy accordingly. And because the economy is dynamic, we will need to do this on an ongoing basis. We have to constantly calibrate our stance of policy to meet evolving conditions.\n\nA Job Fully Done\n\nWhile resolute and mindful are not in conflict, there is a tension. And that’s what we want in policymaking.\n\nWe want to go far enough that we get the job done. That’s the resolute part. But not so far that we overdo it. And that’s the mindful part.\n\nSo, we will march unwaveringly toward our goals. Resolute and mindful, until the job is fully done.\n\nThank you.\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n\nMertens, Thomas M., and John C.

            "content": "Good afternoon. It’s a pleasure to be back here in Boise and to be on campus at Boise State. So, thank you very much for the opportunity. I look forward to your questions and to our discussion.\n\nNow, these goals are often characterized as tradeoffs. More of one means less of the other. But for most people, they are deeply intertwined.\n\nI know this from my many years as a policymaker. But I also know it from experience.\n\nI grew up in Ballwin, Missouri, during the Great Inflation of the 1970s. Rapidly rising prices made it hard for working families like mine to afford the things we needed. Eventually, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates and inflation came down. But the abruptness and magnitude of the response caused two painful recessions. Unemployment soared. Jobs became tough to find. And one impossible situation gave way to another.\n\nI didn’t know it then, but this experience would teach me an enduring lesson, one that I would carry with me over the course of my career as a policymaker. The lesson is that economic security depends on both jobs and stable prices. Together, these two pillars form the foundation for everything else.\n\nSeen in this light, the Federal Reserve actually has a singular purpose: to keep the economy on a sustainable path by delivering low, stable prices and durable labor market strength.\n\nToday, I am going to discuss this singular purpose and how price stability and full employment work together to support it. But before I continue, let me remind you that the views I will express are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\n\nInextricably Linked\n\nIf you travel almost anywhere in the United States these days, you’ll hear two things about the economy. The first is that the labor market is strong. The second is that inflation is high.\n\nBoth of these things are true.\n\nSo it’s a great time to be a worker, right?\n\nWell, not so much. Inflation is high, running well over the Fed’s average 2 percent target for well over a year now. This can be traced back to a number of factors, but it boils down to a large and persistent imbalance between demand and supply. Demand has been supported by pandemic-related monetary and fiscal relief, robust household savings and, over the past year, a very strong labor market. At the same time, domestic and global supply have been highly constrained, hit by a series of negative shocks, including the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and severe labor shortages.\n\nPersistent high inflation across a broad range of goods and services is eroding the purchasing power of earnings, even those that are rising. This erosion is insidious—a gradual, but persistent chipping away of living standards. The picture makes this clear (see Figure 1). Price inflation measured by the consumer price index, or CPI, has been rising far faster than average hourly earnings. Indeed, average real wages, which take account of inflation, have declined by 9 percent over the past two years. This means that the average worker in the U.S. economy has lost rather than gained ground, all while the labor market remains historically strong.\n\nThis corroding of real wages is more than just painful. It also undermines the basic American promise, which says that if you work hard, you can get ahead. Inflation traps people in an endless loop of running fast and falling behind, unrelated to effort or input.\n\nEventually, this sense of falling behind starts to affect decisionmaking.\n\nDistortions and Decisions\n\nAs people struggle to keep up with rising prices, earning money becomes the central factor in determining which jobs they choose.\n\nNow, in some ways this seems fine. We work so we can buy things—to support ourselves, take care of our families, and give back to our communities. But when wages dominate all other considerations, like the type of job we do or the chance for future mobility, they become a wedge—putting space between what people need today and what they want for their future.\n\nWorkers everywhere are facing these choices. I recently heard an example at a gathering of local business leaders. One of them was from a large restaurant group with locations in multiple cities. It offered competitive salaries, health benefits, and lots of opportunities for professional growth. But longtime employees who had been advancing through the ranks and building careers with the organization were suddenly leaving. When the owner asked them why, he learned they were no longer able to afford rent near the city and had to move much farther away. Then gas prices started to rise and commuting so far became unsustainable. So many of them left to take lower-paying fast-food jobs nearer to where they lived. These jobs had fewer benefits and little opportunity for upward mobility. But what choice did they have? They had to manage their short-term budget pressures, even when it meant giving up jobs with brighter long-term prospects.\n\nAnd here again, these individual choices bubble up to firms. Their strategic decisions about where to locate, expand, and invest are shaped by the projected availability of workers, especially skilled ones. As they plan for their future, declining school enrollments will factor into all of these decisions.\n\nIn other words, persistently high inflation is painful and it’s disruptive. It seeps into everything, including investment, production, and growth. Over time, it accumulates into a mountain of misallocations and lost opportunities. And it adds up to a smaller economic pie for all.\n\nAnd this is why price stability is so crucial. It allows households and businesses to make decisions based on preferences, ideas, drive, and talent and lays the foundation for sustainable growth and durable expansion now and in the future. Price stability is like an asset that pays dividends year after year. And protecting it supports everyone.\n\nReturning to Two Percent\n\nThe question of course, is how?\n\nNavigating the economy toward a more sustainable path necessitates higher interest rates and a downshift in the pace of economic activity and the labor market. But for now, inducing a deep recession does not seem warranted by conditions, nor is it necessary to achieve our goals.\n\nAvoiding this kind of harsh recession will not be easy, but we must try.\n\nTwo Mandates, One Goal\n\nThe enduring lesson of my childhood is that people need both jobs and stable prices. That is why the dual mandate is not a choice between two desirable things. It is a balance meant to deliver on a singular goal—a sustainable and expanding economy that works for everyone.\n\nThat is the foundation of economic security. And that is what the Federal Reserve is working to achieve.\n\nThank you.\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n\nAltonji, Joseph G., Lisa B. Kahn, and Jamin D. Speer. 2016. “Cashier or Consultant?

            "content": "A few weeks ago, I met a young man with a warehouse job. He was worried. He shared that he had just called in sick to his employer. When I asked him if it was COVID, he told me no. He just couldn’t afford the gas that day and still manage to pay his rent.\n\nNow it would be of little consolation to him to learn that much of the inflation we see today is driven by supply chain bottlenecks or the ongoing war in Ukraine. Nor would he be relieved to learn that excess demand, supported by fiscal and monetary policy aid and a robust recovery, were to blame. All he and so many others want to know is, when will this end?\n\nSo, let me start by saying here what I said to him: Bringing inflation down is the Federal Reserve’s number one priority right now. And we have the tools and the will to do it.\n\nBut we actually want to do more than that. We want to bring inflation down without crippling growth and stalling the labor market.\n\nAfterall that is the dual mandate. Our job is to ensure that Americans everywhere have opportunities to earn a living and the confidence that the living they earn will hold its value.\n\nSo today, I will talk about how we can achieve that. But first, let me remind you that the views I share are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\n\nEvolving Risks\n\nTo understand the path going forward, we first need to understand how we arrived here. So, let’s start there.\n\nThe earliest signs of rising inflation pressures came in the spring of 2021. At that time, overall inflation was running below the Fed‘s 2 percent target, as it had been for over a decade.\n\nBut conditions were changing. Fiscal and monetary policy support were charging through the system, boosting demand for a variety of goods. At the same time, COVID was still ravaging supply chains, disrupting production and distribution, and leaving accumulated backlogs for a range of products.\n\nThe challenges were apparent. Consumers were robustly purchasing goods, while suppliers were having trouble making and delivering them. And as we would expect, price pressures emerged.\n\nIn other words, at that time the risk landscape on future inflation was decidedly two-sided. We could act preemptively to stave off the potential for broadening price pressures only to find inflation once again too low, or we could wait until the path of inflation was clearer and find ourselves with inflation too high.\n\nThe Power of Communicating\n\nThe evolving landscape meant that monetary policy had to pivot. And it had to do so quickly.\n\nBut just as the risks facing the economy have evolved, so has our policy approach, which can respond more nimbly now to incoming data than it could in the past.\n\nFor example, in the fall of last year, as incoming information confirmed that persistent and broad price pressures were forming, FOMC participants signaled that the future path of policy would likely be tighter. The December FOMC statement and the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) moved sharply relative to previous releases, projecting an earlier date of liftoff and a faster pace of rate hikes than previously anticipated. At the same time, we communicated that the balance sheet would adjust accordingly.\n\nFollowing this forward guidance and prior to any actual movements in the funds rate, yields on Treasuries across all durations rose, and rates in other markets followed suit. Mortgage rates, for example, started an ascent that currently puts them at their highest levels in a decade.\n\nWhile adjustments in financial markets after FOMC communications are not unusual, the speed and magnitude of the movements during the past six months have been unprecedented, as the figure shows.\n\nThe fact that financial conditions and real activity are adjusting to expected monetary policy tightening, even when actual rates have not fully risen, means that long and variable lags may not be as long, or variable, as typically assumed. And that supports policy nimbleness, allowing monetary policy to be tighter than the actual level of the Fed Funds rate would suggest.\n\nBut guidance requires action. And here is how I see that work evolving.\n\nFrom Risks to Realities\n\nJust as 2021 required navigating a broad range of possible outcomes, policymaking now is also about managing risks. If supply continues to fall short and inflation remains high, we will need to do more. If conditions improve and supply bounces back, we can do less.\n\nRegardless of which path we take, there will likely be some slowing in the economy. That’s how monetary policy works. We remove accommodation or adjust rates into more restrictive territory, and growth slows and the labor market cools.\n\nThe question is: how much economic slowing are we likely to see? Here, history gives us some useful reference points.\n\nOne is the Great Inflation of the 1960s and ’70s and the subsequent Volcker disinflation, which, by the mid-1980s, had brought inflation down from its double-digit peak. But it came at a very high cost, pushing the economy into what was then the most severe recession since the Great Depression.\n\nFor a number of reasons, I expect our economic transition now to look more like the mid-1990s than like the 1970’s Great Inflation and subsequent painful disinflation. That’s because many of the factors that helped fuel the Great Inflation are not as prominent today.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is also different than it was back then. We are a far more transparent institution now. We regularly share our views about the economy, our goals, and our expected policy path. This tells markets and the public more generally what we are thinking and how we are likely to react as the economy changes. This consistent communication has helped keep longer run inflation expectations anchored despite persistent months of high inflation readings. It also has allowed us to respond to evolving data more nimbly and influence the behavior of financial markets and the economy more quickly.\n\nFinally, conditions in the economy are quite different now than they were in the Great Inflation. There is a sizeable amount of excess demand in both product and labor markets, supported by COVID related fiscal and monetary policy. This translates into large, accumulated back orders for goods and historically high job vacancies in the labor market. Adjusting rates to slow the economy will most likely reduce these backlogs and high job vacancies before digging into current production and employment.\n\nIn its extreme form, this implies that policy adjustments to lower inflation will be cost free. While I think that scenario is highly unlikely, I do expect the costs of adjustment to be moderate, with some slowing of GDP growth below its longer-run trend and an increase in the unemployment rate from the very low levels we see today.\n\nThis would, to my mind, constitute a relatively smooth transition from a pandemic-wracked, highly accommodative economy to one in which tighter policy supports both full employment and price stability.\n\nThat is the future that I am working toward.\n\nCommitment\n\nCreating that future will not be easy. Some have called it a narrow path.\n\nBut we know the direction we need to head, we understand the risks we face, and we have the tools to respond to a range of conditions however they emerge.\n\nMost importantly, we have the will to act. Not just for this moment, but also for similar events in the future. Always recognizing that our decisions affect every American and no one should have to choose between fueling up to get to work and paying rent to keep their home.\n\nThank you.\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n\nBasu, Susanto, and John G.

            "content": "Thank you for that kind introduction.  I’m so happy to be here and honored to be part of your celebration.\n\nSpeaking of celebrating, before I get started, I would like all the graduates—and only the graduates—to give yourselves a big round of applause.  This is a special day, and I want each of you to take in its meaningfulness.  For everyone else—family, friends, professors, university leaders—these graduates are our future and I stand with you in looking forward to what they will do.\n\nNow the last time I sat where you are today was 1994, almost 30 years ago.  I was graduating with my Ph.D. from Syracuse University and looking forward to my new life as an economist.  So when I got my first job in the research department at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco I was excited.  And in 2018, when I got the job I have now as president and CEO I was ecstatic.\n\nWhen the job as President became available, I knew I was qualified.  But I also knew the competition would be tough.  After all, the Fed is a storied institution.  Many of the world’s great economists have passed through its doors.  Most of my colleagues arrived from schools like Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Stanford—pedigrees that could be intimidating.  And now I was competing against hundreds of applicants inside and outside of the Fed with portfolios that I thought could be better than mine.\n\nAnd so, I did what many of us do to stand out:  I wrote a beautiful cover letter.  It was truly a work of art.  It expounded on history, the state of the nation, and how my long list of credentials, accumulated over my career, were meant for an opportunity like this.  One week later when I finished, I proudly showed it to an acquaintance who had experience in hiring.  And she said, “Wow Mary, this letter is amazing.” And then she said, “…but anyone could have written it.”\n\nMy heart sank, but I also knew she was right.  I had written the letter I thought the hiring committee wanted to read.  And I was presenting the person I thought I needed to be to get the job.  A person, in my mind, who bore only an abstract resemblance to the real me.\n\nLet me tell you about the real me:  I grew up in Ballwin, Missouri.  And when I was fifteen, I dropped out of high school. My family was struggling and I thought my time would be better spent earning an income.  So, I cobbled together a schedule of odd jobs.  I worked at a donut shop and at Target, hoping to eventually become a bus driver—stable employment with good income and benefits.  By an unexpected twist of fate, I met someone who encouraged me to get a GED.  Later, I became the first in my family to attend and graduate from college.\n\nThat was my story, and it was—to put it mildly—very different from most of my colleagues and anyone else who had ever held the position I was trying to get.  So I left it out of the letter and focused on credentials and accomplishments and things that made me similar rather than different.\n\nAnd it wasn’t the first time I had done this.  In my early years at the Fed, I felt the need to fit into a certain mold.  So, I went shopping.  I bought pearls and skirt suits, even a scoop neck sweater.  Now anyone who knows me, or has even seen me, knows that I’m most comfortable in slacks and a collared shirt, my outfit of choice most days.  But back then, I dressed as the person I thought people wanted to see.  I even tried to style my hair a certain way.  I worked to become economist Mary, rather than just Mary.\n\nBut that mindset spread and began to permeate everything.  In conversations with colleagues, I was careful not to veer into topics that were too personal.  I tried not to reveal too much of my background.  I kept things focused on work, job, and contribution, all with the view that people can’t judge what they don’t know.\n\nPretending, as it turns out, is exhausting.  It is also hugely limiting.  I was sitting on a mountain of experience that gave me unique insight into how the economy functions.  As a kid from Missouri, I witnessed firsthand how people get left behind—fall through the cracks—and the lasting impact, generations out, that this can have on families.  I saw the toll that poverty takes and the stress people feel when they don’t have opportunities.  But I never talked about it.  And so on the outside I looked like everyone else. I had become Mary the economist with a job as a researcher, instead of Mary from Missouri with a GED.\n\nThe irony of course, is that no one actually asked me to play a role.  I had done this to myself. And when I started to understand that, I started to change. Gradually. Little by little, I shed the pearls and the skirts.  I let my hair be wild.  I even agreed to a profile story in a major news outlet that revealed personal details about my past.\n\nGetting the space to be myself was a remarkable gift.  I felt newly at ease, and that ease translated into opportunities.  By being open and me—all of me—I attracted people with diverse ideas.  I connected my experiences with my research and found capacity that I didn’t know I had. I became so much better at my job.  But mostly I found fortitude and confidence from aligning my inner with my outer self.  Mary with a GED who also had a Ph.D. And perhaps unsurprisingly, my career took off.\n\nWhich brings me back to 2018, 20 years after I stopped wearing pearls, applying for the top job at the bank where I had built my career, and here I was back to my old habits.  Once again, playing a role.  Back to being the Mary that I thought people wanted.\n\nSo, I re-wrote the letter.  But this time, I leaned into my story.  I talked about my life growing up in Ballwin, MO, the eldest of four siblings, in a family with challenges, and how those experiences helped me understand the responsibility of institutions and the honor of serving others.  I also talked about dignity and the importance of the economy in creating and sustaining opportunities for everyone.  I wrote it in two hours.  And no one else could have written it.  And when I hit send, I felt absolutely terrified.\n\nOf course, we all know how the story ends.  Six months and many interviews later, I got the job—not in spite of where I came from, but, in part, because of it.  And I relearned what I’d learned many times before.  Difference, my difference, is a virtue, not a weakness.\n\nAnd this brings me to the time in my speech where I very much want to impart some lasting wisdom.  A philosophy for how to live your life and accomplish your dreams.  It’s simple:  “Be yourself.” “Stay true to who you are.” This is good advice.  You should do those things.  But the truth is, you probably already know that.\n\nWhat you might not know—what I have learned over the course of my 30-year career—is that being yourself isn’t a switch that you can simply turn on. It’s a journey of discovery, and it’s one that you will have to take over and over again.\n\nThroughout your lives and career, you will likely lose yourself here and there.  You will drift away from the person you know you are.  You may feel out of sorts or like you don’t fit in.  And you may want to hide. And in those times, you very well might do as I have done, and take refuge behind a mask of your own making. And that’s okay.  It’s part of being human.\n\nThere is safety in conformity.  Being yourself, especially when yourself is different from others, can feel risky.  It leaves all of us feeling vulnerable and exposed. But as you embark on your careers—as you stretch for new things and find yourself in unfamiliar places—find your way back, return to the core of who you are.  That is the place from which your greatness will grow.\n\nYou are the sum total of every experience, every triumph, and every hardship that you have endured.  And this singular equation is your superpower.  It is the secret combination that unlocks your innate talents and sets you apart from every other person you meet.  It is what makes your letter uniquely yours.\n\nAnd so, class of 2022: what will your letter say?\n\nMy wish for you is that it will say the things you are most afraid to reveal.  That these revelations will upend assumptions about who belongs where.  That your bravery will fly in the face of the worry and fear and all of the other emotions that arise when we strive for something more.  And most of all, I hope your letter will be unmistakably, unapologetically, you.\n\nAnd to that you, I say:  Congratulations on this momentous achievement of your graduation.  I cannot wait to see what amazing things you will do."

Nevada is thriving, growing, and moving enthusiastically toward a post-pandemic world.\n\nAnd this is true for the economy as a whole. After two years of pandemic-related economic challenges, signs of health are everywhere. The job market is robust, household and business balance sheets are strong, and consumer and business sentiments are solid, despite the war in Ukraine and rising prices at the gas pump.\n\nOf course, everyone agrees that inflation is too high. Across the country, Americans are waking up and going to bed worried about whether their incomes will keep up with the rising cost of rent, food, and fuel. Businesses are also worried, some thinking twice about committing to long-term contracts that may become too costly to fulfill if prices continue to rise. Put simply, households and businesses are feeling the pain and asking when things will get better.\n\nSo today, I will spend my time discussing inflation and how monetary policy has and will adjust to bring it down and put the economy back on a sustainable path. But before I get started, let me remind you that the views I will share today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\n\nFocusing on Inflation\n\nThe key insight of the dual mandate is that both sides matter. It was critical to assist the economy in recovering the job losses that occurred early in the pandemic, and it is now critical to stem what has been a longer-than-expected run of high inflation.\n\nThe question is how to do that smoothly. And to determine that, we have to understand how we got here.\n\nThe simple answer is COVID. Lockdowns early in the pandemic, transportation issues, and labor shortages constrained the supply of many goods. And these supply disruptions fell largely outside the scope of policy. After all, policymakers can do little to get more cars to the lot or more appliances into stores.\n\nIn contrast, we have a range of tools to help people buy what they need. And these tools were deployed to help households sustain while we fought the pandemic. For those who lost their incomes, fiscal policy provided a lifeline. To bolster growth and employment, monetary policy turned accommodative. These measures helped sustain consumer spending and get people through the worst of the crisis.\n\nSince high inflation was initially caused by the pandemic and our responses to it, the expectation has been that it will recede as COVID does. The problem is that, while COVID has abated, it has not disappeared. We can more easily do things like go out for dinner, travel, and see a movie. But countries and firms managing new variants and rising caseloads have not been able to return to full production. So, supply chain disruptions have lingered. And the war in Ukraine has further pressured supply, especially for energy, food, and other critical commodities.\n\nThis is a history no one wants to repeat. And it’s why the Fed is taking actions today, far earlier than in the 1970s, to tighten policy, rebalance demand and supply, and ensure that both of our dual mandate goals are achieved.\n\nThe obvious next question is, how will we get there?\n\nHow We Get There Matters\n\nThe truth is, there is a hard way and an easier way.\n\nTo see what I mean, imagine you’re in a car. You’re driving along the highway and you spot a hazard up ahead. At this point, you know you need to slow down. One way to do it is to slam hard on the brakes. You’ll achieve your goal, but you and your passengers will probably suffer in the process. You might jerk forward in your seat or spill coffee on your lap. That’s the hard way. The better way is to purposefully and smoothly decelerate. You avoid the danger, and you spare yourself and others the whiplash. Most importantly, you get to continue your trip.\n\nI think we can all agree that this is good driving. But it is also good policymaking. If we slam the brakes on the economy by adjusting rates too quickly or too much, we risk forcing unnecessary adjustments by businesses and households, potentially tipping the economy into recession. If we ease on the brakes by methodically removing accommodation and regularly assessing how much more is needed, we have a good chance of transitioning smoothly and gliding the economy to its long-run sustainable path.\n\nFor many reasons, this is not my modal outlook. First, the conditions we face today are very different from the 1970s. For one thing, current high inflation readings have a clear catalyst—the pandemic. Moreover, the duration of rising prices has been far shorter—a year, rather than a decade. And in stark contrast to the 1970s, longer-run inflation expectations have remained stable.\n\nThis bullishness likely reflects the strong underlying momentum in the U.S. economy, as well as the public’s confidence that, even as rates rise and the economy slows, growth and the labor market will remain solid.\n\nBut this will take work. And let me turn to that next.\n\nNavigating Policy Out of the Pandemic\n\nAs I have noted, the inflation outlook combined with a strong labor market leave no doubt that further policy tightening is appropriate. The question is, how much and how quickly?\n\nLet’s start with how much. The first step is to remove the accommodation that we provided during the pandemic. That means raising the federal funds rate to its neutral level, which most forecasters put at around 2.5 percent in nominal terms. We started that journey in March with a 25-basis-point rate increase, so we still have significant work to do. Moving purposefully to a more neutral stance that does not stimulate the economy is the top priority.\n\nAnd this is where the question of timing comes in. How quickly should we get there? Accounting for the risks of being too fast or too slow, I see an expeditious march to neutral by the end of the year as a prudent path. We will continue to evaluate the data and the risks, but today I see little indication that the economy needs policy accommodation.\n\nThere is the uncertainty about COVID. While it feels like our recovery from the pandemic is gaining traction here in the United States, China and other global producers are in the midst of another wave of lockdowns to manage outbreaks. This makes it hard to declare victory on the pandemic or to be comfortable about the projected recovery of supply chains.\n\nAll of this means that it’s hard to fully know what next year will look like. Will we be in a world where supply chains have healed, inflation has come down, and policy can remain close to neutral? Or will we be in a world where disruptions remain, inflation persists, and monetary policy must further adjust to restrain the economy, balance supply and demand, and return inflation to our price stability objective? The data will tell us over the course of this year, and we will be prepared to respond when it does.\n\nBut no matter what happens next year, that will not be the end of our work. The Fed’s overarching job is to foster a long and durable expansion that delivers both full employment and price stability. We need to calibrate policy to get back on that path. We need to manage the economic headwinds immediately in front of us. But we also need to lay the groundwork for the economy we want in the future. A truly smooth transition does both.\n\nGo Smooth to Go Far\n\nLet me leave you with a story that illustrates my approach to policymaking and how I will navigate the challenges ahead. As a teenager, I worked at a donut shop. Part of my job was to drive a delivery truck. I drove the long-distance route at night, when traffic was sparse. As you might expect, I sometimes went a little too fast. And as you also might expect, that didn’t turn out too well. I wound up losing my license for three weeks—which, to me, felt like a lifetime.\n\nThat youthful mistake taught me a valuable lesson. Getting there is important. But so is the journey. In my attempt to get there quickly, I actually didn’t get there at all. Though I didn’t know it at the time, I had taken the hard way.\n\nBut we don’t have to. A smooth and methodical approach to policy will alert us to hazards along the way, prepare us for unexpected bumps in the road, and ultimately keep us moving forward—not just to our immediate destination, but to all of the destinations that follow.\n\nThank you.\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n\nCoibion, Olivier, and Yuriy Gorodnichenko. 2015. “Is the Phillips Curve Alive and Well After All?

            "content": "Thank you, Andrew. Let me begin by saying welcome to everyone. Good morning. Good afternoon. Good evening, from wherever you’re viewing. I extend a very warm welcome to you. My only disappointment about this conference is that we’re not in person, but hopefully next year will either be in person or hybrid. For now, we will continue virtually and continue to do the important work of this conference.\n\nI’d like to take a moment to say why this event is so important to us. We’ve been hosting this conference for a very long time. And in each of the years I’ve attended, which is now more than I can count, we do the same thing. We bring in cutting edge researchers, research, and policymakers to have a dialogue and a productive discussion about the problems that face us as central banks, as nations, and as societies. And today will be no departure from that.\n\nWe are delighted to have a terrific program, but also to have Deputy Governor Sharon Kozicki from the Bank of Canada talk about some of the things that she and the Bank of Canada are facing, and actually central banks across the globe as we make monetary policy.\n\nNow, when I think about the challenges of central banking right now, they’re easy to enumerate, but hard to grasp. So, we start with coming out of a pandemic where central banks offered extraordinary support, along with fiscal agents, to get as many people through the pandemic as possible. And, while in many countries, we’re hoping that we’re moving from pandemic to endemic, we only have to look at parts of Asia to realize that we’re not there yet. So, we still have to grapple with those things and think about how to best support our economies. And at the same time, we have a devastating war in the Ukraine. I would be remiss if I didn’t start by extending my heartfelt sympathy to the Ukrainian people and all the suffering that they’re enduring. But it also affects the economy. It creates uncertainty, it creates challenges in supply chains for commodities, and it puts additional pressure on inflation, which is too high. Higher than most policymakers have as their target for price stability. And that’s true across the globe. But in the United States, we’re at a 40-year high. People are thinking about inflation when they go to bed at night and when they wake up in the morning, and that’s far from our target for price stability.\n\nAnd then, of course, we have things that typically get called existential threats, but I don’t think they’re existential. We’re seeing them already. And that is threats to our climate, and how it will not just threaten our physical environment, but also change the allocation of production. Change the pricing for assets, all things that will matter as we try to craft policy going forward. We also have inequality. Generations of economists have documented this, but we’re starting to ask better questions about inequality, moving from what I was taught, which is just a scoring of well-being, and how certain people aren’t doing as well as others. But we’re asking fundamentally how much inequality we can endure and still have an economy that’s sustainable and works for everyone.\n\nThese are all big questions that both monetary policymakers and fiscal agents have to think about, that we as societies have to think about. And so our program today is very well suited, as it has been historically, for asking and answering the questions that we face. We’ll have a couple of papers on inflation and what’s driving it. And we’re going to have an important paper on climate and another important paper on inequality. And when you think about those things, this is what the conference is about. It’s about bringing us together, taking on the challenges that we face, and asking and answering these questions with evidence, thoughts, and paradigms that help us do better and make our policy better.\n\nSo with that, I will say that I’m really looking forward to the day. I would be remiss not to thank the conference organizers. I’d like to thank from the San Francisco Fed Andrew Foerster, Huiyu Li, Fernanda Nechio and Nicolas Petrosky-Nadeau, who have put the program together and carry the tradition of bringing together the best research with policymaking in a way that will be a robust dialogue.\n\nAnd I finally have to thank Margaret Cliver, who works behind the scenes to make all of this possible so that we can have our dialogue. Without Margaret, none of this would happen. So thank you, Margaret, for all the work you do. Thank you to the conference organizers and Deputy Governor Kozicki for coming and to all the researchers here presenting your work. I look forward to an exciting day and I’m appreciative of everything that all of you do. With that, I’ll turn it back to Andrew to start the morning session."

            "content": "It’s hard to believe it’s been almost two years since COVID-19 hit our shores. And while it’s not fully behind us, we’ve come a long way, especially in the economy. Growth is up.  Unemployment is down. And people are getting back to their lives.\n\nBut as anyone who has shopped, bought gas, or paid rent lately knows, inflation is high—higher than it has been in nearly four decades.\n\nFor some, this is a sign that price stability is at risk. That, absent aggressive action by the Fed, the economy will be propelled into a 1970s-style “Great Inflation.”\n\nLike many of you, I lived through that time. I remember my parents’ daily complaints about rising prices and rising bills, and the hours-long waits at gas stations in the hot Missouri sun, stuck to the vinyl seats of our station wagon.\n\nHigh and rising inflation made life harder. And there was no end in sight.\n\nBut the picture today looks different. And so does the Federal Reserve. We have evolved as an institution, and our understanding and tools have evolved as well. I’ll spend my time today talking about how this evolution makes us better prepared to meet our dual mandate goals of price stability and full employment, even in these challenging times.\n\nFirst, I want to remind you that the views I will express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThen…\n\nBefore I talk about what’s different this time, let me talk about what exactly happened during the “Great Inflation.” What was it like?\n\nPeople wondered how it had happened.\n\nThe first has to do with fundamental economic changes and our inability back then to measure and understand them in real time.\n\nBut the story doesn’t end there. The Fed’s policy misses were amplified and perpetuated by institutional factors and by its own communication strategy.\n\nWhen two oil price shocks created even higher inflation, prices and wages grew in near lockstep. And here is where the Fed’s own communication practices exacerbated things.\n\nBecause of this, the Fed operated largely behind closed doors. The public became aware of Fed policy actions by watching how markets reacted following Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. And the main source of information that market participants, households, and businesses had about the Fed’s commitment to price stability was what they could glean from incoming inflation data.\n\nThe result was predictable.\n\nAnd you can see it in this figure. The green and blue lines show two measures of actual inflation and the red line shows inflation expectations.\n\nBefore long, inflation dynamics and future inflation were deeply intertwined with inflation psychology. And with the Fed offering little guidance or reassurance that it would do something about it, the situation snowballed.\n\nIt wasn’t until the Fed implemented a series of steep interest rate hikes that inflation finally started to recede.\n\n…Now\n\nNow inflation is high again and many are concerned that we could soon be facing another long and painful period, followed by another long and painful correction.\n\nBut that’s not what I see. Let me explain.\n\nYou’ve heard many, including me, talk about how inflation itself is different this time. It’s been pushed up by pandemic-related imbalances between policy-supported demand, which has remained robust, and COVID-disrupted supply, which has been slow to recover. Both of these factors should recede as the pandemic weakens its grip.\n\nBut these are not the differences that matter most. The main reason I’m confident we are not heading for another 1970s-style Great Inflation is that the Federal Reserve is different. And I’m not referring to the people of the Fed, who clearly have changed, but to the practices and beliefs, which have changed even more.\n\nActing on this insight required a radical transformation. The Fed had to break open its “black box” of decision-making and embrace transparency.\n\nTo understand the magnitude of this transformation, you have to recall that, for most of its history, the Fed was uncommunicative.\n\nAs the figure illustrates, the Fed went from being mostly silent to explicitly and intentionally transparent.\n\nThe effects of these efforts can be seen in the data.\n\nThis tells us that businesses and markets are listening. They’re hearing the Fed’s communications and believe that we will act on our commitments.\n\nMost importantly, greater transparency and a strong commitment to achieving our goals assures Americans that periods of high inflation or unemployment will not last forever; that there is an end in sight.\n\nFocused and Aware\n\nBut transparency is not a destination, it’s a practice. And it requires ongoing communication if we are to keep the credibility that we so value.\n\nIn that spirit, let me tell you about how I see the economy today and the policy adjustments that will be needed to move us to a sustainable path.\n\nLet’s start with the economy. By almost any measure, it is doing well. GDP growth, consumer spending, and business investment are all up, and the labor market continues to post solid job gains, low unemployment, and strong wage growth. Importantly, labor market gains have been broad based, occurring for a wide range of groups, including those who are traditionally disadvantaged—African Americans, Hispanics, and people with less than a college education.\n\nThis means it is time to move away from the extraordinary support that the Fed has been providing during the pandemic and bring monetary policy in line with the challenges of today. Absent any significant negative surprises, I see our next meeting, in March, as the appropriate time to begin this adjustment.\n\nThe timing and magnitude of future funds rate and balance sheet adjustments will depend on how the economy and the data evolve. And this will depend on how well we transition from pandemic to endemic; how much and how quickly supply chains recover; how rapidly workers sidelined by health, family care, or other COVID-related barriers return to the labor force; and how quickly the fiscal boost that aided spending in 2020 and 2021 fades. We will closely watch all of these developments and let the data determine the appropriate path of policy.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the next few years will require focused awareness; focus on bringing inflation back down to levels consistent with price stability and delivering a labor market that works for everyone; and awareness, of the uncertainty that lies ahead and the challenges that are surely before us.\n\nDifferent Never Rests\n\nThat for me is the main lesson of the Great Inflation. It’s not really about the Fed. It’s not even really about economics.\n\nIt’s about humility.\n\nIt’s about knowing that ours is an economy in transition. And that none of us knows for sure what the new future holds.\n\nWe need to move forward with confidence—in our policy, in our tools, and in the credibility the Fed has built. But we also have to remember that evolution isn’t static. And to meet the needs of a constantly changing economy, we have to be constantly changing.\n\nToday’s Federal Reserve looks different than it did 50 years ago. And I expect that it will look different again in 50 more.\n\nAnd that will be a good thing. It will mean the evolution continued. And that next time will also be different.\n\nThank you.\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n\nBasu, Susanto, and John G.

            "content": "These are unusual times.\n\nThe very worst of the pandemic looks to be behind us—a welcome relief. But the impact of COVID and its ongoing threat continue to disrupt and delay the full recovery of the economy.\n\nWorse perhaps is that we don’t know how long any of this will last. We are in flux—limbo—waiting for the pandemic to be done so we can move on to whatever the new future holds.\n\nBut waiting is hard, and it’s tempting to want to act. To want to respond to what we see today as if it’s a clear signal of what we will see tomorrow.\n\nAction, after all, feels empowering.\n\nBut feeling empowered and empowering our future are two different things. Acting without clarity is risky. It can lead to decisions that have costly unintended consequences, box us into outcomes, and make the flux we feel today a more persistent feature of our economic future than it needs to be.\n\nToday, I’m going to talk about how the recognition of ongoing uncertainty affects monetary policy and the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate of price stability and full employment. And about why the Fed is taking a vigilant and measured approach as we navigate the long tail of the pandemic.\n\nBut before I get too far along, I want to remind you that the views I will express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\n\nTaking Stock of the Economy We Have\n\nInflation\n\nLet me start by taking stock of where we are today.\n\nHere is the headline: Inflation is high. Both overall and core inflation have been running well above the Fed’s two percent goal. In fact, overall inflation is at its highest level in 30 years, with price increases in some sectors hitting eye-popping rates.\n\nThe magnitude and persistence of these readings has come as a surprise, but it’s actually not that mysterious. Standard theory tells us that inflation occurs when demand outstrips supply and prices rise to adjust.\n\nSo, the question is less about why it’s happening and more about how long it will persist. Specifically, will it last beyond the pandemic? There are good reasons to think that it won’t. And I will focus on three of these reasons in particular—two related to demand and one related to supply.\n\nLet me start with demand. COVID has changed how and where we spend our money. Public health policies aimed at stopping the virus—lockdowns, social distancing, mask wearing—have kept us from going to the gym, seeing a movie, traveling, and using a host of other services. So we’ve taken to the internet and worked to recreate our normal lives at home. In economics parlance, we “rotated” spending, buying an outsized number of goods—things like home exercise equipment, video games, lawn furniture, and cars—while leaving behind spending on services.\n\nUnfortunately, the resilience of supply and supply chains have been far less robust. COVID-related disruptions have episodically depressed production across the globe. City by city, plants have shut down or reduced shifts to curb infections. These disruptions have accumulated and snowballed, leaving many goods in short supply.\n\nEven when goods are available, it’s been hard to get them delivered. Shipping containers are in the wrong places. Trucking networks are lagging. And ports across the globe are struggling to clear backlogs of ships waiting to dock and unload.\n\nAnd we’re not out of the woods yet. With lagging vaccination rates in many countries, shutting down is often the best way to fight surging infections. These policies, while necessary, leave a long imprint. In fact, a port closure in Vietnam in August meant to curb surging Delta infections continues to be felt up and down the supply chain.\n\nPutting all of this together, it’s easy to see why prices are rising. Consumers with income to spend have demanded more goods than usual and suppliers have struggled to keep up. But what does it mean for future inflation?\n\nGiven the factors boosting prices that I’ve just described, I expect a moderation in price pressures as the pandemic recedes. Consumers will likely pivot back to their normal bundles of goods and services—spending some time with their new home entertainment centers, but also going to movies, concerts, dinners and, hopefully, holiday parties.\n\nSimilarly, as fiscal support rolls off and many households move their savings back to historically normal levels, demand will likely become more in sync with the overall strength of the economy. Production and supply chains should also catch up and repair, reducing bottlenecks and easing the pressure on prices.\n\nAs these things happen, we should return to the typical dynamics that drive the economy.\n\nThe Labor Market\n\nBut what about the labor market? What’s its future?\n\nOn one hand, labor markets look tight. Unemployment is down, job openings are at all-time highs, and wages are up in many sectors. Help wanted signs are everywhere and workers are quitting at record levels. These are all things we typically see only when the economy is “hot” and we are nearing full employment.\n\nNow, some have speculated that this is the new normal—a great epiphany that work isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, so maybe we won’t work at all. While it’s hard to argue against epiphanies, I’ll offer a few alternatives.\n\nThese behaviors are understandable reactions to an unprecedented shock. As COVID recedes, I expect people to settle in, land a job they want, and return to the labor market to support their families and build a career.\n\nTo summarize, although inflation is high and the labor market seems tight, when we dig into the data, it’s easy to see that some of what we observe today reflects the ongoing effects of the pandemic. This makes it harder to conclude that we are facing a completely new world that will persist once the worst of COVID is behind us.\n\nGetting to the Economy We Want\n\nOf course, the truth is, none of us is completely certain how the economy will evolve. We can’t say for sure that the eye-popping rates of inflation won’t leave a more lasting imprint on overall price setting. And we don’t know how long it will take for sidelined workers to come back.\n\nAnd this is a hard place for policymakers. We have the tools to support the economy if it needs it, and we have the tools to beat back inflation and cool the labor market if necessary. The question is, which of these scenarios will turn out to be true?\n\nIn the face of this uncertainty, many have argued that we should act preemptively—get ahead of things, rather than fall behind the curve.\n\nThis logic has some appeal. If the high readings on inflation last long enough, they could seep into our psychology and change our expectations about future inflation. Households would then expect prices to keep rising and ask for higher wages to offset that. Businesses, of course, would pass those increases on to consumers in the form of higher prices, causing workers to ask for even higher wages. And on it would go, in a vicious wage-price spiral that would end well for no one.\n\nBut why not take out some insurance—preemptively raise rates to make sure that a painful inflation spiral doesn’t occur? The main answer is that preemptive action isn’t free. Like all insurance, there are costs. And policymakers must balance these costs against the risk of waiting.\n\nMonetary policy is a blunt tool that acts with a considerable lag. So, raising interest rates today would do little to increase production, fix supply chains, or stop consumers from spending more on goods than on services. But it would curb demand 12 to 18 months from now. Should current high inflation readings and worker shortages turn out to be COVID-related and transitory, higher interest rates would bridle growth, slow recovery in the labor market and unnecessarily sideline millions of workers.\n\nWith the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates, the Fed would have limited room to respond to this type of forecast mistake. On the other hand, if we hold rates steady and inflation persists, we can raise rates later on. This policy asymmetry makes the potential costs of acting prematurely disproportionately high.\n\nAgainst this calculus, I come down on the side of waiting to gain greater clarity. The Fed is well positioned to act should inflation begin to look more persistent. It’s much harder to unwind a preemptive action that turns out to be wrong.\n\nBut “not now” for interest rates does not mean “not ever” for policy. In fact, earlier this month, we announced that we will reduce the monthly pace of net asset purchases in response to substantial improvement in the economy from the depths of the recession. This will slow the amount of support we are adding to the economy, allowing it to function more on its own.\n\nOver the next several quarters, as tapering occurs, we will watch to see how the economy does and whether inflation eases and workers come back. As we get a clearer signal, we will be ready to act, continuing to provide or remove support as needed to ensure the economy settles at a sustainable place.\n\nThe Bravest Action We Can Take\n\nLet me leave you with a few concluding thoughts. As a policymaker and a person, I’m biased toward action. I like to solve problems. So, I understand the desire to immediately confront the challenges in front of us. Action gives us a sense of agency, especially at a time when it feels like we have none.\n\nBut not all motion is forward motion. Reacting in response to things that aren’t likely to last will move us farther from—not closer to—our goals. And while it’s easy to mistake motion for competence or action for attention, running headlong into a fog can be costly. So in the face of unprecedented uncertainty, the best policy is recognizing the need to wait. Although this can be hard, in the end, patience is the bravest action we can take.\n\nThank you.\n\nEnd Notes\n\nReferences\n\nDe Smet, Aaron, Bonnie Dowling, Marino Mugayar-Baldocchi, and Bill Schaninger. 2021. “‘Great Attrition’ or ‘Great Attraction’?

            "content": "As Americans, one of our most deeply held beliefs is that anyone, no matter where they come from or who they are, can make it. They just have to work hard and play by the rules. This assumption permeates our political system, our institutions and our economy.\n\nBut crises can be illuminating. The pandemic has shined a vivid light on the deep roots of economic inequity, forcing us to recognize that the rules aren’t the same for everyone. COVID has taken the most from the people and communities that are least able to bear it. And long standing gaps in economic opportunity and well-being have grown deeper and wider.\n\nAs humans, we are adaptive. We get used to things. We live a certain way for long enough, and we begin to believe that’s the way it’s supposed to be. We forget that the gaps we see every day reflect accumulated inequities—the long tail of policy, luck or inattention that has made it easier for some and harder for others to reach their potential. And then, an economy that leaves large numbers of people behind starts to seem normal.\n\nToday, I’m going to talk about why this way of looking at the world limits our potential, and how we can use the lessons of the pandemic to forge a more equitable society—one with fewer gaps and greater prosperity for all.\n\nBefore I go on, I’ll remind you that the views I will express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Bridle of Our Assumptions\n\nNow, before we imagine a more equitable world, it’s important to take stock of the one we have. Economists and many others generally assume that resources are allocated according to their most productive uses and that all available resources are fully deployed. Unless there is blatant market failure—collusion, discrimination or other obvious barriers to entry—we believe that any differences in initial conditions will smooth out over time. In other words, no matter where you are born or how you start out, the marketplace will ensure that you land where you’re supposed to be.\n\nAnd there are many examples of this being true. Amazing stories of people starting with little and doing a lot—confirming our belief that markets work efficiently and human capital is put to its best uses with few mistakes.\n\nBut this can be misleading. It can make us think that the world we have is all it could ever be. And this bridles our economy’s potential. It leaves countless people contributing less than their talents and interests would allow, sometimes sidelining them completely.\n\nGaps\n\nTo get a sense of what we stand to gain from building a world with few gaps, it’s useful to review what some of the disparities look like. Many groups fare less well than the averages we hear about each day. But disparities for Black Americans, many of whom bear the costs of both historical and current discrimination, are especially sizeable. So, their experiences are an important starting point.\n\nLeaving these gaps unaddressed is clearly unfair. But it’s also unproductive. It keeps millions of people on the sidelines or underutilized, and sells the economy short. No entrepreneur would ever stand for it. The question is, why do we?\n\nFrom Gaps to Growth\n\nOne reason is that we don’t fully understand what we’re missing. We don’t regularly calculate the losses from exclusion or the potential gains from being more inclusive—at least, not on an aggregate, economy-wide level. My colleagues and I recently did just that.\n\nWhen gaps are closed, the gains from equity are nearly $23 trillion over a 30-year period—a large piece of the economic pie unrealized or simply left on the table by tolerating the gaps that we see.\n\nThese and other studies make it clear that using all of our resources more fully improves aggregate prosperity. But the gains are likely to go beyond a boost in the level of GDP. Reducing disparities could also increase the economy’s long-run rate of growth.\n\nHis theory tells us that we can boost GDP growth by investing in strategies that foster the development and implementation of ideas. And not just of a few, but of everyone.\n\nThe bottom line is this: making sure everyone has a chance to generate and nurture their ideas is good for growth, and ultimately delivers greater prosperity to us all.\n\nSwitching Our Lens\n\nNow, I want to leave you with a story. A girl from a lower income family does well in school, reads a lot, likes to learn. But the family finances, and the family itself, fall on hard times. And the young girl, needing to assist, drops out of school. When she tells her teacher she is leaving, he doesn’t blink. He says he always knew that she wouldn’t amount to anything, and that her decision has just confirmed it.\n\nFast forward a few years, and the girl meets a woman named Betsy. And Betsy tells her that the job she wants, to drive a bus, requires a GED, and so do many others. So, the girl gets one. Then, Betsy tells her that many more jobs require college and she should go. And on it goes, until one day the girl—now a woman—earns a Ph.D. and heads off into the world to try and make a difference.\n\nThat girl, as you might have guessed, was me. And I tell you that story to show one thing: the lens we use determines what we do. My teacher and Betsy saw me differently. And because they saw me differently, they acted differently towards me. Betsy paid for my first semester of college. My teacher simply erased me.\n\nWe can take for granted that the outcomes we see today are inevitable, and watch as the pandemic makes existing gaps deeper and our prospects for future growth even slower. Or we can see them as a sign that resources aren’t being used to their fullest, and that people with great potential are being kept each day from realizing it.\n\nThe choice is clear. The will is ours.\n\nThank you.\n\nEnd Notes\n\nReferences\n\nAkee, Randall. 2021. “The Great Recession and Economic Outcomes for Indigenous Peoples in the United States.” Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 695(1), pp. 143-157.\n\nBengali, Leila, Mary C.

            "content": "This speech was posted on December 7, 2018.\n\nGood afternoon. I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you today. Most of my interactions with auto dealers are under more stressful circumstances. It’s a genuine pleasure to be meeting with you without any high-pressure talk about sticker prices and dealer costs, and no papers to sign.\n\nIn my comments, I’ll begin by discussing the current U.S. economic outlook, which by most reckonings is very good. And since I work for the organization that sets U.S. monetary policy, the Federal Reserve, or “the Fed” as it’s affectionately known, I’ll talk about that as well. As you know, interest rates have been going up, and that’s expected to continue. What may surprise you is just how little they’re expected to increase. This is guided by the intent of keeping the economic expansion going as long as possible. I’ll also talk about some longer-term economic challenges, specifically how technology has been changing the labor market, that monetary policy can only affect indirectly. I’ll be using a few slides and charts as guideposts, but not too many!\n\nBefore I proceed, I want to emphasize an important disclaimer: the views I express today are wholly my own and do not necessarily reflect those of other individuals or institutions in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nEconomic outlook\n\nI’ll start with the economic outlook. As I just mentioned, the U.S. economy is looking very good at the moment. The expansion is entering its 10th year. If it extends past June of next year, as widely expected, it will become the longest U.S. expansion in historical records dating back to the 1850s.1 The Great Recession from a decade ago is starting to fade from memory. Household and business balance sheets have been repaired, and there’s plenty of optimism fueling continued spending growth all around.\n\nWe typically assess the economy’s performance using a measure of overall activity, called gross domestic product, or GDP. It’s grown at a strong pace this year, and even though some slowing is expected, growth should remain quite healthy over the next few years.\n\nGDP is a good overall indicator, but it’s a bit opaque to the average person. Probably the clearest signs of the strong economy are in the labor market. Lots of new jobs are being created every month, and the unemployment rate has been running below 4 percent. This is the lowest it’s been since the 1960s. In other words, jobs are plentiful, and unemployed individuals to place in those jobs are becoming scarce. That can create challenges for employers, but from a broad economic perspective, it’s a situation that most people want to see continue.\n\nSustaining the expansion: An environment of rising interest rates\n\nThat’s where the Federal Reserve comes in. The goal of sustaining the expansion forms the backdrop for current and projected monetary policy.\n\nThe Fed has two main goals, as mandated by longstanding federal laws—this is the so-called dual mandate.\n\nThe first goal is maximum or full employment. That doesn’t mean everyone is working. Instead, it means a thriving labor market, with unemployment low enough that it largely reflects routine worker and job turnover. The low numbers I just mentioned strongly suggest that the labor market has not only reached but actually moved past full employment.\n\nThe Fed’s other goal is stable prices. In practice, this means a modest rate of inflation, specifically 2 percent.2 Inflation had been running below that target for much of the time since the Great Recession ended in 2009, but recently it has come back up and is basically on target.\n\nThese are not easy goals to achieve, especially when the Fed has only one main tool at its disposal: moving interest rates up and down. Low rates rev up the economy by stimulating borrowing, spending, and investment. High rates do the opposite, putting some brake pressure on the expansion. The Fed’s key policy rate is set by our monetary policy arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, which meets eight times per year. As I’m sure you know, the FOMC left rates at very low levels for a long time during and after the recession. This helped support the economic recovery.\n\nNow, with the targets largely met, and the economy able to stand on its own two feet, the Fed is well on the way to normalizing monetary policy. This means rising interest rates. The goal of this normalization process is to maintain the expansion and ensure that the Fed does not backslide on its dual mandate. If rates are left low, the economy could start running too hot, spurring an uptick in inflation. Recall that I mentioned the 1960s, another time when unemployment was very low. What was the aftermath? The 1970s, when, as I know from personal experience, rock music and fashion took a decided turn for the worse, and more importantly, inflation shot up to double digits.3\n\nThe problem with rapid increases in inflation is that they may require an aggressive monetary policy response, which can stifle the expansion. To minimize this risk and more generally keep the economy on an even keel, the FOMC has been raising interest rates over the past few years.\n\nBut here’s the really interesting part of the story. This process of raising rates has been occurring much more gradually than it did during recent economic expansions (see the first figure). For example, during the mid-2000s, the Fed’s policy rates rose by about 2 percentage points per year. By contrast, they’ve been rising half that pace or less during the current normalization cycle.\n\nInterest rates: Gradual, limited increase\nFederal funds rate (set by FOMC; with projections)\n\n\n\nThe economy already is seeing some impact from rising rates. This is mainly evident in the housing sector, where construction and sales have been easing this year. Of course, auto sales also depend heavily on borrowing, and they have slipped a bit over the past couple of years as well. Importantly, however, despite the restraining effects of higher rates for some sectors, the overall economic expansion has actually accelerated this year compared with 2017.\n\nIt’s also important to keep in mind that rates are not expected to rise anywhere near their past highs. This may be a pleasant surprise for you. The dashed line in the chart shows a likely path for the federal funds rate, based on the median projection in the FOMC’s most recent Summary of Economic Projections from late September.4 To be clear, these are only projections, not set plans. The FOMC has indicated that it will respond to changes in economic conditions accordingly. But if conditions evolve as expected, the funds rate is likely to top out at just under 3½ percent over the next few years, about 2 to 3 percentage points below its past highs. The reasons for these lower rates are complicated and would make for a separate talk in themselves.5 The key takeaway is that rates are likely to rise further but not by a lot.\n\nLong-term challenges: Technology and the labor market\n\nI’ve described a strong economy, in which the Fed’s main goals have largely been achieved. That’s the short of it. But all this happy talk often raises a question: if the economy is so good, why are some people feeling so bad? It’s a fair question. Many families, and in some cases entire communities, are struggling to make ends meet, and they are understandably baffled when people like me tell them that the economy is doing great.\n\nThe key longer-term challenges generally are coming from shifts in the labor market. And a key culprit is changing technology—by that, I mean the way work is organized, and the interactions between people and machinery that produce goods and services. Technology raises our standard of living in general, but it can be a major disrupter to the traditional economic order. With the expansion of computers and related technology, lots of jobs that used to be stable and well-paid are getting replaced by automation. This is well-known in manufacturing. But we also see this in a wide variety of services, from call centers to online retail and self-serve checkout at grocery stores. Auto dealers have been affected as well, although probably not as much—as far as I know, virtual reality test drives aren’t yet an adequate substitute for the real thing.\n\nEconomists refer to these shifts as job market polarization.6 This is the process by which changing technology and rising automation have been eroding the status of traditional middle-class jobs (depicted in the second figure). These so-called routine jobs are readily replaced by automation. Broadly speaking, this includes many white-collar sales and office jobs, as well as blue-collar factory jobs and related positions. These types of jobs have been disappearing over the past few decades, as shown by the gold and red bars in the chart. By contrast, the highly skilled professional positions have been doing well, as have lower-paying service positions that involve direct personal contact and hence are not routine—baristas and home health-care aides are basic examples, but there are lots of others.\n\nDisappearance of middle-class jobs\nEmployment growth by broad occupation category\n\n\n\nPolarization has had a profound impact on the job market. Wages have grown rapidly at the top, where workers tend to take advantage of the new technologies rather than being replaced by them. But those in the middle and below, who are competing for the same shrinking pool of jobs, generally have seen much slower gains.7\n\nRecent research conducted by myself and others suggests that polarization likely has contributed to lower labor force participation as well.8 This refers to the fraction of the working-age population that is either employed or actively looking for a job (in the third figure). You can see that the overall participation rate has declined during the past two decades. This occurred in part because the baby boom generation started heading off for retirement. But participation by individuals in their prime working years, between the ages of 25 and 54, also has declined. It has recovered somewhat but generally is expected to remain well below past highs.9 The disappearance of good middle-class jobs, without obvious and natural replacement jobs being created, has left large numbers of potential workers on the sidelines.\n\nLabor force participation has fallen\nLabor force participation rates\n\n\n\nAnd technology has affected the types of jobs available in other ways. Even with the labor market fully recovered from the Great Recession, there are still lots of workers who want to work full-time hours but are stuck in part-time jobs. My own research on this topic suggests that changing technology, reflected in job shifts toward industries that rely more heavily on unpredictable part-time schedules, has played a key role.10\n\nSimilarly, the growth of the gig economy reflects new technologies that have enabled ride-sharing services like Lyft and Uber to flourish. This is a great example of how new technologies can be a mixed bag. Gig jobs allow flexibility in work schedules and greater ability to supplement income, but they also lack traditional benefits and job security.\n\nAll this means that finding and staying in a well-paid job is not the same as it used to be. This makes for a challenging economic environment for workers and families buffeted by these changes, even when overall economic conditions are strong.\n\nWhere do the Fed and monetary policy come in? As I’ve argued, these challenges are largely created by changing technology and workplace practices, which monetary policy does not directly affect. But by keeping the expansion going, enabling job creation to continue and perhaps wages and job quality to improve, well-designed monetary policy can offset some of the negative impacts of these trends. Such challenges are easier to address when the economy is growing and the nation’s financial health is good, whether the solution is educational investments by households, training decisions by businesses, or spending decisions by government at all levels.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude, the United States economy is strong. The goal of monetary policy is to keep it strong by avoiding recessions without sparking unwanted inflation or other potential problems. This also helps create the best environment for addressing the challenges of a changing labor market. Thank you.\n\nEnd notes\n\n1. https://www.nber.org/cycles.html\n\n2.

            "content": "Introduction\n\nIn 1997 I was invited to give my first big presentation on the economy to the San Francisco Federal Reserve Board of Directors. It was a great success and many people came up to congratulate me afterwards. One of the most senior leaders at the bank appeared, slapped me on the back (spilling my coffee everywhere), and said, “That was amazing—I didn’t expect that.” He followed with, “You’re such a little tiny woman, who knew?” I don’t think he recognized what he was implying, but I did, and others did too, but in keeping with the mood of day, we laughed it off.\n\nIn the two decades since that event, I’ve given lots more presentations in many more venues, but the comments are often the same: “Wow, you surprised me.”\n\nBut I am no longer just laughing it off; instead, I’m asking, why? I’m an established economist, running a sizable research department, so why the amazement when I do or say something good. Apparently, it’s because I’m female, and relatively small.\n\nBefore I go any further, I should note that these comments are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of the San Francisco Fed or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nToday, I’m going to talk about how we need a new approach to the diversity crisis facing economics. If we’re going to encourage people to study and build careers in the field that we all love, we need to go beyond building the pipeline and fundamentally change the culture. I’m going to share with you why that’s the right way forward and discuss some of the work we’ve been doing at the San Francisco Fed, and across the entire Federal Reserve system, to shift the narrative, and the numbers, around diversity.\n\nMy sincere hope is that together, we can change our profession, so that when a woman, or anyone who looks different, stands up to speak, people expect it to be good and appreciate it when it’s great.\n\nThe data\n\nIn some ways it’s not surprising that people are shocked when they see a female economist present. For too long the number of women and minorities in economics has been stagnant.\n\nIn 1997 when I gave that first presentation, 28% of doctorate degrees were awarded to women, and 7% to minorities. That number has barely shifted, and more recently 31% go to women and 8% to minorities. The lack of progress is even more disappointing when we compare economics with other disciplines: The number of doctorate degrees awarded to women in STEM has increased from 42% in 1997 to more than 55% according to the latest data.1\n\nI’m sure that many of you in this room are familiar with the research produced last year by Alice H. Wu, a woman studying at University of California, Berkeley.2 Her senior thesis, “Gender Stereotyping in Academia: Evidence from Economics Job Market Rumors Forum,” documented the different language used to describe male and female economists on their message boards. Vocabulary used to describe men was related to intellect and career paths; vocabulary used to describe women, on the other hand, referred to appearance and was sexualized and objectifying.\n\nThe importance of inclusion\n\nI was deeply disturbed when the research was released—there is a moment of shock when you read it. I took the women in my department out to lunch to discuss their reactions and what we needed to do to keep women interested in economics despite such egregious revelations.\n\nTheir responses surprised me. What they described was not the overt sexism or extreme behavior that can be found on econjobrumors,3 but more a death by a thousand cuts: unfounded assumptions about career interests, unsolicited comments about appearance and behavior, and a general indifference towards whether they pursued economics or not.\n\nTo give an example, one colleague told me that on her first day on campus at an Ivy League college, the computer science department had a huge banner inviting women to learn more about what they had to offer. The other STEM subjects all had women’s resource groups and professional organizations, but the economics department had nothing. In fact, when she went to the economics department to inquire, they gave her a list of classes and told her to come back when she was done—not the enthusiastic welcome she was hoping for.\n\nThis is hugely concerning because the bottom line is, we’re all competing for the same minds. If engineering and IT departments are putting out the welcome mat and we’re not, that’s going to mean less diverse economists moving into the job market.\n\nBut when it comes to conversations about diversity in economics, the welcome mat too often doesn’t seem to have a role. What I hear is a paradigm that says our culture is fine, we just need to get more women into the pipeline, and eventually we’ll get a more diverse profession overall. This is despite the fact that we’ve been trying this approach for decades and we’re not moving the needle. The data are screaming that what we’re doing isn’t working, and yet we plow on regardless!\n\nWe’ve set up mentoring programs, we’ve published newsletters, and we’ve condemned bad behavior, and yet, women and minorities are not choosing to pursue careers in economics. I believe it’s because we’re asking people to fit a mold that they’re not comfortable with, rather than creating a culture where they feel welcome. We’re missing the “inclusion” part of diversity and inclusion. We’re not putting out the welcome mat and truly inviting them into our home.\n\nA culture of antagonism\n\nFrom my own experience, I know how constricting the culture can be. For years I was told to look and behave a certain way, so that I fit the norm of what it means to be an economist: “Tone down your enthusiasm, be more aggressive in your comments, be the first to interrupt when someone else is speaking!”\n\nRecently, I read an interview with the Princeton economist, Dr. Anne Case, and she said that, unlike economics, in other disciplines “the tenor of the seminars tends to be a lot less about scoring points and…trying to nail the speaker to the blackboard.”4 Her words really struck a chord because, when I compare going to an economics seminar with, for example, going to a computer science seminar (which I’ve done), one is super aggressive, while the other is super supportive. Which do you think does a better job at advancing science?\n\nThere are fixes for this. For example, at the San Francisco Fed, we’ve instituted a five-minute rule so that, when someone’s presenting, no one’s allowed to interrupt them for the first five minutes. My colleagues at the Board of Governors hired an outside consultancy to teach them how to run “safer” meetings and policy discussions so that all voices can be heard. These sound like small things, but they make a big difference because they signal that we’re here to create rich debate, rather than torpedo each other’s ideas.\n\nRewriting the rules\n\nSo what else can we do to change the culture, and the numbers, when it comes to economics?\n\nI hesitate to hold up tech companies and other university departments as role models when it comes to diversity and inclusion, because books like Brotopia,5 activists like Ellen Pao, and the glaring pay gap in academia6 all tell us that there are serious problems in Silicon Valley and research institutions alike. But because they’re also facing a lack of diversity in their ranks, there are things we can learn from their efforts to create change. The welcome groups on campus, the social media campaigns like #IAmAnEngineer, and the boot camps for diverse coders are starting to chip away at the diversity problem in STEM.\n\nWhat I find promising is the holistic approach these organizations are taking. They don’t just focus on one aspect of the issue; they use marketing, networking groups, and organized meet and greets to telegraph their interest and reinforce the commitment to recruit and retain diverse talent.\n\nCultural change at the San Francisco Fed\n\nA few years ago we set about investigating why female candidates for research assistant were, year after year, turning down our job offers at the San Francisco Fed. We were faced with the uncomfortable reality that their impression of the department was one of an old boys’ club.\n\nWe decided to roll out a campaign to better inform faculty and students about the inclusive work culture and diverse opportunities we offer.7 We sent letters to hundreds of colleges and universities, letting them know we were committed to increasing the female and minority representation in our department. And then I called every person we made an offer to and talked to them about the job. In short, we put out the welcome mat in a big way. At the end of the hiring cycle, the gender balance of male to female research assistants went from 80–20 to 50–50.\n\nTruth be told, it wasn’t easy. When we committed to increasing diversity, we got the usual objections: Standards will fall, targets are constraining, I know a good research assistant when I see one, etc., etc. Stripping these objections away and changing how we hired forced us to take a long, hard look at our internal culture and processes.\n\nOf course recruitment is just half the battle. It’s equally important to keep the conversation going. Being vocal about diversity and inclusion in forums like this and on social media sends a message, internally and externally, that these issues are important to the San Francisco Fed and the Federal Reserve System as a whole. Making sure I listen to what my staff are saying in the wake of Wu’s research, or the explosion of the #MeToo movement, helps us fine-tune our approach to the culture we’re creating.\n\nFinally, the whole team needs to be on board and understand the importance of change. A junior male colleague recently pointed out to me that visiting scholars are almost always escorted to our floor by a female staff person. He thought it was odd and demeaning, so we created a schedule to make sure that jobs like picking someone up from the lobby didn’t automatically fall to the junior females. I was encouraged when he raised the issue because it signaled that the mind-set of inclusion is starting to spread beyond the senior leaders.\n\nWhen I think back to that first presentation I gave to the San Francisco Fed Board of Directors, more than 20 years ago, the really troubling thing is that I don’t remember how well I did or the praise I got from colleagues. I remember the comment about my gender, and I remember the fact that I didn’t question it. More importantly, I remember that none of the senior colleagues standing next to me questioned it either.\n\nWhen it comes to creating cultural change, and preventing death by a thousand cuts, we can’t ask our junior women to shoulder the burden, but it’s absolutely something we can ask of ourselves and our institutions. It’s incumbent on all of us to use our voices to create both a more diverse and a more inclusive profession.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo sum up, we know there has been egregious, damaging behavior that needs to be taken very seriously. But if we want economics to be more diverse, we need to put our focus on the inclusion piece, too. We need to imagine what cultural change looks like in our organizations, put the wheels in motion, and then communicate those changes to the outside world. That’s how we’ll change the story, and the statistics, about the career that we all love.\n\nEnd notes\n\n1. Bayer and Rouse (2016).\n\n2. Wu (2017).\n\n3. econjobrumors\n\n4. Clement (2017).\n\n5.

            "content": "Introduction\n\nThank you for the kind introduction. It’s wonderful to be here in such beautiful surroundings. I always enjoy coming to Phoenix; the person who inspired me to pursue a career in economics lives here, and he’s also the reason I’m standing in front of you today. He said it’s important to do economics, but it’s even more important to share economics to advance a productive and vibrant society, and that’s what I hope to do with this talk.\n\nNow, before I get too far along with the sharing, let me say that my remarks are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nToday I’m going to talk about economic growth past, present, and future and shed some light on the factors holding back the pace at which we are likely to expand going forward. I’m also going to highlight some ways in which we can alter that path and achieve greater prosperity.\n\nCurrent economic conditions\n\nBefore I consider the future or even the past, I want to give you an overview of the economy’s current performance, and it’s good news: We’re in the third (soon to be the second) longest expansion in history. The labor market is booming, consumer and business spending are solid, and all the other key economic indicators are flashing green. An added boost is coming from a number of tailwinds, including supportive financial conditions, strong global growth, and the recent fiscal stimulus.\n\nThe national picture is reflected here in Arizona. If the airport is any indication things are good, especially in Phoenix. And as a whole, Arizona is adding jobs at a rapid clip, unemployment is low, and the housing market, so negatively affected in the aftermath of the financial crisis, is getting its legs back.\n\nSo overall, the U.S. economy is in good shape and the prospects are bright. We expect ongoing solid growth in coming years, with further tightening in labor markets and a gradual return of inflation to 2 percent. With the economy doing so well, it’s a good time to ask, what is the sustainable speed limit going forward?\n\nAverage GDP growth over the 60 years preceding the Great Recession, was just under 3.5 percent. But if we look ahead, economists forecast numbers closer to 2 percent. The economic pie is going to grow at nearly half the speed we’re used to. In the remainder of my time, I want to take a step back and talk about why growth is forecast to be slower than what we’ve seen in previous expansions and what we might do about it. The data reveal answers that may be surprising, but nonetheless they are ones we must contend with if we are to create a more prosperous future.\n\nDrags on future growth\n\nSo how did we go from an economy with a speed limit of 3.5 percent to one bridled by a number closer to 2 percent? Many potential candidates make the news: excessive regulation, taxes, lack of competitiveness, etc. And all of those play some role in shaping our future. But in the end, none of them can really account for the dramatic change in prospects we see. To explain that, we need to look at the fundamental drivers of economic growth: growth in productivity and the labor force.\n\nAnd here, the data tell the story. The chart shows the contributions to GDP growth from 1950 to 2025. The data come from the Congressional Budget Office1, the organization responsible for supporting policymakers in budgeting. The dark blue sections of the bars represent potential labor force growth and the light blue sections represent potential productivity growth. What this shows us is that productivity growth has varied over time, but since the 1980s has contributed on average about 1.5 percent to growth and is forecast to do the same going forward.\n\nSlow labor force growth hinders GDP growth\n\n\n\nThe pattern for labor force growth is quite a bit different. In the 1970s, labor force growth alone contributed 2.7 percentage points to GDP growth, meaning that even if productivity growth had been zero, the economy would have expanded at 2.7 percent, slightly faster than the pace of our current expansion. Since that peak, labor force growth has come down substantially. As the forecast for 2025 shows, labor force growth is expected to remain stuck at 0.5 percent for the next decade. This means that, absent a surge in productivity, slow growth in the labor force will be a restraining factor on the U.S. economic speed limit.\n\nWhere have the American workers gone?\n\nWhere have all the workers gone? Demographics play a big role in labor force growth, and at the moment many baby boomers are heading off for retirement. At the same time, the fertility rate has slowed: Put simply, people are having fewer babies. Together, these two factors explain a large share of the changes in labor force growth displayed in the graph. Notably, the United States is not unique in these respects. Population aging is a global phenomenon, and many industrialized nations have seen their birth rates fall.\n\nBut these trends don’t explain everything. We’ve also seen a drop in the level of labor force participation among workers in their prime employment years, a pattern that does look quite a bit different from other countries.\n\nU.S. labor participation rate declining\n\n\n\nLabor force participation in the United States for prime-age workers reached a peak in the late 1990s and then took a steep dive in the 2001 recession. In the 2007 recession, it took an even steeper tumble, reaching a low point in 2015, nearly eight years after the initial downturn. While we have seen improvements since, they have been modest. So today, the share of men and women in their prime working years who are employed or actively searching for a job is far lower than it was in the 1990s.\n\nWhat’s really interesting in these data is that, unlike the trends for retirement and fertility, this one is unique to the United States. We don’t see the same thing happening in other advanced economies.\n\nThis chart compares the percentage of prime-age workers in the labor force in Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In these other advanced economies, labor force participation of prime-age workers has increased overall and now stands far—several percentage points—above the rates observed in the United States.\n\nU.S. diverging from international trends\n\n\n\nWhich raises the question—why aren’t American workers working?\n\nThe answer is not simple, and numerous factors have been offered to explain the decline in labor force participation. Research by a colleague from the San Francisco Fed and others suggests that some of the drop owes to wealthier families choosing to have only one person engaging in the paid labor market.2 And I emphasize paid here, since the other adult is often staying at home to care for house or children, invest in the community, or pursue education. Whatever the alternative activity, some of the lost labor market participation seems related to having the financial ability to make work–life balance choices.\n\nAnother factor behind the decline is ongoing job polarization that favors workers at the high and low ends of the skill distribution but not those in the middle. I know for myself, I never call a travel agent anymore. With a few taps and swipes on my phone, I can book a trip to almost anywhere in the world in seconds. But it goes far beyond that: Our economy is automating thousands of jobs in the middle-skill range, from call center workers, to paralegals, to grocery checkers.\n\nA growing body of research finds that these pressures on middle-skilled jobs leaves a big swath of workers on the sidelines, wanting work but not having the skills to keep pace with the ever-changing economy.3\n\nThe final and perhaps most critical issue I want to highlight also relates to skills: We’re not adequately preparing a large fraction of our young people for the jobs of the future. Like in most advanced economies, job creation in the United States is being tilted toward jobs that require a college degree.4 Even if high school-educated workers can find jobs today, their future job security is in jeopardy. Indeed by 2020, for the first time in our history, more jobs will require a bachelor’s degree than a high school diploma.5\n\nThese statistics contrast with the trends for college completion. Although the share of young people with four-year college degrees is rising, in 2016 only 37 percent of 25- to 29-year-olds had a college diploma.6 This falls short of the progress in many of our international competitors,7 but also means that many of our young people are underprepared for the jobs in our economy.\n\nSo where should we focus our efforts when it comes to getting more young people into college? One place to start is in working to equalize educational attainment across students of different races and ethnicities.\n\nAs the slide shows, the lion’s share of young Americans of Asian descent complete a four-year college degree. A smaller but still sizable share of white Americans, about 45 percent, also get a degree. The numbers drop off dramatically from there. Less than 25 percent of black and Hispanic young people go on to complete a college diploma.8 This is troubling from an equal opportunities perspective, but it’s also incredibly bad news for the economy, both today and certainly in the future. Our population is growing increasingly diverse: By 2024, just short of 40 percent of our labor force will be ethnicities other than white and Asian.9\n\nRoom to grow\n\n\n\nGiven the important role that education plays in labor force participation, employment, and wages, equalizing the educational attainment across these groups has big benefits for the economy.\n\nFaster growth through human capital\n\nThe really good news is that education is generally a win–win, beneficial to individuals and to taxpayers. We know that those with a college degree are much more likely to become top earners during their career, regardless of their financial background.10 They have lower unemployment rates, and they’re less likely to become unemployed during a recession. And while there’s no doubt the cost of college is a strain for many, the average time it takes to recoup that cost is 10 years.11 This means that, relative to many other investments, education pencils out, even if graduates don’t go on to earn top salaries.\n\nFor taxpayers the math is even more straightforward. A detailed study by the OECD shows that college is a great investment for taxpayers.12 The costs paid to educate are more than covered by increased productivity, longer and more stable work lives, and higher tax revenues from graduates.\n\nIn the parlance of economics, education is incentive compatible, good for everyone involved.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo wrap up, the U.S. is facing a future of slow growth, a “new normal.” But it doesn’t have to be that way. The United States has considerable room to run in actively engaging working age people in the labor market. Investing on this front is a lever we can pull that changes the fundamentals of economic growth and gives us an opportunity to raise the speed limit.\n\nEnd notes\n\n1.

            "content": "Introduction\n\nGood afternoon. I greatly appreciate the opportunity to share with you my perspectives on U.S. financial regulatory developments related to fintech. Before I begin, I’d like to congratulate the Shanghai Financial Institute and the other sponsors for hosting such a successful event, and also express my thanks for inviting me to join you. In addition, I’d like to preface my remarks by noting that the views and opinions I express today are solely my own, and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco or any other part of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI am sure that many of us share the view that technology is a dynamic and increasingly important part of the financial system in the United States and throughout the world. Through advances in mobile technology, cloud computing, data aggregation and other fields, fintech presents opportunities to expand and improve the way financial services are delivered. While entrepreneurs, traditional banks, and tech companies are at the forefront of fintech, financial regulators also have an important role in fintech development. As regulators, I believe our principal responsibility is to ensure that supervised institutions are operated safely and soundly and comply with applicable laws, including treating consumers fairly. Within that framework, however, we also have a strong interest in permitting socially beneficial innovations to flourish, and also in ensuring that the risks are appropriately managed. In this vein, financial authorities in the U.S. and many parts of the world are developing ways to appropriately adapt regulatory and supervisory structures relative to changing technologies and business models.\n\nTo help put the U.S. regulatory response in context, I will first provide a brief overview of the U.S. fintech industry, and outline the U.S. financial regulatory structure. Afterwards, I’ll discuss some of the steps that U.S. regulators have taken to address fintech matters. Finally I’ll conclude with some thoughts on continuing opportunities and challenges in U.S. fintech regulation.\n\nU.S. Fintech Industry\n\nThere are three kinds of fintech business models and structures in the United States today. The first model involves technology firms that provide financial services directly to customers through the use of mobile platforms and other innovations. They can be attractive to some customers because they often have comparatively faster decision times for certain financial products. They are also attractive in many cases because of their emphasis on convenience and the overall customer experience. These fintech firms do not rely on banks to deliver their products and services, and often compete directly with banks and other traditional financial institutions. In many ways, I think of this model as the “original concept” behind fintech, but as I’ll explain further, the number of U.S. fintech firms that operate under this model is low and seems to be decreasing.\n\nThe second model covers banks and other traditional financial services providers which have adapted and developed fintech solutions to improve the delivery of their financial services. Some of these banks are offering products comparable to those found at fintech firms. Some banks are researching and developing financial technologies themselves, while others find it more convenient and cost effective to turn to their core processors, software providers and other firms for such services.\n\nThe third model involves partnerships and similar relationships between nonbank fintech firms and traditional banks to deliver financial services. This model often combines the innovation and user experience focus of fintech firms with the risk management skills, deep customer relationships and other strengths of traditional banks. For example, many fintech marketplace lenders handle the consumer-facing loan application process and investor-facing funding process, but rely on a bank partner to handle loan decisions, originations and initial loan funding. Likewise, digital payment and wallet firms have designed attractive and convenient mobile applications for customers to transfer funds as well as pay for goods and services. Such firms ultimately rely on banks to clear and settle payments on traditional bank payment systems, including the automated clearing house (referred to as ACH) and the credit and debit card networks. This partnership model has taken on increased prominence in recent years in the U.S. as many fintech firms move away from emphasizing disruption and towards greater collaboration with banks.\n\nU.S. Regulatory Structure\n\nSo, now that we’ve talked a little about the structure of the fintech industry, I’ll turn to the structure of U.S. financial regulation. As with many countries, the U.S. does not have a single fintech license or regulatory agency. Rather, fintech activities fit within the broader framework of financial regulation and thus can be conducted by companies subject to a variety of regulators, either at the state or federal level.\n\nThe U.S. model of financial regulation spans both functional and consolidated supervisors and balances elements of centralized and federated authority. In this regard, many nonbank financial activities like lending, money transmission and insurance are primary regulated by the 50 individual states for prudential and licensing matters. The securities and banking industries are jointly regulated by multiple federal agencies and the 50 states (and in the securities industry, industry self-regulation plays an important role as well). Cutting across multiple industry types, the federal government has taken a leading role in regulating and supervising for consumer financial protection matters, although many states also play an important role. Finally, while the U.S. doesn’t have an explicit payment systems regulatory structure, the Federal Reserve through its role in operating and setting standards for certain major payment systems plays an important role too.\n\nSo how does this regulatory structure work in real life? Let’s take a hypothetical fintech company that wants to engage in lending and money transmission. Lending companies and money transmitters are regulated at the state level—so a non-bank fintech company that chooses to engage in either activity will generally need to get a separate license for and be subject to differing rules in each state in which it conducts business. Many fintech and other nonbank financial services companies have expressed concern about the operational and legal challenges associated with having up to 50 different simultaneous regulators.\n\nThat same fintech company might consider the regulatory structure for banks. Relatively speaking, U.S. banks have a more consolidated regulatory model—banks can elect between varying federal or state charters and supervisors but all banks will have a primary federal regulator and in the case of state banks a single state regulator as well. While some overlap still exists, the U.S. regulatory model for banks provides for a more uniform set of rules and supervisory processes for nationwide operations than compared to nonbank fintech firm. Moreover, banks have privileges unavailable to nonbank fintech firms including deposit insurance, nationwide lending powers, and access to bank payment systems. Of course, with such unified supervision and privileges comes a higher level of prudential, conduct and other regulation than a nonbank fintech firm may be ready for. Moreover, depending on the structure and size of the bank, a variety of other federal and state agencies may continue to regulate other activities of the bank or its affiliates including insurance, investment broker/dealer and advisory services as well as consumer protection compliance.\n\nWhile not many fintech firms have opted to become or acquire banks, thus subjecting themselves to direct bank supervision, many banks and fintech firms (as I noted before) are partnering to offer financial services. In this model, the fintech firm is usually still required to obtain all necessary licenses and remain subject to supervision from state regulatory authorities. Meanwhile, the bank remains subject to supervision from federal and state banking authorities. In addition, if the fintech firm is providing any services to the bank or its customers, the bank in many cases remains responsible for the services the fintech firm is providing. U.S. federal banking regulators have enacted third-party risk management guidance for banks specifying due diligence, audit, ongoing monitoring and other standards to guide banks in such relationships. In addition, fintech firms that provide certain kinds of services to banks may in some cases also be subject to direct examination by the federal banking supervisors.\n\nAs you can imagine, the structure of the U.S. regulatory system impacts fintech firm operating models—there would likely be more nonbank fintech firms directly competing with traditional banks if not for the difficulties involved in 50-state licensing. The supervisory requirements for banks also likely limit the number of fintech firms considering bank charters. Moreover, the large and increasing number of fintech/bank partnerships seems to reflect industry efforts to leverage the latest developments offered by technology firms with the established customer base, regulatory compliance experience and lending and payment capabilities of banks.\n\nLikewise, I think it is also important to keep the U.S. regulatory structure in mind when considering the fintech steps taken by U.S. agencies. The distributed nature of U.S. regulatory authorities means that multiple agencies may have a stake in considering certain fintech matters. It also means that new guidance and programs will often come from multiple agencies and in some cases may have narrower application than comparable measures from jurisdictions with more centralized authorities.\n\nU.S. Financial Regulatory Response\n\nNow that I’ve given you a high-level summary of the U.S. fintech and regulatory structure, I’d like to focus on some of the fintech-related steps that U.S. financial supervisors have taken. Regulators and jurisdictions in many parts of the world have taken fintech-related actions, including the establishment of innovation hubs, sandboxes, new chartering and passporting measures, and clear regulatory authorities including direct guidance. We may not always use the same terminology, but fintech steps by U.S. regulators are generally proceeding along the same model.\n\nU.S. financial supervisors are establishing programs similar to “innovation hubs” to help answer regulatory questions raised by new applications of technology. Through programs like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Project Catalyst, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s Office of Innovation, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission LabCFTC program, these agencies provide channels through which fintech firms and traditional financial services firms can communicate with the agency on fintech matters including through “office hour” type meetings.1 These efforts usually include dedicated agency staff who are knowledgeable on and serve as points of contact for the fintech industry. In this vein, I’d also like to mention the SF Fed’s recently launched Fintech Navigate program.2 We welcome all opportunities to communicate with interested fintech firms, banks and related parties.\n\nSecond, U.S. financial regulators have also begun to address and consider some of the chartering and licensing considerations in the fintech space. One example is New York State’s “BitLicense” program which establishes a special licensing and oversight program for companies engaged in virtual currency activities.3 Highlighting the diversity of outcomes that can be explored in the U.S. regulatory model, the States of Texas and Illinois have exempted many virtual currency activities from state money transmission licensing requirements.4 Another example of action in the chartering space is the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s proposed fintech-oriented special purpose national bank charter.5 However, I won’t comment further on the proposal as it is the subject of ongoing litigation filed by state regulators against the Comptroller of the Currency. Finally, the state banking and other financial supervisors have announced their Vision 2020 initiative, one of the goals of which is to establish a 50-state integrated licensing and supervisory system—while still in its early stages, this measure seems aimed at addressing some of the same cross-jurisdictional issues that have, in part, given rise to fintech “passporting” efforts under consideration in the EU.6\n\nAt the same time, U.S. financial regulators have expanded upon current guidance, and are considering further measures to address matters of interest to fintech firms and their partners. One area of particular recent activity relates to vendor or service-provider type relationships between banks and third parties. For example, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has issued proposed guidance on third party lending arrangements.7 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has recently clarified its Third Party Relationship Risk Management guidance which addresses the kinds of due diligence and other steps that national banks should take when they seek to obtain services from third-parties.8 Lastly, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has recently announced it has begun examining certain service providers to financial institutions, although this program seems to be initially focused on the home mortgage industry.9\n\nU.S. regulators have also considered fintech-related policy and related matters besides third-party relationships. Many fintech firms and banks use consumer financial and other data to help design and provide financial services. In late 2016, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sought public comments on consumer access to financial account and account-related data, including access by entities acting with consumer permission, in connection with the provision of products or services that make use of that information.10 Aside from data access, some fintech firms and other institutions are considering potential uses of alternative data, by which I mean information beyond traditional factors like credit scores, in making lending decisions. In that vein, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also sought information from the industry and broader public about the use or potential use of alternative data and modeling techniques in the credit process.11 Finally, I’d also like to note that the Federal Reserve, outside of our role as a financial regulator, has taken steps in the payments space that may be of interest to the fintech industry, such as facilitating task forces on faster and more secure payments and separately conducting research on distributed ledger technology.12\n\nOpportunities and Challenges\n\nAt this point, I’d like to turn to some areas where I see further opportunities and challenges for U.S. regulators and the fintech industry.\n\nThe first area is engagement. As I’ve mentioned, certain regulators have established programs or informal mechanisms to communicate and interact with the fintech industry. I would like to see greater expansion and use of such programs. Communication is key, and given the number of agencies involved, one of the most important steps for the fintech industry is to take advantage of the initiatives we already have underway or establish in the future. The reality of the U.S. regulatory model is that fintech firms and other industry players will often need active exchanges of information with multiple financial supervisors to smoothly employ new technology.\n\nThe second area that I’d like to see regulators devote some more thinking on, and the topic of an upcoming panel at this summit, is “Regtech,”—by which I mean exploring how regulators and the industry can use technological innovations in areas such as automation and machine learning to make regulatory compliance and oversight processes more effective and efficient. I’ve seen some promising developments in the area of anti-money laundering compliance, and believe that further opportunities exist in areas like risk management and consumer protection compliance. At least one agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, has made exploring the use of innovation in supervisory processes a part of their fintech goals—I hope more U.S. regulators will take similar steps and look forward to discussing this topic at greater length at the upcoming panel.\n\nFinally, I’d like to see regulators and industry focus on fintech considerations as they relate to traditional community banks and other smaller financial institutions. Community institutions are an important part of the American banking and financial system, especially in light of their role in providing small business credit. In some cases, community banks may face cost, operational or other challenges in adopting innovative technologies, especially when compared to larger institutions. As some bankers have noted, institutions slow to adopt digital offerings may find that they face longer-term challenges in light of changing customer expectations. While I recognize that not every community bank needs to immediately transform its offerings, I hope that institutions will continue to consider appropriate opportunities to adopt new technologies consistent with their business model and sound risk management practices. Given that many community banks and other institutions work with service providers to incorporate new technologies into their offerings, I hope that more U.S. regulators will consider appropriate clarifications to existing third-party risk management guidance to address measures which may be unintentionally impeding community banks from adopting beneficial technologies.\n\nThat concludes my prepared remarks. Thank you again for the opportunity to speak today, and I look forward to the remainder of this summit and your questions.\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1.

            "content": "More often than not, most people think of the nation’s central bank on a national level when it comes to monetary policy—the Board of Governors and the Federal Open Market Committee, for example. What often gets overlooked is the Fed’s engagement on a regional and local level.\n\nFirst, a little bit of background on the structure of the Federal Reserve System. The Fed is independent within the U.S. government, but not independent of it. From an organizational standpoint, the Board of Governors in Washington D.C. represents the public, or government side of the Fed. There are seven board members, headed by chair Janet Yellen, and a staff of over 2,000 employees. Among other things, the Board oversees the 12 Regional Reserve Banks.\n\nThe Regional Banks represent the private side of the Fed. They are separately incorporated and operate much like any private corporation, but for the public good. The 12 Regional Banks are tasked with carrying out much of the day-to-day activities of the Fed and this Regional Bank structure is why the Fed is often referred to as a decentralized central bank.\n\nThe San Francisco Fed oversees the 12th Federal Reserve District, by far the largest geographically of the Regional Banks. It encompasses the nine western states, including Alaska and Hawaii, plus American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The District’s size is due in large part to the lack of population in the western states when District boundaries were established in 1913. Much has changed since 1913 and today approximately 20% of the U.S. population resides in the 12th District. The same can be said for U.S. personal income, nonfarm payroll employment and manufactured exports.\n\nThe Economic Research staff at the San Francisco Fed works diligently to understand current economic trends nationally and within the 12th District as well as trying to anticipate what’s to come. Needless to say, there’s no shortage of data and models, but such information becomes more meaningful when coupled with real-time input from a local level. Enter the boards of directors.\n\nPotential directors are identified mostly through the time honored tradition of building a network of long term relationships both directly and indirectly. As Regional Executive at the Seattle Branch, I regularly meet with business and community leaders in Washington and Alaska. These meetings primarily provide an opportunity to build rapport and exchange information on a host of economic related topics. In turn, they may serve as a precursor for future director consideration. It’s a continuous process as directors have staggered terms while serving a maximum of two three-year terms.\n\nThe Head Office and each of the four branches in the San Francisco District have a board of directors. The main contribution of board members is to provide observations on what’s happening in their areas of expertise and the economy in general. It’s important to note, that when commenting on economic conditions, directors often reference information from other business and community leaders they’ve been in contact with during a particular month. In this way, a larger and more diverse picture of the economy is provided that spans well beyond those seated in the board room.\n\nEach board meets once per month and members submit reports based on questions that are distributed two weeks earlier by the Economic Research department. A Bank economist attends each board meeting and provides a presentation on the economic outlook and answers any questions. Lastly, information provided by the directors is forwarded to the Economic Research department in the form of a summary from each office as well as individual reports.\n\nI see this process firsthand every month and hear the varied and valuable insights our board members have to offer. There is a concerted effort to ensure that we have a variety of industries and organizations represented across the Seattle zone which encompasses Washington and Alaska. The economy doesn’t end at the edge of the Seattle/King County Metro area and it can look very different the further away you get. Currently, four of our seven board members are from outside of the Seattle area. At times, location isn’t necessarily a critical driver because many of the companies have a regional, national and even international presence to draw upon.\n\nIn the end, the contributions board members make to the monetary policy process ensures the local perspective is not lost among the macroeconomic data. There are stories to be told, stories that our President, John Williams, takes note of when preparing for FOMC meetings every six weeks in Washington D.C."

            "content": "Financial technology (fintech) continues to change the dynamics of banking and how financial products and services are delivered to consumers. This digitization of financial services has a nexus with a wide range of our responsibilities at the Federal Reserve, including promoting financial stability, safe and sound financial institutions, and consumer protection. Given our proximity to Silicon Valley, where a number of these new innovations are occurring, the SF Fed has established a small team of fintech analysts to study market developments from a financial institution supervision perspective, to engage in industry outreach and to help build technical expertise among supervisors.\n\nIn recent remarks, I touched on the fintech work underway inside the Federal Reserve where a team of supervisors are studying fintech developments to understand the range of risks and opportunities and develop recommendations for a broader Federal Reserve response.\n\nTo ensure that we have a broad-based understanding of new innovations in financial services, our team is working with colleagues throughout the Federal Reserve System and is engaging in dialogue with other U.S. and foreign banking regulatory agencies. I received a number of questions about the current OCC proposal to make a special purpose national bank charter available to fintech firms, and noted that the Federal Reserve is engaged in dialogue with the OCC in those areas where the Fed has a role. Specifically, the OCC’s proposal raises interpretive and policy issues for the Federal Reserve that include Fed membership, access to Fed accounts and services, and whether or not firms receiving these charters would meet the definition of a bank under the Bank Holding Company Act. If the OCC proposal is finalized, Federal Reserve staff will have to closely analyze these issues with respect to fintech firms that express an interest in moving forward with an application.\n\nAs part of my comments, I announced that the San Francisco fintech team is available to meet with fintech firms or other industry participants to help them understand and navigate the U.S. regulatory system. Team members can be contacted by email at SFFed Fintech. One of the first questions we are routinely asked is where start-ups and others engaging in new financial services can go for input to help understand existing regulatory requirements.\n\nI also noted that the Fed’s work in fintech is driven by the idea that appropriately designed innovation, which in our view includes strong risk management and consumer protections, holds great potential to benefit consumers and small businesses.\n\nOur hope is that by engaging with industry participants we can help them navigate a complex regulatory system and provide the necessary education to industry participants to meet the requirements of existing financial regulation.\n\nYou may also be interested in:"

            "href": "https://www.frbsf.org/news-and-media/speeches/leadership/2017/02/work-health-and-insurance-an-evolving-relationship",
            "content": "The relationship between work and health is complex and in flux. Employers rely on healthy employees for business operations. Those same employers play an important role in the U.S. health care system through the widespread provision of health insurance. Even with the recent profound changes in the health insurance landscape, notably provisions of the 2010 federal Affordable Care Act (ACA) that expanded insurance access, over half of all Americans still receive health insurance through a job held by themselves or a family member. At the same time, the relationship between work, health, and insurance is affected by evolving workforce characteristics. Important changes include shifting demographics, most importantly the aging of the labor force, and the changing nature of employment relationships, including rising part-time work and the growth of the “gig” economy of on-demand workers.\n\nIn a recent research publication, Professor Thomas C. Buchmueller of the University of Michigan and I assess these trends (presented at the Health Affairs journal events on February 7 and February 22, 2017). We provide basic numbers on the changing labor market and health insurance landscape from 2000 to 2015, and we also discuss a wide range of research on the evolving links between work, health, insurance, and public policies such as the ACA.\n\nGiven the Federal Reserve’s research focus on monetary policy and the overall macro-economy, why is the Fed interested in this subject? In fact, it relates directly to our core mission: achieving the Fed’s “dual mandate” of price stability and maximum employment requires sustained economic growth, which in turn relies on a healthy, expanding workforce. Moreover, employee health benefits are a large cost for employers, affecting overall compensation pressures and progress toward the dual mandate goals.\n\nWhat are the key takeaways from this research (see the published piece for details)?\n\n(1) Demographic changes, in particular the aging of the workforce, are putting upward pressure on employers’ health insurance costs. This occurs automatically because health care spending generally is higher for older age groups. Rising costs may further undermine the dominance of employer-sponsored insurance: the share of the U.S. population covered via employers fell from a peak of about 65% in the year 2000 to about 56% in 2015 (albeit with unexpected stability between 2010 and 2015).\n\n(2) Changing employment arrangements and wage patterns probably contributed to the declining availability of workplace health insurance. These changes include the shift to part-time work and the growth of the gig economy, along with wage stagnation for lower-paid workers. Since health insurance benefits generally are restricted to full-time payroll employees for cost and tax reasons, and are most common among well-paid workers, these shifts will tend to reduce insurance availability on the job.\n\n(3) These workforce changes have coincided with deteriorating health indicators and increased work limitations. A rising fraction of working-age individuals are on permanent disability. Also, recent research points to chronic pain and consequent use of pain medication as factors contributing to the shrinking share of prime-age adults (25-54) in the labor force.\n\n(4) Adverse working conditions, notably job instability and inflexibility, can undermine health. The rise of the gig economy may provide greater flexibility in hours worked, but if workers are pushed toward such arrangements due to economic stress, this may compromise health.\n\n(5) There are no silver bullets for reducing employer health benefit costs. These costs generally have been rising faster than overall inflation, implying a growing cost burden for employers. To combat these increases, many employers have embraced “wellness” strategies that give employees incentives to make lifestyle changes that may reduce costly chronic conditions. The ACA included provisions that encourage such programs, but their effectiveness at reducing health costs, as well as their legal status in some settings, remain at issue.\n\n(6) Health policies cannot reverse broader trends in the labor market, but they can play an important role in mediating the impact of these trends on workers’ well-being. By creating new health insurance options that are not tied to full-time employment, the ACA may have helped to mitigate some of the factors undermining insurance availability. With some of its key provisions now up for renewed debate, it remains to be seen what policies will be in place to enhance access to affordable, non-employment based insurance coverage."

            "content": "Good morning and welcome. It’s always a pleasure to speak to the WIB. As I’m sure you know, the Federal Reserve has had a long relationship with the WIB and remains committed to supporting your priorities in providing education and training to bankers in the West.\n\nToday I thought that I’d share a few issues that have been on my mind lately: a supervisory issue unique to smaller institutions, an emerging trend with the potential to impact banks of all sizes, and a concept that is highly relevant to banks’ success in managing risk.\n\nAs always, I should pause here to note that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWith that out of the way…\n\nTailoring\n\nThe first thing I want to address is how we at the Federal Reserve are working to tailor the requirements of Dodd-Frank and other laws and regulations to the risks and profiles of smaller banks.\n\nCommunity banks are important. They’re the cornerstones of communities across the country and reach people who might otherwise wind up underbanked or even fully excluded from the system, particularly in rural areas. Because community banks know their customers and understand local economies, they’re often able to extend credit to those who might otherwise be denied. In short, community banks hold a unique position in our country. They also face unique challenges.\n\nAn obvious one is responding to new laws and regulations, and there has been a cascade of these following the financial crisis. It’s important to note that most of the new requirements have been designed for large, complex, and interconnected institutions, with the goal of addressing the serious weaknesses that contributed to the crisis. That said, a number of those requirements have, or are perceived to have, trickled down unintentionally to smaller institutions, causing much uproar from community bankers.\n\nWe hear you. Clearly, a one-size-fits-all approach won’t work for supervision. We know that subjecting small banks to large bank supervision would threaten your ability to operate and put at risk the many benefits that community banks provide to customers and our economy. All the regulators, including the Fed, are deeply committed to reducing unnecessary and unintended burden on community banks.\n\nAt the national level, the banking agencies review regulations every 10 years under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act, which has the melodious acronym EGRPRA. The purpose of this review is to identify outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome regulations and consider how to reduce regulatory burden while simultaneously ensuring the safety and soundness of individual banks and the financial system as a whole. The agencies conducted the most recent review through a series of six outreach meetings and four notices for public comment. I’m particularly pleased that the first outreach event was held in our district, in Los Angeles. There, we heard concrete and useful suggestions, including reducing the time it takes to process applications, raising the asset threshold for a longer exam cycle, streamlining examination processes, revisiting appraisal requirements, rethinking community bank capital requirements, and more. The agencies are now considering all of the comments, with a bias toward action, and will issue a final report to Congress that summarizes the key issues, reports on actions already taken, and identifies the need for regulatory or legislative changes.\n\nHowever, we at the Fed are not waiting for the final report to take action. We strongly supported and promptly implemented two recent Congressional actions to right-size our supervisory rules. This included expanding the number of institutions covered by the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement, raising the asset threshold from $500 million to $1 billion and expanding coverage to an additional 700 bank and savings and loan holding companies. Importantly, this exempts them from consolidated regulatory capital requirements, which means a reduction in both the cost of capital and reporting requirements. Second, we quickly expanded eligibility for an 18-month exam cycle to well capitalized and well managed banks with assets up to $1 billion. That benefitted an additional 600 banks nationwide.\n\nThe Fed understands that regulations need to keep pace with changes in the industry, but we’re also deliberate in how that’s done. Changes are on the horizon. It will take a bit of time to fully assess the comments we received and to be sure we’ve got it right. But please know that it’s a priority, and your voices are being heard at the national level.\n\nIn addition to these national efforts, we are taking steps in the San Francisco Reserve Bank to address the burden issues that you have raised. Take, for example, our exams. We work closely with our state colleagues to carefully monitor the number of examiners that we send to your institutions and calibrate our approach on a case-by-case basis. We don’t have one single program for every bank; instead we adjust our supervisory activities to the level of risk, to the size, and to the complexity of the organization. It’s obviously a waste of time and an undue burden to treat, say, a small community bank in the California Central Valley the same way we’d look at a regional institution with branches in many states.\n\nAnother example is stress-testing. We expect banks that have lending or funding concentrations to undertake scenario analyses to identify vulnerabilities – that’s just sound risk management. We don’t, however, hold smaller institutions to large bank stress test requirements. Smaller banks with less risky portfolios don’t have to buy complex models or build expensive internal programs if they aren’t necessary. Sometimes, simple spread sheets that capture sensitivity analyses to several scenarios are, as Goldilocks would say, “just right.” So if the bank is small or if it’s not that complex, if we’re comfortable that its risk level is low or its risk management is strong, we’re going to have a much lighter touch.\n\nI know that we can do more to tailor supervisory expectations for community banks, and my message to you today is that this is a high priority at the Federal Reserve. It’s also an area where continued dialogue with you will help us make meaningful progress.\n\nFintech\n\nThe second topic on my mind is financial technology, or fintech, by which I mean new ways of providing financial services through technology. A broad discussion of fintech would encompass lending platforms, payment processes, investment and savings, blockchain and digital currencies, and myriad other topics. My thoughts this morning are focused on fintech platforms that have the potential to transform financial services for consumers and small businesses.\n\nThere are points in history when invention fundamentally changes how industries function. We may be seeing one right now. Paul Volcker wasn’t flattering the financial services industry when he said in 2009 that the last great innovation in banking was the ATM, but he probably had a point. It’s been a while since we’ve seen a true game-changer, but fintech may be one.\n\nAs you all know, investment in fintech firms has grown quickly, as have the number of companies that have the potential to disrupt many aspects of traditional banking. The drivers of these developments are strong: the power and ubiquity of mobile devices, the ability to access and analyze big data in areas such as credit underwriting, and changes in consumers’ expectations and demands. In my view, these are structural and permanent changes.\n\nMore and more banks are collaborating with fintech companies, whether through acquisitions, investments, funding, or lending partnerships that range from loan originations to loan purchases to referral arrangements. In fact, WIB is offering different variants of these innovative partnership models. We don’t yet know which of the various partnership models will ultimately survive, and it’s probably foolish at this early stage to make any bets – a lot of people thought Betamax was going to win the videocassette wars. But no matter the eventual survivors in this space, fintech is likely to change banking. And everyone, from both the banking and regulatory perspectives, needs to be thinking about the implications of these changes.\n\nThere is great possibility. Fintech innovations have the potential to benefit both consumers and small businesses by expanding access to financial services of all types, reaching underserved customers, reducing transaction costs, providing greater transparency with simpler products and clear cost disclosures, providing greater convenience and efficiency, and enabling tighter controls over spending and budgeting. For smaller banks, they provide opportunities to return to areas like unsecured consumer lending and better reach underserved populations. They also could reduce transaction costs and allow banks to better meet changing consumer needs.\n\nBut there are also risks to banks. Fintech could be a disruptive force, creating competitive pressures in terms of speed, convenience, and price, and siphoning off customers, particularly in small business lending. Also, fintech lending models raise an array of risk and policy questions. How will the models perform over a full credit cycle? How are BSA, information security, and customer privacy and data security managed, and by whom? And importantly, how is consumer protection ensured? It’s conceivable that innovative algorithms, unintentionally or not, could enable new forms of redlining or other unfair credit practices. Bankers and supervisors alike need to learn more about fintech and develop appropriate strategies to capitalize on its benefits and mitigate its risks.\n\nFor example, bankers need to consider which model of engagement makes the most strategic sense in light of their business model and risk management infrastructure. They need to be prepared to manage this outsourced relationship consistent with supervisory expectations. Timing must also be considered: early adoption carries the risk of committing to products and partners that may not survive, while waiting too long could mean losing customers and new business opportunities.\n\nSupervisors need to find an appropriate balance of oversight. This is always challenging, but much more so in such a dynamic and fast-moving field that offers both great promise and high risk. For example, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency recently issued a white paper that aims to kick off discussions about how to regulate this fast growing sector.1 As we develop relevant and appropriate supervisory policy, we have to consider which existing regulations or guidance may be ill-suited to capture this new set of risks. We also need to be aware that some regulation could snuff out innovation in ways that we as a society might regret.\n\nFor all of these reasons, the Federal Reserve is focused on fintech. We’re reviewing existing regulations and coordinating with other regulatory agencies. We have convened several high-level working groups that bring together the best thinking across the Fed, including economists, payments specialists, supervisors, and community development experts. We are also learning from supervisory agencies in other countries about how they are considering the issues and opportunities fintech presents. This topic is of particular importance to my Reserve Bank in San Francisco, given the number of fintech companies and partnering banks located in our District. I have created a small fintech team that regularly meets with innovators and with state member banks and holding companies that partner or are considering partnerships with them. This team then shares their knowledge and expertise with our examiners and supervisory staff. Additionally, we are actively involved in the national policy discussions on fintech.\n\nIn short, the Federal Reserve understands the significance of fintech and is committed to getting this right – balancing the promise of innovation with the risks.\n\nRisk Culture\n\nFinally, I want to share some thoughts about risk culture. We’ve been discussing this issue in the Fed quite a bit in light of the significant compliance breakdowns at some of the largest, most complex financial institutions. But the importance of culture is not just a big bank issue. In fact, it’s not even specifically a financial services issue; every organization and group has a unique culture that influences how their people behave. In financial services, however, it’s particularly important because culture is a significant factor in executing a strong risk management framework.\n\nYou all know the tenets of a strong risk framework: articulating risk appetites, putting formal policies into place, establishing strong internal controls, and ensuring oversight by both senior management and boards of directors, to name a few. These form the foundation of risk management, but I think of risk culture as something different. I see risk culture in the encouraged—or, in some cases, tolerated—values of a firm, many of which are unstated. They’re the values that drive staffs’ behaviors, and they’re found in employees’ answers to questions like: What do we do when no one’s looking? How do we get ahead in this organization? Do management’s actions support their stated policies on risk?\n\nStaff answer those questions by observing. They look at how their firms are managed deep within business lines. They watch what behaviors are ultimately rewarded. They see whether leaders “walk the talk.” And they see the results of others’ alignment or misalignment with stated policy. These observations are one driver of individual behaviors.\n\nHowever, behavior is complex, and it is driven by many motivations, some of which are hard to identify. People generally are influenced by their environment, and their day-to-day experiences form the crux of their belief in an organization’s culture. People also are moved by incentives, monetary or otherwise. They’re affected by group dynamics and decision-making norms and style. These aren’t traditional concepts of risk management, nor are they generally within the skillset or purview of most supervisors or bank executives to assess – yet they are important components to a strong risk culture, and inextricably linked to its success.\n\nI have become quite interested in thinking about culture and behaviors as drivers of the effectiveness of a firm’s overall risk management framework. Increasingly, when I meet with boards of directors, I am framing our supervisory findings, especially repeat findings, in the context of some of these cultural questions and am asking the directors to do the same. Supervisors in other jurisdictions are going even further and assessing culture as part of their supervisory oversight.2\n\nA healthy culture starts at the top. It’s the job of the board, in conjunction with management, to articulate what culture they want for their institution and to take an active role in assessing whether they are achieving it—looking critically at all the explicit and implicit incentives that either support or work against this stated culture. But the tone at the top may not be enough. A recent Group of Thirty paper, Banking Conduct and Culture: A Call for Sustained and Comprehensive Reform, introduced a phrase that resonated with me: Echo from the bottom.3 “Echo from the bottom” means that all levels of the organization not only talk the talk, but walk the talk in their everyday actions. How are ethical breaches dealt with? How quickly and thoroughly were compliance lapses settled? Did management investigate whether it was a singular occurrence or part of a larger problem?\n\nBoards should do more than just set the tone. They should lead by example and monitor the organization’s progress. In smaller community banks, walking the floors and hearing directly from employees, perhaps through meeting with staff at various levels in the company, may be the most effective way to assess culture. In larger banks, informal surveys can help, as can looking at turnover, complaints, and audits. But in all banks, the commitment to a general culture that is aligned with the specific risk management framework needs to be embedded at every level.\n\nI know I’m not alone in thinking about this topic. It’s tough to pick up a banking newspaper or magazine without seeing some mention of the importance of risk culture. And the New York Fed has created an excellent web site that includes a wealth of information about governance and culture reform.4 I believe that risk culture is a topic worth discussing more, given our shared goal of banks executing strong risk management programs.\n\nConclusion\n\nSo that’s what’s been on my mind lately. Some of the issues for the banking industry are straightforward, like our commitment to tailoring requirements for smaller banks. Others, such as fintech, are dynamic and have the potential to change aspects of banking as we know it. And others are in the nebulous realm of concepts like culture and require perhaps unorthodox approaches to secure tangible results. I believe that these topics are ripe for robust dialogue between bankers and supervisors, given our mutual interest in maintaining an environment in which community banks can thrive. I’m grateful to have an opportunity to talk with you today and to reiterate how much we value our relationship with banking organizations like the WIB. Thank you.\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1.

            "content": "\n\nThank you. It’s a pleasure to participate in this event and to enjoy the beauty and hospitality of the wonderful state of Hawaii. Sadly, this is my first visit here in 25 years. In fact, the last time I was here was back when I worked for a small business in the San Francisco Bay Area after I graduated from college. The business owner sent me on an all-expenses-paid, week-long vacation as a reward for hard work. Throughout my career at the Federal Reserve, I’ve tried to convince my bosses of the productivity-enhancing benefits of such an enlightened management practice. Unfortunately, I never succeeded. Now, as President of the San Francisco Fed, it is my pleasant duty to visit all nine states in the 12th Federal Reserve District. I plan to be diligent in fulfilling that duty. So, I assure you, it won’t be another 25 years till I’m back.\n\nIn my remarks this evening, I’m going to talk about the current state of the economy, where it’s headed, and what the Federal Reserve is doing to boost growth while keeping inflation low. My remarks represent my own views and not those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIt’s been over two-and-a-half years since the end of the worst recession of the post-World War II period. The economy is growing, and the recent economic news has been increasingly positive. This is very welcome progress, but it’s brought us only part of the way back. Unemployment remains a huge problem, and that means real hardship for millions of Americans.\n\nThe severe recession and subdued recovery have prompted the Fed to carry out a series of extraordinary policy actions to restore the economy to health. Most notably, we’ve kept our benchmark short-term interest rate near zero for over three years. This aggressive Fed response is an important reason why the economy has moved to more solid ground. But, as I’ll explain, the Fed’s job is not over yet. Far from it. Congress has assigned the Fed two goals: maximum employment and stable prices. We have lots of work to do before we can say we’ve met those goals. Looking at past deep recessions, you would have expected the economy to be doing much better than it is by now. Why has this recovery been so lackluster? The reason has everything to do with what took place beforehand. We’ve had a wild ride—first a housing boom of epic proportions, then a housing bust, a near-collapse of the financial system, and a terrible recession.\n\nLet’s go back to 2006, right before the recession hit. That marked the peak of an unprecedented run-up in U.S. home prices. But the bubble burst. Home prices plunged by over 30 percent nationwide, and even more in states such as Nevada, Arizona, and Florida. As the housing market went into a tailspin, about a quarter of borrowers found themselves owing more than their homes were worth. Delinquencies and foreclosures surged.\n\nWith millions of mortgages going sour, financial institutions that had placed big bets on home loans posted massive losses. It was like an epidemic. No one knew which financial institutions were infected with toxic assets. Everyone was suspect. Financial institutions were afraid to lend money to anybody, including each other. That choked off the flow of funds that financial institutions and businesses depend on for their day-to-day operations. The result was a worldwide financial crisis.\n\nIf left unchecked, this kind of financial panic could have ushered in an economic cataclysm like the Great Depression, when 25 percent of the workforce was out of work. Why didn’t we plunge into the abyss? A key reason was that the Federal Reserve did what it was supposed to do. The Fed is the nation’s government-chartered central bank. And one of the most important duties of a central bank is to safeguard the financial system. In a crisis, that means acting as lender of last resort, supplying emergency loans to financial institutions when normal funding isn’t available. The U.S. Treasury Department and other federal agencies were also doing all they could to shore up the financial system.\n\nNow, I know that this financial support to big banks and Wall Street firms made many people irate, especially when so many Americans were losing their jobs or their homes. We should remember, though, that ordinary people suffer terribly when the financial system breaks down. The ultimate goal of our programs was to avert a major depression and much higher unemployment.\n\nBecause of these programs, we were able to avoid a meltdown of the financial system and head off a depression. But we couldn’t prevent a terrible recession. The shock waves from the burst housing bubble and the financial crisis were simply too great.\n\nSo it’s not so surprising that we got an anemic rebound. The financial crisis unleashed powerful forces that have damped spending and sapped the recovery of its vigor. I’ll mention three. First, it destroyed a huge amount of household wealth. Second, it flattened the housing market. Third, it made it hard for businesses and households to get credit. Let’s look at each of these.\n\nFirst, when house prices collapsed, the wealth of American households plunged by about six-and-a-half trillion dollars. That equals more than 40 percent of the total size of the U.S. economy. Many people went from feeling rich to feeling poor, with neither the means nor the will to spend. Instead, they became intent on repairing their finances by increasing their saving and trimming their debt. In other words, they deleveraged. During the recession, the household saving rate climbed to about 6 percent of income from about 1 percent. It’s still about 4-1/2 percent. In the long run, higher saving is healthy. But, in the near term, it puts a brake on spending and slows growth.\n\nTight credit is a third powerful force holding back the recovery. Lenders who were too quick with a loan in 2006 have turned very cautious. Consumers who lack gold-plated credit scores and cash for a hefty down payment find it tough to get a mortgage. That limits home sales and refinancing. Fortunately, there are signs that credit conditions are easing a bit. Already, corporations that can sell securities have great access to capital.\n\nThese three forces—household finances, housing, and credit—are likely to hold down spending growth for some time. But let me emphasize, though—overall, things are getting better. You can sense greater optimism out there—albeit cautious optimism.\n\nLet’s look then at the positive side of the ledger. Little by little, households are repairing their finances. Businesses are gradually increasing production and hiring. The housing sector appears to have stabilized and is showing some signs of life. Consumer spending, which represents close to 70 percent of all economic activity, hasn’t been growing fast, but it’s been growing steadily. More motor vehicles were sold in January than in any month in nearly four years. The growth in consumer spending is also evident here in Hawaii. Last year was the best for tourist visits since 2007.\n\nExports have consistently been a bright spot for the economy over the past few years. Overseas demand for American products continues to grow. This increase has been rapid to our North American trading partners, and also to emerging economies of East Asia, including China. Indeed, exports are one reason U.S. manufacturers have been creating jobs at a pace not seen since the 1990s.\n\nGross domestic product, or GDP, measures the nation’s total output of goods and services. After adjusting for inflation, GDP grew at less than a 1 percent annual rate in the first half of 2011, dragged down by temporary factors, including the surge in oil prices, and the Japanese tsunami. Growth picked up to about 2¼ percent in the second half of 2011 as those temporary factors receded. My forecast calls for GDP to rise about 2¼ percent this year and 2¾ percent in 2013. That’s not rip-roaring by any means. But it’s an improvement.\n\nI’m especially encouraged by the good news from the job market. In the past four months, the unemployment rate has fallen about three-quarters of a percentage point. It’s now at its lowest level in nearly three years. All the same, the kind of moderate economic growth I forecast won’t keep bringing the unemployment rate down quickly. That rate is currently 8.3 percent. I expect it to remain over 8 percent into next year and still be well over 7 percent for several years to come. If my forecast is correct, the unemployment rate will have stayed at or above 8 percent for more than four years. Such a long period of unemployment above 8 percent has not happened in over 70 years.\n\nFor its part, inflation has been relatively contained. The prices of oil and other commodities did surge early last year in the face of strong global demand. This caused the overall inflation rate to rise above our 2 percent target. Oil prices have run up again recently, and have returned to their peak levels from last spring. As far as other commodity prices are concerned, we haven’t seen a similar surge. With the economy still underperforming and wage growth modest, inflation should remain subdued. I expect inflation to be about 1¾ percent this year and to be about 1½ percent next year, down from about 2¾ percent in 2011.\n\nThere’s a risk the economy could do worse than this moderate forecast. The main threat is the debt crisis in Europe. The latest news from that continent is somewhat reassuring, although more severe turmoil is still possible. Once again, European leaders have found a short-term fix to Greece’s problems. Hopefully, that will prevent the situation from spinning out of control and igniting a wider financial crisis in Europe.\n\nIn addition to the actions of European political leaders, central banks have been actively supplying liquidity to the European banking system. The Fed set up temporary currency swap lines with several foreign central banks last November. These lines allow those central banks to borrow dollars and, in turn, lend those dollars to banks in their countries. In addition, the European Central Bank has provided hundreds of billions of euros in three-year loans to European banks. These actions have defused concerns about the ability of European banks to renew credit when their debts come due. In this way, Europe has avoided what could have been a massive credit crunch as banks pulled back lending sharply. I don’t need to remind you that, in today’s interconnected world, financial turmoil in Europe would definitely hurt our economy as well.\n\nEven if the European crisis doesn’t flare up again, growth is slowing in many parts of the world. Many European countries already appear to be in recession, and there is a danger that this situation could worsen significantly as governments put in place austerity measures. Turning to Asia, growth in China has also slowed as that country has tightened monetary and credit policies to reduce inflation. Indeed, the list of countries that are still experiencing solid growth is getting shorter all the time. If China’s economy has a hard landing, there really aren’t many sources of strength left in the global economy.\n\nThe Fed’s monetary policy body is called the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC. As you know, the Fed influences the economy through its ability to affect interest rates. In December 2008, when the recession was hitting with full force, the FOMC lowered the federal funds rate, the rate banks pay to borrow from each other on overnight loans, close to zero. It’s been there ever since. Given the weakness in the economy, standard monetary policy guidelines indicate that the federal funds rate should have gone deep into negative territory. But, of course, it’s not possible for interest rates to go much below zero.\n\nSo the Fed has had to look for alternative ways to stimulate the economy. For example, we’ve purchased over one-and-three-quarters trillion dollars of longer-term securities issued by the U.S. government and mortgage agencies. This raises the prices on these securities, which lowers their yields. And lower yields on longer-term Treasury securities tend to push down other longer-term interest rates. That reduces the cost of borrowing across the board, from mortgages, to business loans, to corporate debt. Our securities purchases are an important reason why longer-term interest rates are at or near post-World War II lows.\n\nIn addition, we’ve publicly announced that we expect to keep the federal funds rate exceptionally low at least through late 2014. This guidance tells investors that short-term interest rates are likely to stay low for a long time, which then gets passed through to longer-term rates. Of course, our statements are not an absolute commitment to keep rates near zero. It’s simply the FOMC’s current judgment about the best future course of policy. If the economic outlook changes, then the guidance could change too.\n\nSecond, we now regularly report our views about the probable course of short-term interest rates over the next few years. Under current economic circumstances, most Fed policymakers judge that near-zero short-term interest rates will be appropriate well into 2014. In this way, our interest rate forecasts reinforce our public guidance. Releasing the views of policymakers in this fashion should further reduce public uncertainty about our plans. And that, in turn, improves the effectiveness of our policies.\n\nWe at the Fed are broadening our commitment to openness and accountability. And we’re doing all we can to carry out the mission Congress gave us. The Fed’s powers are limited. Lower interest rates alone can’t fix all the economy’s problems. But monetary accommodation is indispensible. The economy would be in much worse shape if the Fed weren’t acting so energetically.\n\nLooking ahead, we may need to do more if the recovery falters or if inflation stays well below 2 percent. If the economy does need more stimulus, restarting our program of purchasing mortgage-backed securities would probably be the best course of action. The policy actions the Fed takes will depend on how economic conditions develop. If circumstances change, our policies will adapt. No matter the circumstances, I assure you that we at the Fed are doing everything we can to achieve the goals of maximum employment and stable prices. Thank you very much.\n\n"

            "content": "Good morning, and thanks very much for inviting me today. I’m delighted to be here with you. As 2005 draws to a close, it’s a good time to take a look back at the year that has passed and to think about what may lie ahead for the U.S. economy in 2006. In taking this retrospective and prospective approach, I’m going to organize my remarks around three broad topics. The first is employment and output growth. The second is inflation. Not surprisingly, energy prices factor significantly into developments in both realms and are relevant in shaping the risks going forward. My third and last topic is the conduct of monetary policy, and here I plan to touch on one of the legacies of Chairman Greenspan. As you no doubt know, at the end of January, he is stepping down after 18 years of distinguished service to the Federal Reserve and to the country, and Ben Bernanke will then, in all likelihood, have been confirmed by the Senate and will therefore be in a position to assume the Chairmanship. The Greenspan legacy I want to focus on is this: the public’s increased confidence in the Fed’s commitment to price stability, and the Fed’s increased transparency about monetary policy. In particular, I will give you some of my thoughts about how greater central bank credibility and transparency enhance the conduct of monetary policy and the stability of the U.S. economy.\n\nLooking back at 2005, clearly one of the most dramatic events was the one-two punch of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. It goes without saying that the economic consequences for the Gulf Coast region have been enormous. More than a million people have been displaced, thousands of businesses and jobs have been disrupted or destroyed, and the infrastructure—notably for energy—took a severe beating.\n\nWhen the hurricanes hit at the end of August, the economy had been doing quite well. Over the preceding two years, monetary accommodation and robust productivity growth supported economic activity. Real GDP grew steadily at, or above, its potential or long-run sustainable pace, which is estimated at three to three and a quarter percent. This pattern continued even during the third quarter, when real GDP is estimated to have grown by four and a quarter percent. With this stretch of near or above-trend growth in economic activity, slack in resource use has gradually, but steadily, diminished—that is, jobs have increased by more than enough to absorb a growing workforce, and the unemployment rate has declined. Indeed, for October and November, unemployment came in at 5 percent, a number that’s near conventional estimates consistent with so-called “full employment.” At the same time, capacity utilization in American industry has risen—although, at 79 percent, it is still somewhat lower than its long-run average. Moreover, signs point to another robust performance in the fourth quarter, so growth for the last half of 2005 could well come in noticeably above the potential rate.\n\nThis positive performance suggests that the overall economy has been quite resilient in absorbing the impact of the storms. For 2006, it seems likely that this strength will continue in the first half, as rebuilding kicks in. Then, in the second half, a couple of factors are likely to cause economic growth to settle into a trend-like pattern. One of the factors is the winding down of the rebuilding effort. The other is the lagged effect of monetary policy tightening; in other words, tighter financial conditions will have some dampening impact on interest-sensitive sectors, such as consumer durables and housing.\n\nAn important factor shaping the outlook, of course, is energy prices. Over the year and a half before the storms, energy prices had surged worldwide, with the price of oil nearly doubling and the price of natural gas rising by about two-thirds. Energy prices spiked following the storm, but they retreated fairly quickly. At this point, oil and wholesale and retail gasoline prices are actually below those prevailing before the storms, though they are still a good deal higher than they were a year and a half ago. Finally, natural gas prices have fallen substantially, but now are above pre-hurricane levels.\n\nOf course, we normally would expect the year-and-a-half-old energy price surge to push down spending. This is because the additional amount that households are forced to spend for the same quantities of gasoline, natural gas, heating oil, and other energy-intensive products tends to diminish their ability to spend on other goods and services. Likewise, firms feel the bite in narrower profit margins, which may crimp the amount they decide to spend on investment in plant and equipment.\n\nRecent data suggest, however, that consumer spending has held up well so far. For example, although personal consumption expenditures were up only modestly in October, they were held down by a big drop in auto sales that probably reflected reduced sales incentives; outside of autos, personal consumption expenditures were robust, despite the surge in energy prices and plummeting confidence. Indicators of business spending and output also have held up well. It is possible that higher energy prices have had a negative impact on consumer spending, but the drag from this factor has been offset by other stimuli to spending such as rising home prices and growth in disposable income. But for now, at least, it appears that the national economy has come through the twin shocks of the hurricanes and the year and a half long escalation in energy prices quite well. Concerns about downside risks to the economy seem much smaller than just a few months ago.\n\nThis is definitely good news, but uncertainties do remain—especially during a period like this, when the stance of monetary policy is changing. It’s inherently difficult to judge the exact magnitude and timing of the effects of removing policy accommodation. Therefore, it will be very important to monitor this situation in the months ahead, particularly if, as seems likely, there is cooling in the housing market and other interest-sensitive sectors.\n\nMy focus so far has been on developments that relate to the Fed’s objective of keeping the economy operating in the vicinity of full employment. However, like central banks worldwide, the Federal Reserve is also keenly focused on maintaining price stability. One particularly comprehensive measure of consumer prices that the Fed monitors closely is the index for personal consumption expenditures—the so-called PCE price index. Inflation in this measure has jumped to 3.3 percent over the last twelve months, reflecting large increases in energy prices. However, energy prices, like food prices, tend to be quite volatile. So a better measure of underlying inflation—one that tells us more about where inflation is likely to be in the longer run—is so-called core inflation, which excludes the energy and food components. Inflation by this measure is up by a much more moderate 1.8 percent over the twelve months ending in October.\n\nI have previously enunciated that, in my view, core PCE inflation in a range of 1 to 2 percent constitutes an appropriate price stability objective for the Fed. Since 1.8 percent is in the upper portion of this comfort range, I’d be happier if this measure were somewhat lower. And, indeed, it is lower if we look over a shorter horizon. For the sixmonths ending in October, core PCE inflation came in at 1.6 percent at an annual rate—which is near the middle of my preferred range. This suggests to me that core inflation has been essentially compatible with the Fed’s price stability objective, even in the face of a rather large oil shock that started well before Katrina.\n\nLooking ahead, I’m generally fairly optimistic about the future for inflation, though I do think there are upside risks—mainly having to do with energy prices—that require vigilance by the FOMC in the period ahead. Let me start with the optimistic factors. First, productivity growth has remained quite strong, and growth in labor costs has remained modest so far. Second, although there is probably little if any slack in labor markets at this point in the cycle, the economy does not appear to have overshot full employment. Furthermore, there still appears to be a bit of unused capacity left in the industrial sector.\n\nWith regard to energy, it’s certainly a good sign that—so far—higher energy prices have not been passed through to higher non-energy or core prices to a significant extent. I want to emphasize the “so far” part of that statement, because a ny sign of a more significant pass-though would be a concern for monetary policy. One need only think of the 1970s to know what I’m referring to. At that time, higher oil prices were associated with a wage-price spiral that pushed inflation into double-digit territory. Naturally, much research has gone into analyzing what happened during that period, and I’m glad to report that the research suggests major differences between then and now. One of the key findings concerns the role that inflation expectations play in generating the wage-price spiral. To sum up a great deal of literature very briefly, the idea is that under some circumstances inflation expectations can be like self-fulfilling prophecies. If people expect higher inflation, they will behave in the marketplace in ways that will actually generate higher inflation; for example, they will rush to make purchases thinking that tomorrow’s price will be higher than today’s. And they will tend to build higher expected inflation into wage bargaining; this raises costs to businesses, which, in turn, may get built into the prices of their products. Unwinding the inflationary spiral is, to put it mildly, not fun. In the early 1980s, the Fed had to do it by slamming hard on the brakes, and the costs were high—the economy went through a large double-dip recession, and the unemployment rate hit 10 percent in 1982.\n\nWhat’s different now? Since the early 1980s, the Fed has continued to work to lower the inflation rate with considerable success, so that over the last ten years core PCE inflation has averaged a moderate 1.7 percent. With this history of low inflation, it’s natural that the public would expect inflation to remain in a low range. As economists express it, inflation expectations have become “well anchored” to price stability—most likely because people are confident that the Fed will act to limit any potential rise in inflation. This may account for research results suggesting that, during this period, energy price increases have generally not been passed through to core inflation.1\n\nWe actually have some evidence on people’s current inflation expectations. One source of information comes from responses to surveys about inflation expectations. A University of Michigan survey taken shortly after the hurricanes hit recorded a large jump in inflation expectations—for the overall CPI—over the next twelve months, and a smaller increase in expectations for the next ten years. But I would not read too much into this, since the near-term survey results reflect the impact of energy price developments; of course, the higher near-term result also affects the average increase expected over the next ten years.\n\nAnother source of information on inflation expectations comes from analyses using a financial instrument that is called Treasury Inflation-Protected Security, or TIPS for short. The key feature of TIPS is that the payments to investors adjust automatically to compensate for the actual change in the CPI. By comparing yields on these securities with those on standard Treasury securities that are not indexed to compensate for inflation developments, we can estimate what the market thinks inflation will do over the life of the securities.\n\nIn other words, using this kind of analysis, we can estimate inflation expectations over various time horizons.2 Compensation for average inflation over the next five years rose by about ¼ percentage point in the month following Katrina, but has since dipped below pre-hurricane levels. Furthermore, it is notable that longer-term inflation expectations—those covering the period from five years ahead to ten years ahead—are slightly below the level that prevailed when oil prices started to rise in early 2004. This development supports the view that the public has confidence in the FOMC’s commitment to price stability, even in the face of a large energy price shock.\n\nThis brings me to my last point, the conduct of policy. Clearly, for monetary policymakers, the public’s confidence in our commitment to price stability is a very helpful thing. As I’ve just indicated, well-anchored inflation expectations themselves are likely helping to contain the inflationary pressures associated with higher energy prices. Therefore, policy’s response to those pressures can be more tempered than “slamming on the brakes,” and that means running less of a risk of pushing the economy into a deep recession. Public confidence is helpful in other circumstances, too. If there’s a sudden drop in demand, the Committee can ease to offset it without worrying that the public will think policy is on a path toward overstimulation that would generate inflation. Stable inflation expectations allow monetary policy to respond to shocks without having to pitch the economy too far in one direction or the other; in other words, credibility facilitates the pursuit of our dual mandate for price stability and “full” employment—the two main policy goals articulated in the Federal Reserve Act.\n\nHow has the Committee established credibility? First, of course, as I said, inflation has come down markedly over the past twenty-five years and stayed low for quite some time. I don’t want to give all the credit for this to monetary policy, because, of course, rapid productivity growth has played an important role as well. But the Committee hasbeen diligent about the actions it has taken—setting policy to lower inflation gradually and to keep it low.\n\nIn keeping with this strategy, at the November meeting, the Committee voted to continue its gradual removal of policy accommodation and raised the federal funds rate target to four percent. The objective of this policy action—as well as any future actions—is to position the economy on a trajectory characterized by “full employment” and price stability. Such a so-called glide path requires that as slack in labor markets is absorbed, real output growth must converge toward a sustainable long-run pace at the same time that inflation is at its desired rate.\n\nIn addition to actions such as this, I believe the Committee has reinforced its credibility with the public by becoming more transparent and focusing on communication. By this I mean that the Committee has made a significant effort to let the public know what it has done and why in recent years. Let me recount quickly the steps toward greater transparency which began in 1994. First, the Committee started issuing post-meeting press releases that explicitly announced changes in the federal funds rate target; then it added descriptions of the state of the economy and the rationale for the policy action to the release; then it introduced a statement describing the “balance of risks” to the outlook; then it began releasing the votes of individual Committee members and the preferred policy choices of any dissenters; then it added explicit language concerningfuture policy to its post meeting press release; and finally, it decided to release the minutes of its meetings with a much shorter delay—only three weeks instead of five to eight weeks—so that now the minutes appear before the next meeting, instead of after it.\n\nTransparency is helpful not only in building credibility, but it is also helpful in another important way. By letting everyone in on its current thinking, the Committee helps to align expectations, including those in financial markets, with its best estimate of where policy is likely to go. A good example of this was in 2003, when it appeared that there was a threat of outright deflation. This was a potentially serious situation and the Committee wanted to lean on the side of an accommodative policy until the threat had passed. The statement said that “In these circumstances, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.” I think this forward-looking language was helpful in keeping long-term interest rates lower than they otherwise would have been, which helped to reduce the risk of deflation.\n\nAnother example is what happened following the recent hurricanes. Before the September FOMC meeting, there was a great deal of speculation about the Committee’s response to the potential for a simultaneous slowdown in growth and rise in inflation. The September release stated that “While these unfortunate developments have increased uncertainty about near-term economic performance, it is the Committee’s view that they do not pose a more persistent threat.” It went on to say that, “the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.” I believe that these clarifications and signals about future actions helped avoid confusion about the Committee’s perspective and contributed importantly to making policy more effective.\n\nAs I said, the sentences about where policy is likely to go reflect the Committee’s best estimates. And best estimates, of course, are always subject to revision. So I want to emphasize that, in my view, the Committee must always have the flexibility to respond to changing circumstances. Indeed, the statement typically includes language along those lines. For example, in November, the statement said “the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.”\n\nIf you look at the minutes from the November meeting, you will see that the statement is currently a subject of discussion. Two phrases in particular are at issue: “remove accommodation” and “at a measured pace.” While it seems unlikely that the end of the current tightening phase is yet at hand, there obviously will come a time when these two phrases are no longer appropriate, and other changes to the statement may be needed as well. As the November minutes suggest, going forward, the Committee will pay close attention to incoming data and weigh options carefully in assessing the stance of policy and the wording of the statement.\n\nI started this discussion of the conduct of policy by saying that public confidence in the Committee’s commitment to price stability is a helpful thing. As I’ve indicated, I believe that this public confidence has strengthened under Chairman Greenspan’s leadership of the Fed, with years of consistently low inflation and a communication strategy that has made the conduct of U.S. monetary policy more transparent to the public.I’d like to close by saying that public confidence is also a very valuable thing—and like all valuable things, it is hard to win and easy to lose. For my part, this must mean ensuring—in both deeds and words—that, as developments unfold, our economy does not suffer from an unacceptable rise in inflation.\n\n1.

            "content": "Tonight I would like to focus on how the Fed, or central banks, more generally, should respond to asset price bubbles. This is one of the few policy issues where the Fed’s approach has come in for real criticism. I thought it might be of interest to this audience since, one way or another, it has probably touched the life of almost everyone here in the Bay Area. I saw that in memorable ways when I returned to MBA teaching at Haas in the fall of 1999 after a stint in Washington including 2½ years as a Governor of the Fed. During one class, I heard some background buzz. A student in my global macroeconomics class was chattering away on his cell phone. I looked his way and frowned. He apologized, explaining that he was finalizing the details for his internet startup to go public. Those were heady days in the markets, in the Bay Area, and at Haas. The Fed suspected there was a stock price bubble developing as early as 1996. I was still at the Board when Greenspan made his famous irrational exuberance speech. The Fed chose not to try to burst the bubble. Instead, it did its very best to pick up the pieces when the bubble finally popped. I think that effort was pretty successful. But many observers wonder if we erred and think the Fed should have tightened monetary policy sooner.\n\nThe question is not one of purely historic interest. Today, it’s not stock prices but house prices that have been soaring. Those of us who live in the Bay Area know that you can’t get through a cocktail party without some discussion of an eye-popping price somebody just got for their two-bedroom, one-bath handyman special.\n\nBut the Bay Area isn’t the only place in the country, or the world, for that matter, where soaring house prices have raised concerns about national economic stability. In the U.S. as a whole, the share of residential investment in GDP is now at its highest level in decades, and this sector has been a key source of strength in the current expansion. The question for policy is: will this source of strength reverse course and become instead a source of weakness? Put more bluntly: Is there a house-price “bubble” that might deflate, and if so, what would that mean for the nation’s economy? What, if anything, should policy do beforehand? Fortunately, there is a large scholarly literature on asset price bubbles and monetary policy, and Haas faculty in finance, economics and real estate have made important contributions.\n\nThe literature generally defines a bubble as a situation where the price of an asset—in this case, housing—is significantly higher than its fundamental value. One common way of judging whether housing’s price is in line with its fundamental value is to consider the ratio of housing prices to rents. This is analogous to the ratio of prices to dividends for stocks. In the case of housing, rents reflect the flow of benefits obtained from housing assets—either the monetary return from rental property, or the value of living in owner-occupied housing. Historically, the ratio for the U.S. has had many ups and downs, but over time it has tended to return to its long-run average. In other words, when the price-to-rent ratio is high, housing prices tend to grow more slowly or fall for a time, and when the ratio is low, prices tend to rise more rapidly. I want to emphasize, though, that this is a loose relationship that can be counted on only for rough guidance rather than a precise reading.\n\nCurrently, the ratio for the U.S. is higher than at any time since data became available in 1970—about 38 percent above its long-run average. Of course, the ratios vary widely from place to place in the U.S. and in different countries. For Los Angeles and San Francisco, the price-to-rent ratio is about 75 percent higher than the normal level, while for Cleveland the ratio is very near its historical average. For the U.K., the ratio is more than double its long-run average, whereas in Japan it’s only about three-quarters of its normal level.1\n\nHigher than normal ratios do not necessarily prove that there’s a house-price bubble. House prices could be high for some good, fundamental reasons. For example, there have been changes in the tax laws that reduce the potential tax bite from selling one home and buying another. Another development, which may be making housing more like an investment vehicle in the U.S., is that it’s now easier and cheaper to get at the equity—either through refinancing, which has become a less costly process, or through an equity line of credit. These innovations in mortgage markets make the funds invested in houses more liquid. There are also constraints on the supply of housing in a number of markets, including the Bay Area. Probably the most obvious candidate for a fundamental factor is low mortgage interest rates. Even so, the consensus seems to be that the high price-to-rent ratio for housing cannot be fully accounted for by these factors. So, while I’m certainly not predicting anything about future house price movements, I think it’s obvious that the housing sector represents a serious issue for monetary policymakers to consider.\n\nHow, then, should monetary policy react to unusually high prices of houses—or of other assets, for that matter? As a starting point, let me note that the issue is not now (nor during the stock market boom) whether policy should react at all. As part of its analysis of demand in the economy, central bank models have long incorporated the wealth effect of house prices and other assets on spending; it is just one of many factors, including fiscal policy, exchange rates, and so on, that affect demand. The debate lies in determining when, if ever, policy should be focused on deflating the asset price bubble itself.2\n\nIn my view, it makes sense to organize one’s thinking around three consecutive questions—three hurdles to jump before pulling the monetary policy trigger. First, if the bubble were to deflate on its own, would the effect on the economy be exceedingly large? Second, is it unlikely that the Fed could mitigate the consequences? Third, is monetary policy the best tool to use to deflate a house-price bubble?\n\nMy answers to these questions in the shortest possible form are, “no,” “no,” and “no.” In the most thorough possible form, my answers might take a few hours, and would give full play to the many gray areas that are involved. Since the short answer is not satisfactory and the thorough one overwhelms our time limits, I will compromise and give just a brief explanation for my trio of “nos.”\n\nIn answer to the first question on the size of the effect, it could be large enough to feel like a good-sized bump in the road, but the economy would likely to be able to absorb the shock. For example, a reversion to the long-run price-rent ratio would appear to represent a shock that is only about half the size of the U.S. stock market collapse in 2000 and 2001.\n\nIn answer to the second question on timing, the spending slowdown that would ensue is likely to kick in gradually, because it mainly affects household wealth. This is important, because Fed policy actions don’t have instantaneous effects, but work through the economy over time. So the impact of a gradual spending slowdown could well be cushioned by an easier policy.\n\nIn answer to the third question on whether monetary policy is the best tool to deflate a house-price bubble, there are several points to consider. For one thing, no one can predict exactly how much tightening would be needed, or by exactly how much the bubble should be reduced. Beyond that, a tighter policy to deflate a housing bubble could impose substantial costs on other sectors of the economy that would lead to equally unwelcome imbalances. Finally, it’s possible that other strategies, such as tighter supervision or changes in financial regulation, would not only be more tailored to the problem, but also less costly to the economy.\n\nTaking all of these points into consideration, it seems that the arguments against trying to deflate a bubble outweigh those in favor of it. So, my bottom line is that monetary policy should react to rising prices for houses or other assets only insofar as they affect the central bank’s goal variables—output, employment, and inflation. But I want to stress that the debate surrounding these issues is still very much alive. As I hinted earlier, there are significant “gray areas” to consider, and these, of course, are often the most interesting, because they involve both subtlety and the complex interplay of economics, politics, and human psychology.\n\nI hope that, in these remarks, I have given you some insight into how at least one policymaker is framing the question of whether to respond to house-price bubbles.\n\n\n\n1.

            "content": "Good afternoon. It’s a pleasure to be here in Salt Lake City with you today. I’m delighted to have the opportunity to outline my thoughts on the U.S. economy and on monetary policy. I hope you’ll have some comments and questions for me afterward. As President of the Federal Reserve Bank serving Utah and eight other Western states, it is my job to bring the economic insights and perspectives of business leaders in our region into deliberations at the policy table. So I am eager to know what issues and developments are particularly on your minds. Let me note, by the way, that my comments in these remarks and in the Q&A reflect my own opinions, not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve.\n\nI’ll start by addressing some major developments in the U.S. economy relating to employment and output growth. I’ll review the recent past and indicate my sense of the economy’s likely path going forward, focusing particularly on risks I see relating to energy and the housing sector. Next I’ll turn to the inflation picture. Finally, I’ll conclude with some thoughts on the course of monetary policy in the U.S.\n\nSix weeks have now passed since Katrina and Rita delivered powerful blows to the U.S. Gulf Coast. Their consequences are by no means behind us and are shaping the near-term outlook in important ways. It goes without saying that the human tragedy has been enormous. According to a recent report, Louisiana alone attributes nearly a thousand deaths just to Katrina. The economic consequences for the region also are enormous. Millions of people were displaced, thousands of businesses and jobs were disrupted or destroyed, and the infrastructure took a severe beating. Hurricane Rita, of course, compounded the economic damage.\n\nStaring into the face of such disasters, it is natural at first to want to use every tool at hand to try to help—which is precisely what the people of Utah did. I understand that Utahns mobilized immediately, sending volunteers to the stricken area and welcoming over five hundred evacuees to the state. The shelter that was put together so quickly at Camp Williams has been called a “mini-city,” with crucial services, like medical support and schooling, as well as those amenities—like hair salons and entertainment—that help give people a glimpse of “ordinary” life in such an extraordinary situation. I understand that now that Camp Williams is closed, apartments or hotels have been found for those who are staying in the area, and many of the children are registered in local schools. This open-handedness, this open-heartedness of the people here has, indeed, been a bright ray of light amid the dark despair that followed those storms.\n\nAs a policymaker, I, too, have been concerned about how best to help. As you know, at the September 20th meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the members voted to continue on the path of gradual tightening that began more than a year ago and increased the target federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 3.75 percent. This was a very conscious decision. It reflected a conviction, which I share, that monetary policy’s greatest contribution in a situation like this is in keeping the national economy on an even keel. Monetary policy, unfortunately, has little scope to cushion the immediate economic fallout because monetary actions can’t be directed only at a particular area of the country and because their effects take time to be felt. Instead, it’s appropriate to use the tools of fiscal policy—especially government spending and transfers—to address the immediate crisis, and this process is, indeed, underway.\n\nWhen Hurricane Katrina hit at the end of August, the economy was doing quite well. Over the preceding two and a half years, real GDP had grown steadily at, or above, its potential or long-run sustainable pace, which, due to continued robust structural productivity, is estimated at three to three and a quarter percent. In the second quarter, the latest for which we have data, real GDP performance was similar—that is, it grew by three and a quarter percent. With this stretch of near or above-trend growth in economic activity, slack in resource use has gradually, but steadily, diminished—that is, jobs have increased by more than enough to absorb a growing workforce. Unemployment has declined, and capacity utilization has risen. Indeed, the latest reading on unemployment before the storm was for August, and it came in at 4.9 percent, a number that’s near conventional estimates consistent with so-called “full employment.”\n\nMy medium-term outlook, before Katrina, was for growth averaging a pace sufficient to keep the economy operating in the vicinity of full employment, albeit with notable risks, particularly relating to energy prices and housing, two factors I will discuss in greater detail in just a moment. Evidence amassed since the storms suggests that the economy has been remarkably resilient and apt to remain on a solid track even though the storms will probably alter the near-term trajectory somewhat. The disruptions they caused will likely put a noticeable dent in overall growth of output and employment in the second half of this year, compared to earlier forecasts; indeed, in September, the unemployment rate rose by a couple of tenths of a percentage point to 5.1 percent, and most of this increase was probably due to the temporary effects of Katrina. For 2006, it seems likely that growth will pick up in the first half, as energy production comes fully back on line and rebuilding kicks in, and then will settle into a trend-like pattern in the second half.\n\nNow to the two risks to output growth and employment that I mentioned—energy prices and housing. As I said, these were present even before Katrina struck. Over the two previous years, energy prices had surged worldwide, with the price of oil more than doubling and even spiking at one point to over $70 per barrel. The macroeconomic effect of higher energy prices is to dampen aggregate demand, as the additional amount that households are forced to spend for the same amount of gasoline, natural gas, heating oil, and so on, diminishes their ability to spend on other goods and services. Likewise, firms feel the bite in narrower profit margins which may crimp the amount they decide to spend on investment in plant and equipment.\n\nThe outlook for trend-like growth in output that I discussed earlier incorporates noticeable effects of the energy shock on household and business spending. However, there are inevitable uncertainties about the intensity of these effects. For example, the intensity depends importantly on whether the higher prices are viewed as transitory—a passing phenomenon—or as a more permanent feature of the economic landscape. If they are seen as largely transitory, then consumers and firms typically try to maintain something close to their usual level of spending while the higher prices last—perhaps by dipping into their reserves. If higher energy prices are expected to persist, however, a deeper and longer-lasting cutback in spending is more likely.\n\nTo gauge perceptions concerning the permanence of higher energy prices, the natural place to look is at futures prices. Even before Katrina, they suggested that higher prices may be here to stay. For example, during the run-up of spot oil prices over the past year and a half, far-dated futures prices rose sharply. Most likely, these futures prices reflected the sense that global demand for oil would remain strong in an environment where there is little excess supply available and where geopolitical uncertainty creates risks to existing supplies.\n\nWith first Katrina and then Rita slamming into the Gulf Coast, the energy situation naturally has become even more of a concern, since that area has such an extensive drilling, refining, and distribution infrastructure. For example, offshore crude oil and natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico accounts for approximately 29 percent and 20 percent, respectively, of total U.S. production levels. Importantly, Gulf Coast refineries account for a whopping 47 percent of total U.S. refining capacity. The latest reports indicate that some of the energy infrastructure of the Gulf has been restored, but progress has been slower than originally expected. Roughly 65 percent of offshore oil and 56 percent of offshore gas production in the Gulf still remains shut in, and about ten percent of U.S. refinery capacity is off line. Energy prices have been quite volatile. At this point, retail gasoline and natural gas prices remain well above pre-Katrina levels, while oil prices and wholesale gasoline prices have actually fallen below those prevailing before the hurricanes.\n\nEarly signs suggest that spending is holding up reasonably well in the wake of higher energy prices, although consumer confidence dropped substantially after the storms. It will obviously be important to monitor consumer spending carefully in the months ahead, as higher energy prices show up in winter heating and electricity bills.\n\nIn addition to the uncertainties raised by higher energy prices, there are downside risks to economic growth relating to the housing market. This sector has been a key source of strength in the current expansion, and the concern is that, if house prices fell, the negative impact on household wealth could lead to a pullback in consumer spending. Certainly, analyses do indicate that house prices are abnormally high—that there is a “bubble” element, even accounting for factors that would support high house prices, such as low mortgage interest rates. So a reversal is certainly a possibility. Moreover, even the portion of house prices that is explained by low mortgage rates is at risk. There is a controversy about just why the rates have stayed so low. Over the past year, the Fed has raised the federal funds rate significantly. Normally, long-term interest rates also rise with increases in the expected path for the federal funds rate. But, long-term rates—such as those on 30-year fixed rate mortgages—have actually fallen over the period. This is what Chairman Greenspan has labelled a conundrum because there seems to be no convincing explanation for it. So, we can’t rule out the possibility that they would rise to a more normal relationship with short-term rates. This obviously might take some of the “oomph” out of the housing market. My bottom line is that while I’m certainly not predicting anything about future house price movements, I think it’s obvious that a substantial cooling off of the housing sector represents a downside risk to the outlook for growth.\n\nMy focus thus far has been on developments that relate to the Fed’s objective of keeping the economy growing and operating in the vicinity of full employment. However, like central banks worldwide, the Federal Reserve is also keenly focused on maintaining price stability. In my judgment, inflation has been relatively well-contained and essentially compatible with the Fed’s price stability objective, although rapid increases in energy prices over the past year have boosted headline CPI inflation to a whopping 4.7% over the last twelve months, a level not seen since 1991. Abstracting from volatile food and energy prices, however, core consumer price inflation, as measured by the CPI, registered a moderate 2.1 percent over the 12 months ending in September. A second key index of core consumer prices, the core PCE, or personal consumption expenditures index, also rose 2 percent over the 12 months ending in August. There is an anomaly here because the PCE price index typically rises about 0.5 percent less rapidly than the core CPI measure, and the aberrant difference between the two measures places inflation over the past 12 months, based on the core PCE, near the top of my comfort range. In contrast, over the past six months, core inflation has been more modest. The core PCE was up 1.6% at an annual rate in the six months ending in August—which is right near the middle of my preferred range. Core CPI inflation has been well behaved as well.\n\nThe question for policy, of course, concerns the future, not the past. Increases in energy prices, exacerbated by events in the Gulf Coast, are likely to continue boosting headline inflation. And a key question is whether higher energy prices also will elevate core inflation. In part, this depends on whether businesses are able to pass through higher energy and material prices or instead are forced to absorb them into the bottom line. Many of our contacts report that keen competition, coupled with healthy profit margins, is limiting their ability to pass these costs along. To the extent that there is some pass-through, however, core inflation could be higher, for a time. Even so, any boost in core inflation should prove transitory if energy prices stabilize unless—and it’s a big unless—these developments impact wage and salary developments in a broad-based way. Those of you who lived through the 1970s will remember that higher oil prices touched off a wage-price spiral that pushed inflation into double-digit territory. At this stage, wage and salary growth seems quite well-contained, and I see no evidence of feedbacks from energy prices to wage bargaining. The risk, though, is that, without appropriate policy, we could see a repetition of the 70’s type dynamic.\n\nNaturally, much research has gone into analyzing what happened during the 1970s, and I’m glad to report that there are major differences between now and then. One of the key findings concerns the role that inflation expectations play in generating the wage-price spiral. To sum up a great deal of research very briefly, the idea is that inflation expectations are like self-fulfilling prophecies. If people expect higher inflation, they will behave in the marketplace in ways that will actually generate higher inflation; for example, they will rush to make purchases thinking that tomorrow’s price will be higher than today’s. And, higher expected inflation will tend to be built into wage bargaining, which raises costs to businesses that, in turn, may get built into the prices of their products. Unwinding the inflationary spiral is no easy task. In the early 1980s, the Fed did it by slamming hard on the brakes. The costs of this action were high—the economy went through a double-dip recession, and the unemployment rate hit 10 percent in 1982. Since then, the Fed has continued to work to lower the inflation rate with considerable success. As a result, it appears that the public expects inflation to remain in a low range—as economists express it, inflation expectations have become “well anchored” to price stability.\n\nWhat’s the evidence on people’s inflation expectations? One source of information comes from responses to surveys about inflation expectations. A recent survey taken by the University of Michigan recorded a large jump in inflation expectations over the next twelve months, and a smaller increase in longer-term expectations. But I would not read too much into this, since the short-term survey results reflect recent energy price developments, and they also account for at least part of the uptick in longer-term expectations.\n\nAn alternative source of information on inflation expectations comes from analyses using a financial instrument that is called TIPS for short. This stands for Treasury Inflation-Protected Security, a class of government debt obligation that was first issued in 1997. The key feature of TIPS is that the payments to investors adjust automatically to compensate for the actual change in the CPI. Conventional Treasury securities, in contrast, do not provide such protection, so investors in those securities protect themselves by demanding nominal interest rates that compensate them for expected inflation as well as for bearing the risk that actual inflation could turn out to differ from their expectations. In principle, having information from both types of Treasury securities allows researchers to separate out the inflation compensation component embedded in nominal interest rates, and this provides a rough proxy for inflation expectations.1\n\nUsing this kind of analysis, we can obtain an estimate of inflation compensation over various time horizons. Not surprisingly, compensation for average inflation over the next five years has risen as energy prices have surged. However, it is notable that longer-term inflation expectations—those covering the period from five years ahead to ten years ahead—appear to have declined by half a percentage point since the Fed began tightening policy. This development supports the view that the public has confidence in the FOMC’s commitment to price stability, even in the face of a large energy price shock. However, the Federal Reserve cannot take it for granted that inflation expectations will remain well-contained. Rather, it is the job of a central bank to earn, through its actions, the public’s confidence in its commitment to price stability.\n\nThis brings me to a discussion of recent Fed actions. Over the past sixteen months, with the U.S. economy growing slightly above trend and unemployment gradually declining toward normal levels, the Federal Open Market Committee has been lifting its foot off the monetary accelerator at a measured pace—bit by bit. We’ve been gradually removing the policy accommodation that had been put in place during the 2001 recession and then held there during the slow recovery when there was even a risk of deflation. The objective of these policy actions has been to position the economy on a trajectory characterized by “full employment” and price stability—the two main policy goals articulated in the Federal Reserve Act. As slack in labor markets is absorbed, real output growth must converge toward a sustainable long-run pace for inflation to remain under control. This, in turn, requires that monetary policy revert to a so-called “neutral” stance.\n\nAfter eleven 25-basis point upward moves since June 2004, the federal funds rate now stands at 3.75 percent, so the question of exactly what constitutes a neutral stance has become more compelling. Conceptually, policy can be deemed “neutral” when the federal funds rate reaches a level that is consistent with full employment of labor and capital resources over the intermediate run. The value of this rate depends on the strength of spending—that is, the aggregate demand for U.S. produced goods and services. Aggregate demand, in turn, depends on a number of factors. These include fiscal policy; the pace of growth in our main trading partners; movements in asset prices, such as stocks and housing, that influence the propensity of households to save and spend; the slope of the yield curve, which determines the levels of long-term interest rates associated with any given value of the federal funds rate; and the pace of technological change, which influences investment spending. The neutral value of the federal funds rate also depends on, and rises roughly in tandem with, inflation itself, because it is mainly inflation-adjusted, or real, not nominal interest rates, that influence spending.\n\nThe neutral rate is easy to define conceptually, but it’s difficult to know in practice when we’re there, because estimates of the neutral rate are highly uncertain and the factors influencing that rate can change over time.2 That said, a number of different techniques can be used to estimate the neutral rate and, based on such estimates, I consider it reasonable to put the current neutral rate in the range of 3-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent. At 3-3/4 percent, the current federal funds rate is toward the lower end of this band. This suggests a presumption that the rate will need to be raised further. Indeed, financial markets now appear to expect the funds rate to peak at about 4½ percent—in the middle of this neutral range. Again though, I want to emphasize that there is no way to know precisely what the neutral stance is.\n\nTo my mind this means that, as the federal funds rate target nears a reasonable estimate of the neutral rate, monetary policy must become more and more dependent on incoming data relating to the strength of aggregate spending. It is equally important, of course, to monitor developments relating to inflation, because the very notion that a neutral policy stance is appropriate is premised on the assumption that inflation is and will remain well-contained in a zone corresponding to price stability.\n\nThe ideal trajectory for the economy and the funds rate that I have described remains a plausible, even probable, scenario. At its September meeting, the risks engendered by Hurricane Katrina were very much on the minds of Committee members. Sharp jumps in energy prices always put U.S. monetary policy on the horns of a dilemma. On one side, the negative impact on spending tends to damp economic activity, which calls for a more accommodative policy, although in this case, the rebuilding effort will provide an important offset. On the other side, higher energy prices add to inflationary pressures, potentially calling for a tighter policy. Although the effects of Katrina and Rita will remain uncertain for some time and the storms may alter the pattern of growth over the next year or so, it seems likely that economy will prove resilient in the medium term. With long-term inflation expectations still well-contained, the prospects for core inflation over the medium term also, to my mind, look favorable. It thus made sense to me to continue the gradual removal of policy accommodation.\n\nGoing forward, it will be necessary to continue to monitor developments closely and weigh options carefully. As I noted, the data dependence of policy becomes more critical the closer we get to a neutral stance. One option that is clearly not on the table is allowing an unacceptable rise in inflation. It has taken many years of consistent performance for the Federal Reserve to earn the public’s confidence in its commitment to price stability, and this consistency of purpose remains essential.\n\n# # #\n\n1.

Indeed, I’m always eager to accept invitations to speak in London, because it was my home many years ago, when I was on the faculty of the London School of Economics. I came to know and love the city then, and I’m always happy to return.\n\nMy main topics today are the U.S. economy and the Federal Open Market Committee’s conduct of monetary policy. I’d like to start with conditions in the U.S. economy, including output growth and employment as well as inflation. I’ll review the recent past and indicate my sense of the likely path going forward, along with some of the risks that I see—especially energy and house prices, concerns that our two countries share in common. I’ll conclude with some thoughts on the course of monetary policy in the U.S.\n\nObviously, at the forefront of everyone’s mind are the two huge hurricanes that recently struck the U.S. Gulf Coast. The human tragedy following Katrina is enormous. I know the nation is grateful for the outpouring of sympathy and tangible support from the rest of the world, not the least of which is your own country’s offer of food, expert personnel, and search-and-rescue gear. We all mourn the loss of life, and we are working to alleviate the dire conditions for many of the survivors. The economic consequences for the region, of course, also are enormous. Katrina displaced millions of people, disrupted or destroyed thousands of businesses and jobs, and wrought severe damage on much of the infrastructure. Hurricane Rita, of course, has compounded the economic damage, however, early reports indicate little lasting effect on energy production, refining, and distribution.\n\nStaring into the face of such disasters, it is natural at first to want to use every tool at hand to try to help, including monetary policy. However, it seems clear that where monetary policy can make its greatest contribution is in keeping the national economy on an even keel. Monetary policy, unfortunately, has little scope to cushion the immediate economic fallout because monetary actions can’t be directed only at a particular area of the country and because their effects take time to be felt. Instead, it’s appropriate to use the tools of fiscal policy—especially government spending and transfers—to address the immediate crisis.\n\nWhen Hurricane Katrina hit at the end of August, the economy was actually doing reasonably well. Over the preceding two and a half years, real GDP had grown steadily at, or above, its long-run sustainable pace, which, based on continued robust structural productivity, is estimated at three to three and a quarter percent. And in the second quarter, the latest for which we have data, the preliminary estimate looks similar—that is, real GDP grew by three and a quarter percent. With this stretch of near or above-trend growth in economic activity, slack in resource use has gradually, but steadily, diminished—that is, jobs have grown and capacity utilization has risen. According to the latest data, which are for August, and therefore before the storm, the U.S. unemployment rate was at 4.9 percent, a number that’s near conventional estimates consistent with so-called “full employment.”\n\nAs this scenario has unfolded—above-trend growth and diminishing slack—the FOMC has been able to lift its foot off the accelerator bit by bit, gradually removing the policy accommodation that had been put in place during the 2001 recession and then held there during the slow recovery when there was a risk of deflation. At each of its last 11 meetings—including the one last week—the Committee raised the federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point, bringing it to three and three-quarters percent today.\n\nThe goal of these policy actions, of course, is to establish a solid trajectory for the economy going forward. As slack in labor markets is absorbed, real output growth must converge toward its potential rate for inflation to remain under control, which, in turn, requires that monetary policy reach a so-called “neutral” stance. Such a trajectory still remains a plausible, even probable, scenario. However, looking ahead I’d say there are a number uncertainties and risks that could complicate things considerably, and these were evident even before the havoc unleashed by Hurricane Katrina.\n\nHeading my list of risks to the economy in both the near and medium-term is energy prices. In the two years before Katrina struck, energy prices had surged worldwide, with the price of oil more than doubling and even spiking at one point to over $70 per barrel. The macroeconomic effect of higher energy prices is to dampen aggregate demand, as the additional dollars people spend for the same amount of gasoline, natural gas, heating oil, and so on, take away from their spending on other goods and services. Likewise, firms feel the bite in terms of their profit margins or the dollars they would have spent on investment in plant and equipment.\n\nThe intensity of this dampening effect depends importantly on whether the higher prices are viewed as transitory—a passing phenomenon—or as a more permanent feature of the economic landscape. If transitory, then consumers and firms will tend to maintain something close to their usual level of spending while the higher prices last—perhaps by dipping into their reserves. If higher energy prices are expected to persist, however, a deeper and longer-lasting cutback in spending is more likely.\n\nTo gauge the perception of the permanence of higher energy prices, the natural place to look is at futures prices. Even before Katrina, they suggested that higher prices may be here to stay. During the run-up of spot prices over the past year and a half, far-dated oil futures prices rose sharply. Most likely, these futures prices reflected the sense that global demand for oil would remain strong in an environment where there is little excess supply available and where geopolitical uncertainty creates risks to existing supplies.\n\nWith first Katrina and then Rita slamming into the Gulf Coast, the energy situation naturally has become even more severe, since that area has such an extensive drilling, refining, and distribution infrastructure. For example, offshore crude oil and natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico accounts for approximately 29 percent and 19 percent, respectively, of total U.S. production levels. Importantly, Gulf Coast refineries account for a whopping 47 percent of total U.S. refining capacity. While futures prices gyrated a lot around the time both hurricanes struck, since then, they’ve settled back to roughly their pre-hurricane levels.\n\nBefore Hurricane Katrina, the outlook was for very strong growth in the second half of this year, with a return to trend-like growth in 2006. Indeed, a concern at the time was that the economy’s momentum was sufficiently strong that it might overshoot full employment, adding to inflationary pressures. The damage and destruction from the hurricanes have significantly raised uncertainties about the outlook through three main channels. One is the immediate and direct effects on businesses and jobs in the Gulf Coast region; the second is the longer-term effects of higher energy prices on consumer and business spending throughout the nation; the third is the spending devoted to rebuilding the affected area.\n\nThe direct effects will alter the near-term trajectory of the national economy. These disruptions seem very likely to put a noticeable dent in overall U.S. growth in the second half, which will only be partly offset by increased government spending for reconstruction. Most estimates of the size of the dent run around half a percent, and that seems about right to me. This suggests that growth in the second half may be only modestly above the potential rate.\n\nTurning to 2006, it seems likely that growth will rebound as energy production comes fully back on line and rebuilding kicks in. However, the magnitude of the rebound is highly uncertain, with considerable risks on both the upside and downside. Estimates of the extent of spending are escalating, and the recovery and bounce-back—fueled by massive fiscal stimulus—could propel the U.S. economy on an unsustainable upward trajectory. Alternatively, the recovery could proceed less quickly and less vigorously than one might hope over the next few months. Even before Rita, the pace of restarting closed oil and natural gas platforms and rigs in the Gulf of Mexico damaged by Katrina had leveled off, and the prognosis for restarting the remaining closed facilities, as well as refineries and natural gas treatment plants, remained in question. It is too soon to say which of these risks might materialize. Some reports say the recovery in oil and natural gas production and in oil refining is moving ahead faster than expected. At the same time, facilities in the region are still operating well below capacity.\n\n* * * *\n\nTurning to inflation, the data on core price inflation covering the months before Katrina were encouraging. Despite rapid increases in energy prices, prices for core personal consumption expenditures rose at only a 1-1/2 percent rate over the six months through July, right in the middle of my preferred range. Core CPI inflation has been well behaved as well. Of course, six months of data do not make a trend, and forthcoming data bear continued close scrutiny, but what I’ve seen so far gives me some reassurance that unacceptably high inflation remains just a risk, not the most likely outcome.\n\nAnother encouraging development is that labor compensation is still growing at a modest pace. This suggests that at least some slack remains in labor markets, a good sign for inflation going forward. Labor compensation growth, as measured by the Employment Cost Index and measures of wages and salaries drawn from the employment surveys, remains remarkably subdued. An alternative index of compensation growth that includes bonuses and stock options, from the Productivity and Cost report, indicates an elevated rate of growth in compensation per hour over the past year, but my sense is that this may be more an outlier than a strong signal of tight labor markets and wage pressure.\n\nEvents in the Gulf Coast obviously will tend to push up headline inflation through higher energy prices. An important question concerns the extent to which higher energy prices will work their way into core inflation—that is, excluding energy and food prices. There is a chance that core inflation may be raised for a time, as a part of the rise in energy prices gets passed through to other goods and services. However, a more persistent increase in inflation, such as was witnessed during the 1970s, seems unlikely as long as inflation expectations remain well contained.\n\nDuring the 1970s, higher oil prices touched off a wage-price spiral which was costly to unwind. In contrast, U.S. experience since the early 1980s reveals no evidence of passthrough from real energy prices to core inflation. The crucial difference seems to be that, during the 1970s, the public’s inflation expectations became unmoored from price stability, whereas, since the early 1980s, they have been well-anchored. Evidence comes from the relative stability of longer-term inflation expectations as derived from the market for inflation-protected Treasury securities this year, even as oil prices surged. This stability supports the view that the public has confidence in the FOMC’s commitment to price stability. A recent consumer confidence survey recorded a worrisome jump in inflation expectations, but I would not read too much into this, since the survey was conducted so soon after Katrina.\n\nGiven these considerations, I wouldn’t be surprised to see core PCE inflation actually fall a bit over the next two years and to see the longer-run trend settle in near the center of my 1 to 2 percent comfort zone. However, the Federal Reserve cannot take it for granted that inflation expectations will remain well-contained. Rather, it is the job of a central bank to earn, through its actions, the public’s confidence in its commitment to price stability.\n\n* * * *\n\nIn addition to energy prices, the huge and unsustainable current account deficit and the budget deficit pose longer-term risks to the U.S. economic outlook. Indeed, the latter is even more of an issue now, with the massive rebuilding plans for the Gulf Coast. But I want to focus my remarks today on another longer-term issue, namely, the housing market, as this is a situation that has also been a concern in the U.K.\n\nThe share of residential investment in GDP is now at its highest level in decades, and this sector has been a key source of strength in the current expansion. The question is: will this source of strength reverse course and become instead a source of weakness? Put more bluntly: Is there a house-price “bubble” that might collapse, and if so, what would that mean for the U.S. economy? To answer this question, let me begin by clarifying what I mean by the term “bubble.” A bubble does not just mean that prices are rising rapidly—it’s more complicated than that. Instead, a bubble means that the price of an asset—in this case, housing—is significantly higher than its fundamental value.\n\nOne common way of thinking about housing’s fundamental value is to consider the ratio of housing prices to rents. The price-to-rent ratio is equivalent to the price-to-dividend ratio for stocks. In the case of housing, rents reflect the flow of benefits obtained from housing assets—either the monetary return from rental property, or the value of living in owner-occupied housing. Historically, the ratio for the U.S. has had many ups and downs, but over time it has tended to return to its long-run average. In other words, when the price-to-rent ratio is high, housing prices tend to grow more slowly or fall for a time, and when the ratio is low, prices tend to rise more rapidly. I want to emphasize, though, that this is a loose relationship that can be counted on only for rough guidance rather than a precise reading.\n\nCurrently, the ratio for the U.S. is higher than at any time since data became available in 1970—about 25 percent above its long-run average. Of course, the results vary widely from place to place in the U.S. and in different countries. For Los Angeles and San Francisco, the price-to-rent ratio is about 40 percent higher than the normal level, while for Cleveland the ratio is very near its historical average. For the U.K., the ratio is more than double its long-run average, whereas in Japan it’s only about three-quarters of its normal level.1\n\nHigher than normal ratios do not necessarily prove that there’s a house-price bubble. House prices could be high for some good, fundamental reasons. For example, in the U.S. recent changes in tax laws may be having an effect. In 1998, tax rates on capital gains were lowered and the exemption from capital gains taxation for housing was raised to $500,000. Both of these changes would reduce the potential tax bite from selling one home and buying another. Another development, which may be making housing more like an investment vehicle in the U.S., is that it’s now easier and cheaper to get at the equity—either through refinancing, which has become a less costly process, or through an equity line of credit. Both of these innovations in mortgage markets make the funds invested in houses more liquid.\n\nProbably the most obvious candidate for a fundamental factor—in the U.S.and in the U.K. —is low mortgage interest rates. But in the U.S, this phenomenon raises some issues of its own because there is a controversy about just why the rates have stayed so low. As I’ve said, over the past year, the Fed has raised the federal funds rate significantly. Normally, long-term interest rates also rise with increases in the expected path for the federal funds rate. But, long-term rates—such as those on 30-year fixed rate mortgages—have actually fallen over the period. This is what Chairman Greenspan has labelled a conundrum because there seems to be no convincing explanation for it.\n\nWhile the fundamentals I’ve mentioned do play a role, the consensus seems to be that much of the unusually high price-to-rent ratio for housing remains unexplained. Moreover, with controversy over exactly why long-term interest rates have remained so low, we can’t rule out the possibility that they would rise to a more normal relationship with short-term rates, and this obviously might take some of the “oomph” out of the housing market. So, while I’m certainly not predicting anything about future house price movements, I think it’s obvious that the housing sector represents a risk to the U.S. outlook.\n\nThis brings me to the debate about how monetary policy should react to unusually high prices of houses—or other assets, for that matter. I know you’re all familiar with the issues, as they have been in the public spotlight here in the United Kingdom for some time. But let me frame them briefly. As a starting point, the issue is not whether policy should react at all; I believe there is quite general agreement that policy should be calibrated to the wealth effects of house prices on output and inflation. The debate lies in determining when, if ever, policy should be focused on deflating the asset price bubble itself.2\n\nIn my view, the weight of a decision to deflate an asset price bubble rests on positive answers to three questions. First, if the bubble were to collapse on its own, would the effect on the economy be exceedingly large? Second, is it unlikely that the Fed could mitigate the consequences? Third, is monetary policy the best tool to use to deflate a house-price bubble?\n\nMy answers to these questions in the shortest possible form are, “no,” “no,” and “no.” In the most thorough possible form, my answers might take a few hours, and would give full play to the many gray areas that are involved. Since the short answer is not satisfactory and the thorough one overwhelms our time limits, I will compromise and give just a brief explanation for my trio of “nos.”\n\nIn answer to the first question on the size of the effect, it could be large enough to feel like a good-sized bump in the road, but the economy would likely to be able to absorb the shock.. For example, a reversion to the long-run price-rent ratio would appear to represent a shock that is only about half the size of U.S. stock market collapse in 2000 and 2001.\n\nIn answer to the second question on timing, the spending slowdown that would ensue is likely to kick in gradually, because it mainly affects household wealth. That would give the Fed time to cushion the impact with an easier policy.\n\nIn answer to the third question on whether monetary policy is the best tool to deflate a house-price bubble, there are several points to consider. For one thing, no one can predict exactly how much tightening would be needed, or by exactly how much the bubble should be reduced. Beyond that, a tighter policy to deflate a housing bubble could impose substantial costs on other sectors of the economy that would lead to equally unwelcome imbalances. Finally, it’s possible that other strategies, such as tighter supervision or changes in financial regulation, would not only be more tailored to the problem, but also less costly to the economy.\n\nTaking all of these points into consideration, it seems that the arguments against trying to deflate a bubble outweigh those in favor of it. So, my bottom line is that monetary policy should react to rising prices for houses or other assets only insofar as they affect the central bank’s goal variables—output, employment, and inflation. But let me stress that the debate surrounding these issues is still very much alive.\n\n* * * *\n\nI’d like to wrap up with a few thoughts on U.S. monetary policy, and particularly on last week’s policy meeting. Of course, the risks engendered by Hurricane Katrina were very much on our minds and added to an already challenging situation. Higher energy prices put U.S. monetary policy on the horns of a dilemma. On one side, the negative impact of higher energy prices on spending tends to damp economic activity, which calls for a more accommodative policy, although in this case, the rebuilding effort will provide some offset. On the other side, it adds to inflationary pressures, which calls for a tighter policy.\n\nAlthough the effects of Katrina and Rita will remain uncertain for some time, it appears that the most likely outcome is a significant dip in growth in this quarter and the next, stemming both from the direct loss of activity in the Gulf Coast region and the rise in energy prices, followed by a rebound in the first half of next year as the region rebuilds. Given this best guess, it made sense to me to continue the gradual removal of policy accommodation. So, for the eleventh straight meeting, the Committee voted to increase the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.\n\nGoing forward, the Committee will certainly continue to monitor developments closely and weigh the options carefully. One option that is clearly not on the table is allowing an unacceptable rise in inflation. It has taken many years of consistent performance for the Federal Reserve to earn the public’s confidence in its commitment to price stability. As William Pitt, the Elder, once said, “Confidence is a plant of slow growth.” I would add that it is also a plant that needs constant nurturing; in other words, to maintain its credibility, the Federal Reserve must deliver—again and again–on its commitment to price stability.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

            "content": "It’s a pleasure to be here with you in San Diego. My remarks today will focus on the nation’s economy and the implications for monetary policy. As I was preparing for this event a few weeks ago, I originally had in mind a fairly upbeat talk about an economy that was in reasonably good shape. Since then, of course, a great deal has happened. The country has come face to face with a natural disaster of enormous proportions, particularly in terms of the human tragedy that has occurred in its wake. Our thoughts and best wishes are with those in the Gulf Coast and with their families, and, indeed, with those who have gone to help.\n\nWith a disaster of this magnitude, the economic effects go well beyond New Orleans, Gulfport, Biloxi, and all the other devastated towns and cities in the hurricane’s path. Clearly, there are national implications, since that region is an important hub for exports and imports and an important center for the oil and gas industries. Since the effects of Hurricane Katrina are of national economic significance, I certainly plan to discuss how I believe they might factor into decisions about monetary policy.\n\nBut there is more to the story of the Federal Reserve’s response than just monetary policy. And I’d like to take a moment to tell you a little about it. First let me note that the Federal Reserve itself was among those institutions that felt this disaster directly. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta has a Branch Office in the city of New Orleans. The building was closed after safely evacuating all but a small crew to maintain security. That Branch Office, like others around the country, plays an important role in keeping cash and checks moving through the nation’s payments system. Though that building is closed for business, the functions are definitely ongoing thanks to the efforts of Fed staff in neighboring locations, including Birmingham, Memphis, and Houston. The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco is involved, too, because the national responsibility for the Fed’s cash operations resides with the Cash Product Office of our Bank, directed by Mark Mullinix, who heads our Los Angeles office. Obviously, the immediate job is to make sure that there are adequate cash inventories available to meet demand. This has involved bringing into play many contingency plans, such as extending the hours of the cash shops involved to include weekends, beefing up the inventory of currency available for payout by drawing on excess currency in other parts of the country, and freeing up currency that was stored in a non-Fed location in the event of just such an emergency. All told, nearly three quarters of a billion dollars have been paid out through these alternative arrangements. For the check business, similar contingency plans have been put into place, as well as some extension of credit for banks in the area that have not been able to reopen.\n\nAnother way that the Fed is working to keep the financial system in that region on a sound footing is by joining with other regulators and affected financial institutions to identify customer needs and monitor institutions’ restoration of services. Along with other regulators, the Fed recently issued a statement urging depository institutions to consider all prudent and reasonable actions that could help meet the critical financial needs of their customers and their communities. This includes allowing loan customers to defer or skip some payments, easing credit card limits and credit terms for new loans, raising ATM withdrawal limits, and relaxing restrictions on cashing out-of-state and non-customer checks.\n\nNow let me turn to the economy and monetary policy. Even before Hurricane Katrina and all that has followed, I would have said that the conduct of monetary policy had reached a challenging phase. We had gone through a period in which inflation was well contained but the economy had a lot of slack. In that phase, it was obvious that policy needed to be highly accommodative. Then, as slack diminished, it seemed equally obvious that the Fed needed to gradually remove policy accommodation—”normalizing” the stance of monetary policy. The goals of these policy actions, of course, are to set the economy on track so that inflation stays low and excess slack in the labor market is absorbed. As that occurs, real output growth must converge toward its potential rate for inflation to remain under control, which, in turn, requires that monetary policy reach a so-called neutral stance. Such a trajectory still remains a plausible, even probable, scenario. However, as we’ve come closer to these goals, the appropriate policies are not as obvious as they were before, as the potential for undershooting or overshooting the goals looms larger. Indeed, uncertainties and risks that could complicate things considerably were evident even before the havoc unleashed by Hurricane Katrina, so our approach during this phase must be particularly dependent on information from incoming data.\n\nAs for the impact of the situation in the Gulf Coast on policy, there are a couple of ideas I’ll expand on later in my remarks, but I’d like to state them briefly here. In my view, the greatest contribution monetary policy can make is to keep the national economy on an even keel. Monetary policy, unfortunately, has little scope to cushion the immediate economic fallout from such a severe and sudden blow to a region, because monetary actions can’t be directed at a particular area of the country, and their effects take time to be felt. It is fiscal policy—government spending and transfers—that is necessary to address the immediate needs of the affected areas. Monetary policy may come into play, however, in counteracting those impacts from the hurricane that continue over time and affect the country as a whole. I’m thinking particularly of the hurricane’s effects on energy prices, which could be a threat if their effects are long-lasting. The Gulf Coast is important to our nation’s energy supplies, and the associated problems are coming at a time when oil prices were already high. I’ll come back to this issue after briefly reviewing recent economic developments—indicating where the economy has been and how policy has responded.\n\nBeginning on the real side of the economy, the nation’s output growth has averaged about three and one-half percent over the past year, a rate that is moderately above trend, which is now probably around three to three and a quarter percent. The national unemployment rate has gradually dropped to 4.9 percent, which is near conventional estimates of the natural rate consistent with “full employment.”\n\nThis growth has been achieved in the face of some significant drags on economic activity—a growing trade gap, a very cautious environment around business investment, and, of course, high oil prices. That is why, as I mentioned earlier, the Committee kept its main policy instrument, the federal funds rate, very low for quite some time in the wake of the last recession.\n\nFocusing on oil prices, they have more than doubled in the past year and a half and recently spiked above $70 a barrel. Over the last several decades, most fluctuations in oil prices have proven to be “transitory” and, not surprisingly, the view that oil price jumps will be temporary is typically reflected in futures prices. During the run-up of spot oil prices over the past year and a half, in contrast, far-dated oil futures prices also have increased sharply, suggesting that high oil prices may be here to stay. This is a highly unusual development. It probably reflects the perception that global demand will remain strong in an environment where there is little excess supply of oil available in the world and where geopolitical uncertainty creates risks to existing supplies. High oil prices, of course, impose a tax on consumers that erodes their spending power while impinging on businesses’ bottom lines. The perception that the on-going oil price shock is more permanent tends to intensify its negative spending impacts. However, it is worth emphasizing that, after adjusting for inflation, the current price of oil is still well below the inflation-adjusted peak price reached during the oil shocks in the early 1980s. Moreover, the energy intensity of the U.S. economy is far lower than it was in those days.\n\nTo offset the negative impact on spending stemming from oil and the other drags I mentioned, monetary policy had to remain highly accommodative for a substantial period—stimulating interest-sensitive sectors, particularly consumer durables and housing. Over time, however, as slack in resource use diminished—that is, jobs have grown and capacity utilization has risen—the FOMC has gradually been able to lift its foot off the accelerator, removing policy accommodation. At each of its last ten meetings, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point, bringing it to three and a half percent today.\n\nAs I said, during the process of removing accommodation, incoming data have become increasingly influential in my own assessments of the further policy measures that are needed to move the economy toward this desirable trajectory.\n\nFor example, data during the late spring and early summer suggested that aggregate demand was stronger than had been previously thought, implying greater momentum in spending. Moreover, the data showed a drop in the pace of inventory accumulation, especially for autos. Therefore, most forecasters were predicting fairly rapid growth for the second half of the year, as firms rebuild their inventories, with a return to trend-like growth in 2006. This potential for a bulge in growth in the second half of 2005—with labor markets apparently already near full employment—was seen as raising inflationary risks.\n\nNow, of course, developments in the Gulf Coast come into play, altering the expected pattern for the national output data. Disruption of production in the Gulf will undoubtedly slow growth somewhat in the second half—a common estimate is that it will depress national real GDP growth by around one-half to three-quarters percent. This is likely to be followed by a surge in growth as the government-assisted rebuilding kicks in—hopefully before too long.\n\nIn addition to these effects relating directly to the Gulf Coast area, however, there has been the potential for negative impacts on national spending due to the spike in energy prices that occurred right after the hurricane. The Gulf Coast plays a significant role in the country’s energy supply because of its extensive drilling, refining, and distribution infrastructure. For example, offshore crude oil and natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico account for approximately 29 percent and 19 percent respectively of total U.S. production levels. Importantly, Gulf Coast refineries account for a whopping 47 percent of total U.S. refining capacity.\n\nHigher energy prices, as I mentioned, sap the spending power of both households and businesses over other goods and services. These effects tend to hit the economy gradually with long lags and are one of the factors that the Fed routinely takes into consideration in conducting monetary policy. Like all so-called negative supply shocks, an energy shock presents complex choices for monetary policy. It reduces output and employment for a time, which calls for easier policy, but it also temporarily raises inflation, which calls for tighter policy. Moreover, the size of these two effects is difficult to gauge in advance. Part of the difficulty is that the impact depends on whether people see the latest rise in oil prices as short-lived or longer-lasting. The longer-lasting the effects are seen to be, the bigger the effect on spending.\n\nFortunately, there is growing evidence of recovery in the energy infrastructure along the Gulf Coast. Although many refineries and pipelines were affected initially, reports indicate that more and more are coming on line. In addition, after the steep run-up in energy prices, both spot and futures prices have retreated significantly.\n\nLet me now turn from the real side of the economy to inflation, again emphasizing how incoming data have influenced my own assessment of the appropriate path for monetary policy. I’ll focus particularly on something called the personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding food and energy. I realize I just said a mouthful, and I apologize. But it’s important to mention it, because it’s a comprehensive measure of core consumer inflation that the Fed carefully monitors. That measure rose by 1-3/4 percent over the last 12 months, suggesting that inflation has been relatively well-contained over the past year. And core inflation has dipped a bit over the last few months.\n\nOf course, the issue for policy is not so much where inflation was in the past, but rather where inflation is headed. In this regard, it seems likely that, even with inflation expectations well contained—which they have been according to most indicators—higher oil prices may be partly passed through to core inflation at least for a time. Supply disruptions emanating from the Gulf Coast disaster may also affect the prices of building materials and transportation services. Two further key influences on inflation are productivity growth and the pace of compensation growth, since both affect the behavior of business costs. Recent data revisions lowered estimates of productivity growth over 2001 to 2004 somewhat and reveal a deceleration in productivity growth over the past year or so. These revisions probably warrant a modest decrease in our estimates of structural productivity growth—the underlying noncyclical portion of productivity which is most relevant in assessing inflationary pressures. That said, it’s very encouraging that even after a downward adjustment, structural productivity still appears to be growing somewhat faster than the robust rates achieved in the second half of the 1990s, and it remains quite strong by historical standards.\n\nWith respect to labor compensation, my sense from the data and our business contacts is that cost pressures remain in check, although recent data also give conflicting signals. One key measure, the Employment Cost Index, has recorded only modest increases over the past year. A second more inclusive measure of compensation shows a more substantial rise. It is also worth noting that, over the last few years, an unusual situation has emerged in which profits have risen at an exceptionally rapid pace in comparison with labor income, pushing up capital’s share of GDP to a very high level by historical standards. A more rapid rise in compensation per hour could be part of the process by which labor’s share of income returns to more normal levels, hence unthreatening from an inflation standpoint. As we assess the likely behaviour of wage pressures going forward, we must also factor in the influence of slack in labor and product markets. The decline in the unemployment rate to 4.9 percent in August, coupled with some improvement in measures such as the employment-population ratio and industrial capacity utilization, suggest that while a “whisker” of slack may still remain, we probably can’t count on slack to hold inflation down.\n\nTaking all of these factors into account, my overall assessment is that core inflation—that is, excluding food and energy—seems relatively well contained at the present time. However, there are a myriad of uncertainties about how things will unfold over the next year or two, and the uncertainties on the upside have only gotten bigger since Hurricane Katrina slammed into the Gulf Coast.\n\nIn addition to the uncertainties I’ve already mentioned, there is, of course, the housing market. With the share of residential investment in GDP now at its highest level in decades, a key question is whether this source of strength in the economy could reverse course and become instead a source of weakness. One common way of thinking about housing valuations is to consider the ratio of housing prices to rents. The price-to-rent ratio is equivalent to the price-to-dividend ratio for stocks. Historically, the ratio for the nation as a whole has had many ups and downs, but over time it has tended to return to its long-run average. Thus, when the price-to-rent ratio is high, housing prices tend to grow more slowly or fall for a time, and when the ratio is low, prices tend to rise more rapidly. I want to emphasize, though, that this is a loose relationship that can be counted on only for rough guidance rather than a precise reading.\n\nIn the San Diego area, the very rapid increase in house prices over the past few years has pushed the ratio well above its long-run average, making it among the highest in the nation. Of course, a high ratio in this area does not necessarily mean that one should expect a commensurately large price adjustment going forward. There are striking regional variations in house-price appreciation, and some areas may have high relative prices for good fundamental reasons. For example, an area like San Diego may not have much room to expand the housing stock as demand grows. And given how attractive San Diego is, demand may be expected to keep rising in the future as well. Of course, I’m not making any predictions about house prices here or anywhere else. I’m only pointing out some issues that should be considered.\n\nFor the nation, the price-to-rent ratio is higher than at any time since data became available in 1982. The natural question to ask is can such a high value be explained by fundamentals? Probably the most obvious candidate for a fundamental factor is low mortgage interest rates. And the phenomenon of low long-term interest rates raises some issues of its own because there is a controversy about just why they have stayed so low. As I’ve said, over the past year, the Fed has raised the federal funds rate significantly. Normally, long-term interest rates also rise with increases in the expected path for the federal funds rate. But, long-term rates—such as those on 30-year fixed rate mortgages—have actually fallen over the period. This is what Chairman Greenspan has labelled a conundrum because there seems to be no convincing explanation for it.\n\nWhile low mortgage rates explain part of the unusually high price-to-rent ratio nationally, the consensus seems to be that mortgage rates are not low enough to explain much of the run-up in the ratio. Moreover, with controversy over exactly why long-term interest rates have remained so low, we can’t rule out the possibility that they would rise to a more normal relationship with short-term rates, and this obviously might take some of the “oomph” out of the housing market. So, while I’m certainly not predicting anything about future house price movements, I think it’s obvious that the housing sector represents a risk to the outlook.\n\nLet me close by summarizing where I think the economy is now heading and the role of monetary policy in guiding its evolution. I have emphasized in this talk that a number of risks cloud the outlook. The tragic disaster in the Gulf region tops the list of risks to the national economy at this stage, given the importance of this area to energy, trade, and transportation. I have also discussed risks relating to housing markets and the current configuration of interest rates. Even taking these risks into account, the economy overall, in my estimation, is doing reasonably well and could settle into a highly desirable pattern of full employment, trend-like real GDP growth, and well-contained inflation. The job of monetary policy is to foster exactly such an outcome.\n\nIt is worth recognizing that the U.S. economy has shown great resilience in the face of other disasters with national impacts, such as 9/11, Hurricane Andrew, and the Northridge earthquake. Of course, the toll from Hurricane Katrina has already proved to be staggering in human terms and, in this instance, the national economy will be affected through the region’s key role in trade and energy markets. The size of these impacts depends in part on how quickly the vast energy infrastructure in the region can be brought back to operating condition. While recent indicators provide room for optimism, we are still at an early stage in the process of assessing the effects of the hurricane.\n\nThere are no easy answers as this stage. I hope I’ve given you some insight into what kinds of things we will be looking at over the period ahead.\n\n# # #"

            "content": "Thank you for that very kind introduction. It’s a pleasure to be here with you in this beautiful “City of Roses.” As a monetary policymaker, my main concern is the national economy, and that will be the chief focus of my remarks today. But as President of the San Francisco Fed, I also pay close attention to developments here in the Twelfth District, which, in many respects, mirror those of the nation.\n\nLooking at the big picture elements—growth, employment, and inflation—I’d say things are in reasonably good shape. Over the past two years, the nation’s output growth has been pretty steady, averaging just over four percent; this is solidly above trend, which, by most estimates, is around three and a quarter to three and a half percent. This growth has been amply in evidence here in the Pacific Northwest. While unemployment rates in Oregon and Washington remain above the nation’s rate, your region has largely recovered from the severe hit you took during the 2001 recession and its aftermath. As a result of sustained growth at the national level, slack in labor and product markets has trended down. At 5.0 percent, the national unemployment rate now stands near conventional estimates of the natural rate consistent with “full employment.” When it comes to inflation, I focus on core measures, which exclude the volatile food and energy components, to assess underlying trends. Two different measures of core inflation have given slightly different signals in recent months: one—the core CPI—is well within my comfort zone; the other—the core PCE—is at the upper end. However, I expect to see some moderation in inflation going forward. Similarly, most forecasters expect the pace of economic activity also to moderate toward trend-like growth. Given all this, it seems to me that the economy is on track to achieve price stability and “maximum employment”—the dual goals assigned to monetary policy by the Federal Reserve Act—and that we’ll likely continue to move in a positive direction over the next couple of years.\n\nThis sounds like a rosy scenario and I realize that it ignores all of the things that could go wrong. You might well ask, “What about oil prices?” “What about the record trade deficit?” “What about the possibility of a housing bubble?” “What about the ‘conundrum’ of surprisingly low long-term interest rates?” Well, indeed—what about them? You would be right to ask. These questions touch on important economic developments that create risks for the positive scenario I just described. They therefore receive serious attention at the policy table. From my perspective, trying to assess such risks is what makes the conduct of monetary policy both interesting and challenging.\n\nInflation risks\nLet me start by looking at some of the factors that create risks for the inflation outlook and explain why I’m nevertheless fairly optimistic that inflation will moderate over the next few years. Of course, oil prices do pose an inflation risk. The price of oil has just about doubled over the past two years, from the low $30 range to around $60 per barrel recently. Higher oil prices are reflected in higher “headline” inflation. And they have been passed through to some extent to core inflation as well, but, unless they rise further, the effect on core inflation should begin to dissipate next year. Another risk relates to labor compensation, which is the single largest component of business costs. Recently, one measure of compensation per hour jumped abruptly. Here, too, though, I am not terribly worried because a good part of the jump is probably accounted for by one-time events, such as bonus payments and the exercising of stock options. This interpretation is supported by readings from an alternative measure of labor compensation, the Employment Cost Index, which excludes these items and has recorded only modest increases.\n\nI’m also quite encouraged by several developments that portend a moderation in inflation going forward. For example, even with the recent revaluation of the Chinese renminbi, the dollar has increased by 7½ percent against major currencies so far this year, which should take some of the pressure off of import prices. In addition, inflation expectations, which may affect wage and price setting, appear to be edging lower: We see this both in survey results and in the financial markets—through noticeable declines in “inflation compensation”, measured by the difference between the yields on Treasury bonds with and without inflation protection. A third factor is productivity growth. There have been concerns that a structural productivity slowdown was in the offing, which could put upward pressure on inflation; the good news is that structural productivity growth apparently still remains above the levels reached during the second half of the 1990s, although it may have edged down just a bit over the last few years.\n\nA final factor impacting the inflation outlook is the degree of slack in the labor market. Right now, the unemployment rate is relatively low: at 5 percent it’s near most estimates of the so-called natural rate. But other measures—such as the employment-population ratio, a survey of job market perceptions, and industrial capacity utilization—suggest that some slack still remains.\n\nRisks to economic growth and employment\nNow let me turn to the real side of the economy—growth and employment—and highlight some of the risks that affect my optimistic baseline projection. Even though overall growth has been respectable, economic activity has been burdened by some major drags over the past year or so. Three major ones result from the oil price shock, the deterioration of the trade balance, and a still relatively low level of business investment spending.\n\nAs I mentioned, the price of oil has just about doubled over the past two years. Typically, the markets view oil price jumps as temporary. But this time around, far-dated oil futures prices also have increased sharply, suggesting that the high prices may be here to stay. This is a highly unusual development. Most likely, it reflects the perception that there is little excess supply of oil available in the world and that global demand is likely to remain strong. The perception that the oil price shock is more permanent tends to intensify its negative effect on spending. Estimates suggest that the oil price shock has noticeably restrained real GDP growth—by about three quarters of a percentage point in 2005. This impact is certainly nontrivial. However, it is worth emphasizing that the recent price change and spending impacts are far smaller than those of the oil shocks in the 1970s.\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit, as we all know very well, has been growing rapidly for years. By the end of last year, it topped five and three-quarters percent of GDP, a new record. Two of the major factors contributing to the sizable imbalance between our imports and our exports are the strength of the U.S. economy relative to our major trading partners and the relative strength of the dollar. In 2004, the increase in the trade deficit—by itself—subtracted almost one percentage point from real GDP growth, representing a significant drag on overall activity.\n\nFinally, while business investment in equipment and software rose strongly last year, by almost 14 percent, the level of investment is still not as high relative to GDP as we’d expect, given favorable economic conditions and firms’ healthy balance sheets. Economic growth has been solid for a few years now. And, with the very low level of interest rates, borrowing costs can’t be the problem. Moreover, profit margins have been high for some time, so firms are certainly not strapped for cash. The shortfall might be due to business caution, perhaps related to reverberations from 9/11 and subsequent terrorist threats and actions or perhaps to the corporate governance scandals and the adjustments required by the legislation that followed them. Alternatively, the investment shortfall might reflect the perception by businesses that productivity gains can be realized at this stage that do not require major new investments in equipment and software.\n\nWhatever the explanation, the consequence of these drags is that the Fed had to keep interest rates exceptionally low for a long time just to get respectable, but not stellar, economic growth. In fact, the federal funds rate was lowered all the way to 1 percent and held there until the middle of last year. Since then, the FOMC has raised the funds rate nine times to 3¼ percent, but it still remains in a range normally considered stimulative.\n\nBond rate conundrum\nIncreases in the federal funds rate typically lead to increases in longer-term interest rates. But, as we all know, long-term rates have actually fallen as the FOMC has raised short-term rates. For example, the benchmark ten-year Treasury rate is down by more than ½ percentage point since the funds rate started heading up in the middle of last year. This is the basis for what Chairman Greenspan has called the bond rate “conundrum” that has commanded so much attention recently.\n\nThere is a debate about how to interpret the decline in longer term yields and it essentially boils down to whether the surprising behavior of long rates is due to various “special factors” operating independently of the current business cycle or instead augurs bad economic news on the horizon. If special factors are holding down long term yields, then the total amount of stimulus to spending from interest rates is currently greater than would be surmised on the basis of the current federal funds rate. In effect, unusually low long-term bond rates are now providing extra stimulus to offset the drags I described. A number of “special factors” might be at work to flatten the yield curve. One possibility is that low bond rates reflect a drop in risk premiums because inflation has become better anchored and the volatility of the real economy has fallen. But let me also note that other factors would seem to work in the opposite direction—for example, our large and growing federal budget and trade imbalances could be raising risk premiums.\n\nAnother possibility is that low long-term rates reflect unusually strong demand for long-term securities, for example, by pension funds seeking to improve the match between the durations of their assets and liabilities, by holders of mortgage-backed securities seeking to maintain the durations of their portfolios, or by foreign central banks that have been acquiring dollars. China may have been playing an especially large role, as its central bank has intervened in foreign exchange markets to peg the renminbi at a low level against the dollar. Of course, last week the People’s Bank of China announced that it had revalued the renminbi against the dollar by 2.1 percent, with the stated intention of managing the renminbi’s exchange value against an unspecified currency basket. This is not a large revaluation, but some observers think that it is the beginning of a much bigger move over time. If this is the case, we may gain a better understanding of the impact, if any, that Chinese exchange rate policy has had on U.S. bond rates.\n\nAn alternative to “special factors” as an explanation for the low level of long-term yields is the possibility that the flat yield curve reflects the market’s assessment that bad news is on the horizon. In other words, investors may expect only modest increases in the funds rate in the future because they think that the drags I’ve described will keep demand on the weak side for some time to come.\n\nWe probably won’t know the most important sources of this “conundrum” until more time passes, but the causes of the conundrum do matter to monetary policy. If the first class of explanations turns out to be correct, the federal funds rate probably needs to be somewhat higher than would otherwise be appropriate to offset the additional stimulus due to the flat yield curve. If the latter explanation fits the bill, and the market is correct that the drags going forward will be unusually strong, a somewhat easier policy may be appropriate.\n\nHousing\nWhatever the source of the conundrum, clearly low long-term rates have contributed to the continuing boom in the housing market. The share of residential investment in GDP is now at its highest level in decades. The question on everyone’s mind, of course, is whether this source of strength in the economy could reverse course and become instead a source of weakness. Put more bluntly: Is there a housing “bubble” that might collapse, and if so, what would that mean for the economy? To begin to answer this question, we need to know what we mean by the term “bubble.” A bubble does not just mean that prices are rising rapidly—it’s more complicated than that. Instead, a bubble means that the price of an asset—in this case, housing—is significantly higher than its fundamental value.\n\nOne common way of thinking about housing’s fundamental value is to consider the ratio of housing prices to rents. The price-to-rent ratio is equivalent to the price-to-dividend ratio for stocks. In the case of housing, rents reflect the flow of benefits obtained from housing assets—either the monetary return from rental property, or the value of living in owner-occupied housing. Historically, the ratio for the nation as a whole has had many ups and downs, but over time it has tended to return to its long-run average. Thus, when the price-to-rent ratio is high, housing prices tend to grow more slowly or fall for a time, and when the ratio is low, prices tend to rise more rapidly. I want to emphasize, though, that this is a loose relationship that can be counted on only for rough guidance rather than a precise reading.\n\nCurrently, the ratio for the country is higher than at any time since data became available in 1970—about 25 percent above its long-run average. Of course, the results vary widely from place to place. For Los Angeles and San Francisco, the price-to-rent ratio is about 40 percent higher than the normal level, while for Cleveland the ratio is very near its historical average.1\n\nCloser to home, the figure for Seattle is just over 35. For Portland, it turns out that the price-to-rent ratio is a bit anomalous. Unlike the ratio for the nation and many of the cities I’ve mentioned, Portland’s ratio has been trending up, and this pattern has been going on since the late 1980s. This means that there’s not a stable long-run average ratio to use as a comparison for today’s ratio, so the analysis we did for the other cities wouldn’t be that meaningful for Portland. What we do know is that the pace of home price appreciation in Portland has been close to the national pace over the past few years, lagging behind somewhat in 2003 as the state struggled to recover from the 2001 recession, but mostly catching up in 2004 and early 2005 as economic growth picked up noticeably in the state. As of early this year, home prices in the Portland area were up 12 percent over a year earlier, only a bit below the national pace of 12½ percent. More recently, I’ve heard reports that upscale homes in the Portland area are increasingly being sold at above-asking price—a phenomenon we’re all too familiar with in the Bay Area! So it’s clear that Portland’s housing market has been hot, but I’m sure that’s no surprise to you.\n\nIn any event, as I said before, the fact that the ratios for the nation and many areas of the country are higher than normal doesn’t necessarily prove that there’s a bubble. House prices could be high for some good reasons that affect their fundamental value. The most obvious reason is the low level of mortgage rates. This stems both from very stimulative monetary policy and from the conundrum I discussed earlier. Conventional mortgage rates have dropped from around 6 percent in early 2004 to around 5 percent recently.\n\nOther factors could also be raising housing’s fundamental value. For example, recent changes in tax laws may be having an effect. In 1998, tax rates on capital gains were lowered and the exemption from capital gains taxation for housing was raised to $500,000. Both of these changes would reduce the potential tax bite from selling one home and buying another. Another development, which may be making housing more like an investment vehicle, is that it’s now easier and cheaper to get at the equity—either through refinancing, which has become a less costly process, or through an equity line of credit. Both of these innovations in mortgage markets make the funds invested in houses more liquid.\n\nSo there are good reasons to think that fundamental factors have played a role in the unusually high price-to-rent ratio. But the bottom line here is fuzzy. It’s very hard to say how big a role these factors have played, so we don’t know how much remains unexplained. Frankly, even the best available estimates are imprecise, and they don’t definitively answer the question: Is there a bubble, and if there is, how large is it?\n\nGiven this uncertainty, my focus as a monetary policymaker is on trying to understand what kind of risks a drop in house prices would pose for the economy. One of the classic ways to do this is to ask “What if…?”—in other words, to pose a purely hypothetical question. In this case, the “what if” question might be, “What’s the likely effect if national house prices did fall by 25 percent, enough to bring the price-to-rent ratio back to its historical average?” Before going any further, I want to emphasize that I’m not making any predictions about house price movements, but instead, simply discussing how a prudent monetary policymaker could assess the risk.\n\nFirst, there would be an effect on consumers’ wealth. With housing wealth nearing $18 trillion today, such a drop in house prices would extinguish about $4½ trillion of household wealth—equal to about 38 percent of GDP. Standard estimates suggest that for each dollar of wealth lost, households tend to cut back on spending by around 3½ cents. This amounts to a decrease in consumer spending of about 1¼ percent of GDP. To get some perspective on how big the effect would be, it’s worth comparing it with the stock market decline that began in early 2000. In that episode, the extinction of wealth was much greater—stock market wealth fell by $8½ trillion from March 2000 to the end of 2002. This suggests that if house prices were to drop by 25 percent, the impact on the economy might be about half what it was when the stock market turned down a few years ago.\n\nMoreover, the spending pullback wouldn’t happen all of a sudden. Wealth effects—positive or negative—tend to affect spending with fairly long lags. So, a drop in house prices probably would lead to a gradual cutback in spending, giving the Fed time to respond by lowering short-term interest rates and keeping the economy steady.\n\nNow let’s complicate things. Suppose house prices started falling because bond and mortgage interest rates started rising as the conundrum was resolved, say, because the risk premium in bonds rose due to concerns about federal budget deficits or other factors. Then we’d have the cutback in spending because of the wealth effect, plus there’d likely be further spending cutbacks, as borrowing costs for households rose. Furthermore, a rise in long-term rates would have effects beyond just households—it also would dampen business investment in capital goods through a higher cost of capital.\n\nHow manageable would this scenario be? Like the wealth effect, these added interest-rate effects operate with a lag, so, again, there probably would be time for monetary policy to respond by lowering short-term interest rates. This obviously would not be a “slam dunk,” but in many circumstances it would seem manageable.\n\nA matter of more concern is whether this scenario would lead to financial disruptions that could cause spending to slow sharply and quickly. One issue that receives a lot of attention is the increasing use of potentially riskier types of loans, like variable rate and interest-only loans that may make borrowers and lenders vulnerable to a fall in house prices or increase in interest rates. I believe that the odds of widespread financial disruption on this count are fairly slim, although, clearly, some borrowers arevulnerable. First, the shift to these new instruments appears relatively modest overall. Second, the equity cushions available to both borrowers and lenders still seem, on average, to be pretty substantial. This is evident in looking at loan-to-value ratios, which have fallen, on average, as home valuations have risen faster than mortgage debt. In addition, most financial institutions enjoy comfortable capital positions, so they’re better able to weather any problems with their mortgage portfolios. Finally, some of the risk associated with mortgages has been transferred from banks to investors, as banks have sold off securitized bundles of mortgage debt. These investors may be in a better position to handle the associated risk. So, while there undoubtedly would be some fallout from a substantial drop in house prices, the financial system and consumers appear to be in reasonably good shape to handle the situation.\n\nMonetary policy\nI’d like to close my remarks by taking a step back from the home price story and putting it in the broader context of the economy’s overall performance—which, after all, is the chief concern of monetary policymakers. As I’ve emphasized, economic activity has been burdened by some major drags over the past several years. As a result, the Fed has had to keep interest rates exceptionally low for a long time just to get respectable economic growth. In fact, respectable growth is all we have gotten—even with exceptionally low long-term yields and unexpectedly rapid gains in house prices.\n\nThis growth has had to rest on the backs of just a few interest-sensitive sectors—business investment, consumer durables, and housing. From this perspective, it’s not all that surprising that housing markets have been hot. My point is that to offset the “drags” we’ve needed to give the economy a strong dose of stimulus—which inevitably boosted the housing sector.\n\nAs I’ve discussed, if a sizable reversal in house prices were to occur, it probably would affect the economy mainly through the lagged effects of declines in wealth and increases in interest rates, rather than through widespread financial disruptions. This would give monetary policy time to react to any resulting economic weakness by lowering interest rates. In addition, the magnitude of the potential house price overvaluation may be only around half that of the earlier stock market overvaluation.\n\nIn conclusion, policy still appears to be somewhat accommodative, and given the recent inflation performance and the dwindling of slack, it makes sense to continue the process of removing that accommodation.\n\nI hope I’ve provided you with some insight on the issues that I think are important to focus on as the Fed goes through this process. I look forward to taking your questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Erratum (posted November 7, 2005). The statement about the U.S. data beginning in 1970 is correct as it stands.

            "content": "It is a pleasure to take part in this conference. I thank the Bank of Japan for inviting me to share my views on incentive problems in monetary policy committees at central banks.\n\nI thought I would organize my remarks around two issues discussed in the paper by Fujiki (2005) and in the sessions—transparency and continuity—and do so in the context of two recent issues confronting the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC): (1) its recent decision to expedite the release of the minutes of its meetings; and (2) its recent discussion regarding the adoption of a numerical definition of price stability.\n\nOver the past decade, the FOMC has continually re-assessed the costs and benefits of various steps toward greater transparency and has made several significant increases in policy communication and openness. In February 1994, just months before I became a Federal Reserve Governor, the FOMC started to explicitly announce changes in the federal funds rate target. Later that year, the FOMC added descriptions of the state of the economy and the rationale for the policy action to the post-meeting press release. In January 2000, the FOMC introduced a statement describing the “balance of risks” to the outlook, and in March 2002 began releasing the votes of individual Committee members and the preferred policy choices of any dissenters. In August 2003, the Committee added explicit forward-looking language concerning future policy into its statement. Finally, in December 2004, it decided to release the minutes of its meetings with only a three-week delay. Previously, the minutes were made public with a five- to eight-week lag, just after the subsequent meeting and were, hence, less relevant to policy.\n\nThis decision to speed up the release of the minutes occurred several months after I returned to the FOMC table as President of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. I think it illustrates some of the important issues relating to transparency in monetary policy committees.\n\nIn considering whether to expedite the release of the minutes, potential costs were certainly recognized. Financial markets could misinterpret and overreact to the minutes. Greater emphasis on the minutes might also lead to less productive discussions at the meetings, because even speculative and off-the-cuff commentary would soon be out in the open and, hence, discouraged. On the benefit side, however, expedited release of the FOMC minutes provides more timely information to the public about the rationale for monetary policy actions and a more nuanced explanation of the reasons for the Committee’s decisions. Such a move toward greater transparency facilitates accountability, which is essential for unelected central bankers in a democratic society, and might make monetary policy more effective by helping to align financial market expectations with policy objectives.1\n\nOne impact of expedited release of the minutes is that it results in the earlier airing of differences of opinion among members. A more subtle issue is whether the exposure of such differences might affect the degree of collegiality in the Committee. This issue is important because, in my view, cooperation is critical to the FOMC’s success. My sense is that FOMC participants are highly motivated to cooperate in seeking, finding, and articulating a Committee consensus, and their ability to do so enhances the credibility, legitimacy, and likely effectiveness of monetary policy. In fact, I think FOMC members behave far less individualistically and strategically than assumed in some of the models summarized in Fujiki (2005). I do not find this terribly surprising. Sociologists find that in group situations, individuals are typically motivated to build on common ground to resolve differences of opinion and attain agreement.2 Without such a sense of group solidarity, a 19-member committee like the FOMC could find it so time-consuming as to be practically infeasible to craft even a short, post-meeting statement commanding majority agreement. Such sociological reasoning might also explain why FOMC dissents are so rare.\n\nThe jury is still out on whether the earlier exposure of differences of opinion will affect the sense of collegiality in the FOMC. Earlier release of the minutes affords greater flexibility for members to express their personal views publicly, for example, in speeches, without creating undue market confusion. My guess is that this will make it easier, not harder, to attain consensus, but time will tell.\n\nA second issue relating to communication and transparency that the FOMC discussed in February 2005 is whether to adopt an explicit, numerical price-related objective for monetary policy. The Committee decided to hold off for now, but I am sure that, along with other issues in monetary policy communication, this topic will be on the table again in the future.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Act gives the FOMC a dual mandate—to pursue maximum sustainable employment and price stability—but does not define either objective. My personal view is that the quantification of the long-run price-stability objective could offer several benefits. In terms of Committee operations, it could help to focus and clarify our own discussions. It could also help to anchor the public’s long-term inflation expectations from being pushed too far up or down. That is, a numerical long-run inflation objective may help avoid both destabilizing inflation scares and pernicious price deflations. Indeed, a credible inflation objective could enhance the flexibility of monetary policy to respond to the real effects of adverse shocks.\n\nAs with any move toward greater transparency, there are potential drawbacks. A main concern is the possibility that the enunciation of an inflation objective will be perceived as or result in a downweighting of the Committee’s maximum employment mandate. To guard against miscommunication, the nature of this objective would have to be very clearly stated as a long-run goal only, with the path for attaining it dependent on the implications for other Fed objectives, especially employment and financial stability.\n\nThe adoption of an inflation objective also raises issues related to the continuity of FOMC behavior. The price stability mandate is overarching because it is included in the Federal Reserve Act. But the interpretation of that mandate is left up to the Committee. Since one FOMC cannot bind future FOMCs, the potential for discontinuity could be large if individual views on the appropriate numerical objective were to change significantly over time or as a result of changes in the membership.\n\nWith respect to the likely stability of individual views over time, the evolution of my own thinking on this topic is perhaps instructive. When I was a Federal Reserve Governor, the FOMC discussed a numerical objective for inflation at its July 1996 meeting. At that meeting, there was some consensus among the participants, including myself, for a 2 percent long-run objective for consumer price index (CPI) inflation. From an economic standpoint, I believe the choice of an inflation objective should depend on an evaluation of the costs and benefits of very low inflation. Since then, there have been several important economic developments relevant to this choice. I argued in 1996 that the inflation objective should contain a cushion sufficient to grease the wheels of the labor market. The potential negative impact of downward nominal wage rigidity on real economic performance diminishes, however, with productivity growth, which raises average wage growth. As it turns out, high productivity growth in the U.S. during the past decade has made downward wage rigidity a non-issue, suggesting that a lower inflation buffer is sufficient. But, for me, this shift has been offset by the experience of very low inflation in the U.S. and deflation here in Japan, which has heightened my concern relating to the zero lower bound on the policy interest rate. Other relevant economic factors include the magnitude of the neutral real funds rate, the degree of macroeconomic volatility, and methodological changes affecting measurement biases.\n\nTaking all of these factors into account, I find myself still pretty comfortable with the numerical objective I had recommended almost a decade ago. More specifically, I would now favor a 1.5 percent numerical objective for inflation as measured using the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which, given the recent average differences in measurement bias, corresponds to a 2 percent objective for the core CPI. If the stability of my own views on the appropriate numerical inflation objective is representative, it seems likely that the FOMC’s numerical inflation objective would probably change fairly little over time due to economic factors.\n\nThe numerical inflation objective could also potentially evolve with changes in the membership of the FOMC, assuming some divergence in views among members. In fact, however, a number of Committee members have individually opined on this topic and the actual differences of opinion turn out to be rather small. I would characterize a long-run inflation objective centered on 1.5 percent for core PCE inflation as a “modal” view. Even if there were more significant differences of opinion, an advantage of a monetary policy committee is that a slow, continuous transition of new members is apt to produce greater continuity than might occur with a single central banker, where the replacement of the Governor could result in discrete policy shifts. In addition, the “sociological” considerations I discussed earlier, which foster cooperation and consensus, could encourage new members to support the goals endorsed by the prior committee. In practice, then, I think there would be ample continuity in the FOMC’s inflation target.\n\nContinuity is an especially important issue facing the FOMC now, as Chairman Greenspan’s term as a Federal Reserve Governor comes to an end. The Chairman changes infrequently—we have had only two in the past quarter-century. But one of the strengths of the FOMC is the broad experience of its members and staff. During the transition to a new Chairman, this should help ensure continuity.\n\nTo conclude, I would like to stress that there are no final answers, and that transparency and continuity are important issues which we face on the FOMC at almost every meeting.\n\n1.

            "content": "Our discussion today about the effectiveness of stabilization policies has been lively and informative. Importantly, the task of judging how effective stabilization policies are likely to be is complicated by the fact that we live in a changing world. Let me focus on one of the underlying forces for change: increased globalization. Thinking about increased globalization, by the way, is a relatively novel situation for the U.S. to find itself in, but is not so novel for the hosts and many others at this conference.\n\nIn my opinion, globalization is a net positive for the world economy. Increased flows of goods, services and capital across national borders generally enhance efficiency and should help individual economies become more flexible and resilient. But there are some costs as well; one that pertains to monetary policy is that globalization makes it harder to see what’s driving the economic events that we have to deal with. Let me give you two recent examples from the U.S. to illustrate what I mean.\n\nLong-term interest rates in the U.S. have actually fallen, despite the fact that the FOMC has tightened policy eight times over the past year. Several possible explanations of this have focused on global developments, such as increased purchases of government securities by Asian central banks and a worldwide excess supply of savings. But it is difficult to gauge the magnitude of these effects, and, as far as I am concerned, low long-term rates are still a “conundrum,” to borrow a term that Chairman Greenspan has used recently.\n\nThe relatively low levels of inflation that prevailed over the past decade provide another example of how increasing globalization may be changing the dynamics of the economy. Some have suggested that the Phillips curve has shifted, perhaps owing to the effects of increased globalization. Following a somewhat different logic, Ken Rogoff1 suggests a role for increased globalization in the nearly simultaneous decline in inflation across many countries.\n\nI could add more examples from the U.S. (such as puzzles relating to the current account deficit), just as I am sure you could from your own countries. The general point I want to make is that developments like increasing globalization and financial liberalization have changed, and continue to alter macroeconomic linkages, perhaps in fundamental ways. As a result, there is more uncertainty in the economy, and that’s an environment in which it is even harder for policymakers to determine the appropriate responses to economic events.\n\nWhat does this mean for monetary policy? We have heard Bob Rasche talk about the uncertainty faced by monetary policymakers and express doubts about the effectiveness of stabilization policy. He is not alone in expressing such doubts, of course, but is following a tradition that features Milton Friedman as one of its luminaries. Indeed, some economists take this position to an extreme, believing that uncertainty, both about the current and likely state of the economy and about the effects of monetary policy on the economy, is so overwhelming that policymakers should be humble and focus on only one thing: inflation—which is what the Fed can undeniably control in the long run. This approach is often referred to as “strict inflation targeting.”\n\nBut I, for one, am not a strict inflation targeter. I do not subscribe to the dismal conclusion of this approach. And—as far as policymakers go—I do not think I’m in the minority. Certainly, the Federal Reserve Act is more optimistic: as you well know, the Federal Reserve is charged with assuring both maximum employment and price stability. I do not mean to deny that there is a debate—both in academic circles and outside them—about how these objectives should be ranked relative to each other and about the ability of monetary policy to achieve them. But I have a hard time believing, for example, that the FOMC’s accommodative policy stance following the last recession has not helped support the subsequent recovery. I have discussed some of the issues in this debate in detail elsewhere;2 for now, let me just say that I think we can and should pay attention to both objectives. Furthermore, I would argue that the Fed has successfully done so over the past two decades. Indeed, these objectives are interconnected in important ways, as I will describe momentarily.\n\nI think the right approach to dealing with uncertainty is for policymakers to increase the clarity with which they convey to the public both monetary policy objectives and strategy. Monetary policy affects the economy not primarily through short rates, but instead through its effects on asset prices, including bond rates and equity prices. If financial markets have a good understanding of the central bank’s objectives and strategy, they will react appropriately to policy moves. This allows markets and policymakers to work together rather than at cross purposes—strengthening the transmission mechanism and shortening policy lags.\n\nOne important way to contribute to the public’s understanding of policy is for a central bank to act in a systematic manner in its response to changing economic conditions. Over time, market participants will observe the central bank’s reaction to news and will come to understand the determinants of policy. As a result, they will correctly anticipate policy responses to new information, in a way doing the work for the central bank.\n\nThis process can be accelerated through central bank communications that explain policymakers’ views on the economy and provide insights into the key determinants of monetary policy, especially during periods when policy may need to deviate from its usual pattern. In this I agree with what Marvin Goodfriend said about the benefits of enhanced transparency and communication in monetary policy.\n\nA look at the recent historical record shows that the FOMC has become more communicative of late. In 1994, it added descriptions of the state of the economy and the rationale for the policy action to the post-meeting press release. In January 2000, the FOMC introduced a statement describing the “balance of risks” to the outlook, and in March 2002, it began releasing the votes of individual Committee members and the preferred policy choices of any dissenters. In August 2003, the Committee added explicit forward-looking language concerning future policy into its statement. More recently, it decided to expedite the release of its minutes so that the minutes of each FOMC meeting are now issued three weeks after the meeting, providing the public with a more nuanced understanding of the various views within the Committee. I strongly believe that all of these measures to increase transparency have improved the effectiveness of policy.\n\nA natural next step for the FOMC is to contemplate providing even clearer guidance to markets by announcing an explicit numerical long-run inflation objective. Unlike many other central banks around the world, the FOMC does not have an explicit numerical inflation objective or range, though we have discussed this issue at FOMC meetings a number of times in the past, most recently in February.\n\nThese discussions have highlighted the significant benefits and costs associated with such a move. It would be helpful for the FOMC because it would facilitate both internal discussions and external communication. More importantly, it could help anchor the public’s expectations. One recent study has shown that an inflation target coupled with an increase in operational independence for the Bank of England has led to a reduction in the response of long term interest rates to shocks.3 This evidence implies that inflation expectations are better anchored now. It also makes me somewhat more optimistic about the value of an explicit numerical inflation objective than I would be if I were only to look at the evidence marshaled by Bob Rasche about the similarities of inflation rates across countries that do and do not announce such objectives. Of course, this is an area of active research and I realize that the jury is still out.\n\nOne important advantage of well-anchored inflation expectations is that it can give the central bank the freedom to react to other developments (such as an oil price shock, a recession, or financial market turbulence) without raising concerns about its commitment to price stability. Indeed, well anchored inflation expectations are likely to give the Fed greater freedom to accomplish the other part of its mandate: maximizing employment.\n\nRecent developments have highlighted another extremely important reason why well-anchored inflation expectations are important—they may help us avoid deflation. We have long known that inflation can be too high, but the recent experience of Japan has reminded us that inflation can be too low as well. We know from history that such an outcome can be extremely damaging to the economy.4 Perhaps the most unsettling aspect of the Japanese experience is the evidence on how difficult it can be to get out of a deflationary situation.\n\nThis is an important reason why the FOMC became so alarmed about the level and trajectory of U.S. inflation roughly two years ago. In statements issued over the May 2003 to October 2003 period, the FOMC referred to “…an unwelcome fall in inflation…” and worried about “…the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low…” Many people have interpreted these statements as signaling a lower bound for the amount of inflation the FOMC will accept. To the extent that this is true, articulating an explicit numerical long-run inflation objective might not appear to be a very big step.\n\nOf course, there are potential costs to such a move as well. One is the possibility of miscommunication regarding our dual objectives. In particular, one concern, which I share, is that some may misinterpret the enunciation of a long run inflation objective as a down-weighting of the Committee’s mandate to foster maximum employment. To reduce the risk of such an outcome, the announcement of any numerical inflation objective should be made in the context of clear and effective communication of the Fed’s multiple goals. Here, I am drawn to some specific language proposed by Governor Bernanke: “the FOMC regards this inflation rate as a long-run objective only and sets no fixed time frame for reaching it. In particular, in deciding how quickly to move toward the long-run inflation objective, the FOMC will always take into account the implications for near-term economic and financial stability.”5\n\nAnother concern is that the announcement of a numerical objective could lead to a change in the way policy is conducted, with excessive weight placed on the measurable goal—which is inflation—relative to the hard-to-measure ones such as full employment, thus leading to de facto strict inflation targeting. However, as I noted above, I believe the opposite, namely, that a credible inflation objective would actually allow the FOMC more room to focus on stabilizing output, because it would not have to worry about the adverse effect that its attempts to stabilize output might have on inflation expectations.\n\nOverall, while I am mindful of the potential costs of announcing an inflation objective, I conclude that the benefits outweigh the costs. Such a step could enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy not only for controlling inflation but also for stabilizing the economy.\n\n1. “Monetary Policy and Uncertainty: Adapting to a Changing Economy” Jackson Hole, WY, August 29, 2003.\n\n2. “Stabilization Policy: A Reconsideration,” (with George Akerlof), Presidential Address to the Western Economic Association, July 1, 2004, forthcoming in Economic Inquiry.\n\n3. “The Excess Sensitivity of Long-Term Interest Rates: Evidence and Implications for Macroeconomic Models” by Refet S.

            "content": "Thank you, John, for that kind introduction. I’m delighted to be with you today. As John said, I’m new to the San Francisco Fed. I’m still in my first year as President. But I’m not new to the Federal Reserve System. Nor am I completely new to banking issues. When I was a Governor at the Board some ten years ago, I served on the Committee on Markets and Regulation, where we focused on risk management and systemic risk, including supervising risk-taking at banks.\n\nThat period—the mid-1990s—was a fascinating time to work on banking issues. With the industry getting back on its feet after the dismal days of the early part of the decade, there was renewed energy for change. The legislative groundwork for Gramm-Leach-Bliley was being laid. Consolidation and expansion of interstate banking were moving ahead. Securitization was having a profound impact on the role of banks in funding credit. In derivatives markets, large banking organizations were both users and market makers.\n\nToday, ten years later, these trends are still changing banking. The challenge for the Fed and the other agencies has been to figure out the appropriate responses of bank supervision and capital regulation. For example, with banks competing in the broader financial services arena, it has been important in adapting supervision and regulation to limit the attendant burdens on banks. Indeed, when I was at the Board, one of the first things I learned—in a very graphic way—is just how heavily regulated the banking industry is. Here’s what happened. When I first joined the committee, I wanted to get up to speed on the issues, so I asked for a copy of the Fed’s regulations to review. What Iexpected was a couple of thick binders. What I got was something else altogether. Some poor research assistant came into my office rolling what looked like a grocery store shopping cart, and it was filled with volumes of regulations!\n\nNeedless to say, that image has stuck with me, and it has made me very supportive of efforts to reduce those regulatory burdens wherever feasible. At the same time, there are clear public policy concerns that justify bank supervision of risk and capital regulation. For example, even with all the changes in banking, the potential for moral hazard that’s related to the federal safety net for banks remains a concern. In addition, supervision addresses concerns about systemic risk—something that banks don’t fully factor into their own risk-management decisions. That’s why it makes sense for bank supervisors to have a role in ensuring that banks make careful and prudent decisions about the degree of risk they bear and hold capital commensurate with that degree of risk.\n\nIn my remarks today, I want to start by exploring a key construct underpinning the changes in supervision and regulation of risk that has helped make them less intrusive to the operations of banking. I’ll argue that the advances in risk management at banks and the changes in the supervision and regulation of banks have occurred through a mutually reinforcing process—where sometimes the private sector has taken the lead, and sometimes regulation and supervision have helped push risk management forward. Then I’ll turn to the impact of the economy on banking in recent years. I’ll conclude with some issues that are on our supervisory radar screen.\n\nSupervision, Regulation, and Risk Management in Banking\nThe idea that advances in risk management at banks and changes in capital regulation and risk supervision can be mutually reinforcing processes is not terribly surprising. Although banks and bank supervisors have different motives—which certainly can lead to differing views about what the appropriate level of risk is—they also have a common interest in having accurate measures of risk and in focusing on the processes and techniques for managing risk. For banks, good risk management is key to creating value for shareholders—that is, profits. For bank supervisors, good risk management and capital regulation are key to ensuring the safety and soundness of the banking system.\n\nA good example of how this common interest led to the mutually reinforcing process is the focus on capital as a fundamental part of risk management. In the early 1980s, bank supervisors had good reason to be concerned about banks’ declining capital positions. They took the initiative by instituting explicit capital requirements. Then came the first Basel Accord, which took effect in the early 1990s. It broke new ground by tying the level of capital to the riskiness of assets. Admittedly, this risk-based framework was crude, but it was a start. More importantly, though, Basel I was about increasing capital in banking and putting capital on the front line in risk management, both for supervisors and for banks.\n\nBasel I did succeed in increasing capital in banking. Today, ninety-seven percent of U.S. banks are considered not just adequately capitalized, but actually well capitalized, and the average risk-based total capital ratio sits at close to thirteen percent. Market capitalization ratios for many banking organizations are even more impressive.\n\nDespite this success in raising capital ratios, it was apparent early on that the first Basel Accord’s approach had flaws, especially for large, complex banking organizations. One serious concern was that some institutions were able to use securitization to reduce their funding requirements without commensurately reducing their risk. While the regulators were able to come up with ways to set capital requirements for such retained risk, it was a bit like writing software patches for an out-of-date operating system. By the mid-1990s, it was clear that we needed a new operating system.\n\nThe path to the new system, Basel II, provides another illustration of the mutually reinforcing process. This time, the innovations originated not with the supervisors, but with the bankers. They had developed models that encompass their processes, procedures, and techniques, including statistical models for assessing portfolio risk. Regulators saw that these “state of the art” risk-management tools also provided the makings of a framework that they themselves could use to address the shortfalls of Basel I. Clearly, leveraging the risk-management techniques banks were already using represented a significant intellectual step forward in bank supervision.\n\nI realize that when it comes to Basel II, some of you may be thinking, “Why should I care about that?” After all, in the United States, only about ten large, complex, internationally active banks will be required to use internal risk models to determine their capital requirements, and another ten or so may qualify to opt-in to do so. But even if you’re not among those 20 or so institutions, my answer still would be that, indeed, you should care and be knowledgeable about Basel II—perhaps not in terms of the detail, but in terms of the risk-management principles underlying the framework. The key principles are: striving to assess your overall portfolio risk and having confidence in the reliability of your risk assessment process.\n\nThe latter goal is actually one that supervision helped to push forward long before Basel II. Ten years ago, when I was at the Board of Governors, we rolled out our “risk-focused supervision.” Since then, although we still engage in so-called transactions testing, we have shifted our attention to assessing internal systems and controls for evaluating and managing risk. I think this approach has been effective and that it has helped promote better risk management in the banking industry.\n\nThe economy and banking\nAs I’ve described, risk management at banks and bank supervision were moving in the right direction in the second half of the 1990s. But the industry had yet to be tested by adverse economic shocks. Well, beginning in 2000, we started to get those shocks: the dot-com bust, the investment bust, then 9/11, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the corporate governance scandals. Not surprisingly, these shocks led to serious erosion in confidence and a pullback in spending by the business sector.\n\nBoth monetary policy and fiscal policy responded aggressively to these shocks. The Fed slashed short-term interest rates starting in 2001 to their lowest levels in forty years. And the Congress passed tax-cut packages to stimulate spending. But because these macro policies, especially monetary policy, affect the economy with a lag, we still had substantial job losses and clear signs of stress in the corporate sector. For example, bond downgrades and defaults rose sharply in the recession, matching levels reached in the previous recession. And risk spreads on high-risk corporate bonds spiked, exceeding previous peaks.\n\nIn the face of these shocks, both large banks and community banks proved to be far more resilient than in the previous recession. And it would appear that the developments I’ve been discussing—stronger capital positions in conjunction with improvements in supervision and banks’ advances in risk-management—deserve much of the credit for this resilience. For example, in terms of bank supervision, research indicates that supervisory ratings were stiffer for a given set of performance measures going into the last recession than they were earlier in the 1990s. This is consistent with the shift to risk-focused supervision that I mentioned earlier.\n\nIn terms of good management, it appears that, even where there were potential risk exposures, banks took relatively safe positions. That is illustrated in the experience with syndicated loans, where the data show increases in risk over the cycle, but with non-banks holding more of the riskier loans than banks. Prudence on the part of banks clearly came into play in other respects, as well. Federal Reserve surveys show that banks tightened credit standards and required that loans have lower loan-to-value ratios before the downturn, and our examiners have confirmed that during on-site reviews.\n\nBefore we pat ourselves on the back for such great supervision and such great management, let me point out that some things about the economic environment itself turned out to be favorable for the banking industry in this cycle. For one thing, banks were less exposed to the sectors under the most stress, such as telecommunications and energy. Probably the most significant favorable factor was the remarkable strength of consumer spending, especially on durables and housing, which was spurred in part by the low interest rate environment. This gave a boost to bank earnings through growth in lending, especially mortgage refinancing. Also, commercial real estate loan quality at banks held up relatively well, even with the rise in vacancies and declines in rents, in part because of the decline in mortgage rates and the rise in refinancing that lowered debt burdens for businesses.\n\nThe economic environment during the current cycle also affected the makeup of bank portfolios. With low interest rates and high profits in the recovery, nonfinancial businesses restructured their balance sheets. They moved to longer-term financing and also tapped internal funding. For large banks this meant a sharp decline in C&I loans and credit enhancements on commercial paper—though they have shared in the rise in bond underwriting. For community banks the restructuring meant a slowdown in C&I lending, though business loan growth was still positive.\n\nThe restructuring by businesses also reinforced the growth in commercial real estate lending at banks, including community banks. Here in the West, the share of commercial real estate loans for banks with under one billion dollars in assets exceeds the national average of twenty-eight percent in most states. Concentration is especially high in California, where commercial real estate loans account for forty-six percent of loans among community banks.\n\nAs you know, when residential mortgages are added, total real estate loans account for the lion’s share of the lending among community banks. The average share for the West as a whole is about the same as for the nation—at seventy percent—with Hawaii at the top with seventy-eight percent, followed by California with seventy-seven percent.\n\nThis emphasis on real estate financing by banks is understandable, given developments in credit markets. First, residential real estate debt relative to the economy has grown substantially. Even with securitization, it is not surprising that banks would share in the growth, especially given the decline in the role of savings institutions. Also, banks as intermediaries have a comparative advantage in funding more idiosyncratic credit, such as commercial real estate. The commercial real estate mortgage-backed securities market is growing, but not fast enough to absorb the overall rise in commercial real estate credit. The bottom line is that among community banks there is a notable degree of specialization and the trend has been toward more concentration.\n\nOutlook for the economy and banks \nThat brings me to the outlook. After the economic expansion stumbled in the spring of last year, it now looks to be on a firmer footing. A broad range of economic data suggests that real GDP is growing noticeably above trend. By most estimates, trend is around three and a quarter to three and a half percent. We’ve seen vigorous growth in business spending and solid growth in consumer spending. Employment hasn’t been quite as strong as expected, especially given all the monetary and fiscal stimulus out there. Even so, the economy generated an average of nearly 200,000 new jobs a month over the past twelve months.\n\nAs the economic expansion has firmed over the past few months, the Fed has removed some degree of accommodation, bringing the fed funds rate to two and a half percent. In its recent statements, the FOMC has indicated that the expansion seems likely to remain on track, with inflation pressures remaining well-contained. So long as this scenario holds up, the Committee has said that it expects to continue to remove the policy accommodation at a pace “that is likely to be measured.”\n\nAt banks, the renewal of strong growth in C&I lending in recent months is consistent with the rise in business investment. We will probably see business demand for credit rise further with the trimming of profit growth among nonfinancial firms. The repatriation of profits from abroad this year, however, could affect businesses’ demand for credit, at least at the larger banks. Nevertheless, in terms of the ability to borrow, business balance sheets overall look to be in good shape in terms of debt burdens.\n\nWhen it comes to households, we don’t know for sure what levels of debt burden they feel comfortable with. Although the Federal Reserve’s figures on financial obligations relative to income for households have come down some in recent quarters, they are still high. Nonetheless, the expectation is that consumer spending will continue to grow at a moderate pace.\n\nFor banks, an expanding economy should support loan growth and good asset quality. But there are some areas for caution in the banking outlook, and that brings me to what’s on our supervisory radar screen at the San Francisco Fed.\n\nSupervisory radar screen\nI already mentioned growing commercial real estate concentrations. That’s been prominent on our radar screen for some time because concentrations are especially high at western banks. Earlier this year, exam staff at the San Francisco Fed concluded a detailed review of some of the most highly concentrated banks that we supervise. They found that loan quality and underwriting is good overall, but concentration risk management practices are weak. For example, management and directors at most of these banks did not formally acknowledge their concentrations in their strategic or capital planning, nor did they have reports that give them a portfolio-wide view of their risk. The San Francisco Fed has communicated our expectations around high commercial real estate concentrations to the banks we supervise, and we’re now at the early stages of developing potential interagency guidance.\n\nGiven the high concentrations at banks in the west—and California in particular—we give considerable attention to commercial real estate market conditions. The good news is that we’ve seen a decline in office vacancy rates around most western markets since last year’s highs. But something we’re keeping an eye on is the lagged response in net operating revenues for commercial office and industrial space. This could lead to rising bank loan delinquencies and charge-offs. On the plus side, lower mortgage rates help ease cash flow pressures, and gains in employment should support higher rental rates going forward.\n\nAnother issue on our radar screen is rapid growth at many western community banks. For example, total loan growth at California commercial banks averaged twenty-two percent in the past year, excluding new banks. High growth can outstrip a bank’s capital and internal control structure, and we’ve seen banks offer new products and services without formally analyzing the risks and implementing required control and audit processes. Additional expansion in a stronger economy could add stress to the existing control environment and management capacity at some banks. Advances in technology and productivity certainly help support growth, but banks often tell us they’re “doing more with less,” and some may be tempted to cut corners imprudently. We’ve already seen this in some cases.\n\nAnother concern related to loan growth is the easing of credit standards and terms on loans. We expect to see this in an economic expansion, and recent Fed Surveys on bank lending confirm that this is occurring. But it’s somewhat troubling that one of the reasons banks indicated they’re easing credit conditions is increased competition from other banks and non-banks.\n\nThe rising interest rate environment is also on our radar screen. Even though banks have made considerable advances in managing interest rate risk, there are a few things we’re watching. First, some borrowers may have difficulty meeting higher payments on variable-rate loans—especially consumers who already have built up a high level of debt burden. That said, the potential impact on banks should be limited because nonperforming loans are at such a low level right now, and because of offsets from a stronger economy. A more significant supervisory concern with the rate environment is that while many banks are understandably positioning their balance sheets for rising rates—by shortening asset durations, for example—some are not considering alternative scenarios with respect to the shape of the yield curve and the timing of rate changes, and we’ve already seen how the bond market and long rates have fluctuated in reaction to some of the economic uncertainties I mentioned earlier.\n\nA related issue is the potential impact on liquidity. While deposit growth has held up reasonably well, funding may become more challenging as depositors seek higher returns. Banks have many more funding options available today than in the past. But rising rates will test banks’ interest rate risk management and funding strategies, especially if loan demand jumps concurrently. And though most banks—even small community banks—are using sophisticated techniques such as Economic Value of Equity and earnings simulation, some banks fall short by not fully understanding their models, by failing to validate assumptions on a regular basis, or by using a model that doesn’t support the size and complexity of operations.\n\nThe final issue I’d like to touch on is the compliance environment. As I said, I am sensitive to the regulatory burden, and I do appreciate the impact of heightened attention in several areas such as bank secrecy, anti-money laundering, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and various consumer regulations. Regulatory compliance—in a broad sense—is on our radar screen because we’ve seen some banks increase their focus on growth and efficiency so much that elements of their compliance programs slip. This has happened not only because the desire to reduce costs has made it tempting to cut corners, but also because some banks have not fully appreciated how growth in size and complexity requires a more robust compliance program.\n\nAs you know, the banking regulators have had a longstanding role in assessing compliance with various safety and soundness as well as consumer regulations. At the Federal Reserve, compliance is an essential component in our evaluation of a bank’s internal controls and risk management framework. Some recent laws have expanded the focus in certain areas—for example, the Patriot Act and SOX 404. But our fundamental role hasn’t changed. What has changed is the environment. Today, weaknesses in a banking organization’s internal control structure and compliance programs translate not only to significant operational risks but also to considerable legal and reputational risks.\n\nConclusion\nIn closing, I want to emphasize that we don’t think widespread problems are likely. Some banks will probably see fallout from the risks I mentioned as well as from others that I didn’t discuss. But industry conditions in many respects are stronger now than they’ve ever been. That undeniable fact, together with the advances in risk management I talked about, put the industry overall in a solid position to deal with any challenges that may arise.\n\n# # #"

            "content": "Good evening, and thanks for the warm welcome. I’m delighted to be here. I plan to give you my thoughts on the prospects for the U.S. economy and the implications for monetary policy. As always, my remarks reflect my own views, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve.\n\nLet me start with a little background. When I set off to Washington a decade ago to become a Fed Governor, a friend gave me William Greider’s The Secrets of the Templeto read. He thought it would be good preparation. As the title of the book suggests, the Fed was not considered an open, transparent or communicative institution. Indeed, most central banks for centuries had cultivated the image of being powerful and secretive.\n\nThe world has changed a lot since then. Several countries have now followed the lead of New Zealand which, in 1990, became the first country to adopt a strategy for conducting monetary policy known as inflation targeting. Inflation targeting is a highly transparent regime in which a central bank publicly specifies a numerical inflation objective—typically a range—and routinely issues reports detailing its performance in meeting that objective. The central bank must explain the reasons for any deviations that occur. New Zealand went so far as to specify that the Governor could be dismissed for failing to attain the target. The Bank of England not only has a numerical inflation target but also gives explicit probabilistic assessments of the odds of alternative outcomes via a series of so-called “fan charts.”\n\nPerhaps one day the Fed will adopt an explicit numerical inflation objective. It has not gone so far yet, but over the past decade, the Federal Open Market Committee has taken many steps to improve its communications with the public, the markets, and the press, and thereby its transparency.\n\nThe rationale for increased central bank transparency is highly practical—not simply ideological. The more people understand about the goals of monetary policy, and the Committee’s strategy to achieve them, the more effective policy can be. One reason is because people’s expectations about future policy actions have a strong influence on today’s longer-term interest rates and on financial conditions more generally—including the value of assets like equities and the dollar. And it is these broader financial conditions that influence people’s and firms’ economic decisions and plans. If the Fed’s only leverage were on the overnight federal funds rate governing lending of deposits between financial institutions, it would have little effect on the economy. Better communication both strengthens and speeds the impact of the Fed’s policy moves on the economy.\n\nImproved understanding of the Fed’s inflation objective can also serve to anchor inflationary expectations. That gives the Fed more latitude to respond to the adverse real economic impact of supply shocks, such as an increase in the price of imported oil—without touching off an expectations-led, destabilizing wage-price spiral. So, greater transparency can actually lead to better economic performance.\n\nI’ll give you some examples of the steps the Fed has taken toward greater transparency. During the Greenspan era it became standard practice for the Committee to release an explicit statement following the end of a meeting announcing its policy actions. Before that, Fed watchers had to infer policy changes from the Fed’s behavior in the open market.\n\nOver time, the amount of information in that statement has also gradually increased. For example, the Committee introduced language in 2000 describing its assessment of the balance of risks with respect to each of its objectives—price stability and growth. Then, in 2003, the statements included explicit discussions concerning likely future policy actions. This was a controversial step. It was taken because the Committee, probably for the first time since the Great Depression, became concerned about the risk of deflation and the fact that the federal funds rate, at 1 percent, was about as low as it can go. Beginning in August 2003, it sought to condition market expectations about future policy with the explicit statement that “policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.” This strategy likely served to hold down long-term interest rates and stimulate economic growth.\n\nThe most recent move toward increased transparency, which began at the end of last year, has been to speed up the release of the minutes so that they’re available beforethe next meeting, rather than shortly after it. This is significant because it gives the public more information in assessing the Fed’s next policy decision.\n\nThe minutes from the January meeting—released a week ago Wednesday— reiterated the views in the Committee’s statement after the meeting ended. It noted that, at present, inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remain well-contained, output appears to be growing at a moderate pace, and the risks to price stability and sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. As a result, policy accommodation most likely can be removed at a measured pace.\n\nBut there are some big differences between the statement and the minutes. For example, the minutes provide a wealth of information on the nuanced views of all 19 participants in the discussion—one sees the full range of opinions in gory detail, rather than just the consensus. In addition, the minutes for the January meeting contain a discussion of a longer-term topic the Committee considered—namely, the pros and cons of formulating an explicit numerical definition of the price stability objective of monetary policy. The pros were basically the ones I already noted—a numerical objective might anchor inflation expectations, help with communication about likely future policy actions, and also provide greater clarity for Committee deliberations. The cons were that it might appear to be inconsistent with the Fed’s dual mandate of fostering maximum sustainable employment as well as price stability and that it might constrain policy at times. It was a lively discussion that may be rejoined in the future. Although I have some sympathy with the con arguments, on balance, I generally favor increased transparency and think the benefits of establishing a numerical objective are likely to outweigh the costs.\n\nDoes this description entice you to want to read the minutes? Well, before you run out to download your own copy, let me be honest. The text will not rivet you with an action-packed, blow-by-blow account of clashing opinions. But it does lay out a range of issues—short-term, medium-term, and long-term—that the Committee is worried about. And that’s very fitting. After all, the classic description of Fed officials, and of central bankers generally, is that we’re people who are paid to worry about things.\n\nU.S. economic prospects \nWith that bit of background, let me turn explicitly to my personal views concerning the outlook for the U.S. economy—particularly the likely evolution of output, employment, and inflation. Then I’ll spend a little time going over some of the things that seem to me worth worrying about. Before I begin, I’d like to emphasize that my assessment of the outlook for the economy is quite consistent with the FOMC statement—that the risks to moderate growth and price stability are both balanced.\n\nFirst, I’ll briefly review where we are in terms of the real economy and inflation and how we got here. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, which is the semi-official arbiter of business cycle peaks and troughs, the U.S. economy has been expanding since November 2001. Last summer, however, there was widespread concern that the expansion might falter. Consumer spending, which has been the mainstay of this expansion, suddenly and substantially slowed. It seemed likely at the time that energy prices were a culprit. Energy prices had increased a lot, and that increase took a big bite out of consumers’ wallets. It had the potential to noticeably depress spending on a wide range of other goods and services. The hope was that the impact on spending would diminish over time and the growth rate of consumer spending would spring back.\n\nThat is exactly what has happened. Consumer spending, and the economy overall, have proven quite resilient. Investment spending by businesses has also picked up substantially. I now feel that we’ve seen enough positive signs to be reasonably confident that the expansion is self-sustaining. Over the past year, output has grown at just under 4 percent, noticeably above trend, which is estimated to be 3-1/4 to 3-1/2 percent. And recent data show strength in business investment in equipment and software, consumer spending, and housing.\n\nIn terms of the labor market, the expansion began as a jobless recovery, but the data on job creation have been consistently positive for most of last year. Taking the average over all of 2004, the economy gained 181,000 jobs per month. In January it added another 146,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate fell to 5.2 percent, reasonably close to common estimates of “full employment.” Other indicators, however, including the fraction of the population that is employed and measures of job vacancies suggest that quite a bit more slack remains than might be surmised from the unemployment rate. The record of job creation during the past year is by no means spectacular, but it’s good enough to suggest firming in the labor market and a gradual elimination of remaining slack. I would note that it takes a gain of about 125,000 to 140,000 jobs per month to match labor force growth, holding unemployment constant.\n\nNow, the outlook for inflation. The Committee tends to focus more on core inflation—that is inflation excluding volatile food and energy prices—and probably the best measure of it is the personal consumption expenditures, or “PCE” price index. This measure’s behavior over the last twelve months has been generally quite reasonable—around the value I would endorse as a numerical, long-run inflation objective if the Committee ever were to adopt one. It rose at 1-1/2 percent in 2004, up from just over 1 percent in 2003—a period in which the Committee was worried that inflation might drop to a dangerously low level. The uptick this year probably reflects in part the pass-through of higher prices for oil, commodities, and imports. Given that I think the economy will continue to grow modestly above trend and that inflation expectations will remain stable, my expectation is that inflation in 2005 will be much as it was in 2004. I’d consider this an excellent outcome, and I see the risks to it as roughly balanced.\n\nWorries\nBut, as I said, my job is be a worrier, so now let me turn to my list of worries—developments or potential developments that could have an impact on economic activity and inflation. My list won’t be exhaustive—I’ll keep it to just five items, which are not in any particular order of concern. They are: oil prices, the trade gap, the saving rate, productivity, and fiscal policy.\n\nWorry #1—oil prices. As I said, consumer spending has been remarkably resilient in the face of higher oil prices, but the evidence does suggest that there was some negative impact on spending over the past year and oil prices have again ratcheted up over $50 per barrel. In terms of inflation, we have seen some modest upward pressure coming from higher oil prices in the past year. The key question is whether this upward pressure on inflation will persist or intensify. The answer depends on at least two factors. One, obviously, is whether oil prices rise further. This is not what futures markets are forecasting, but it is a notoriously tricky thing to predict. The second is whether the effects on inflation today are changing people’s expectations about future inflation. As I indicated at the outset, if people begin to expect higher inflation because of the current impact of oil prices, we could face a kind of scaled down version of the devastating wage-price spiral we lived through in the 1970s. The good news is that evidence from financial market indicators, surveys, and recent patterns of labor compensation all indicate that long-term inflation expectations have been extremely stable. Presumably, this reflects the market’s view that the Fed will continue to demonstrate that it’s willing to do what’s necessary to ensure U.S. price stability.\n\nWorry #2—the trade gap. This has risen from near balance in the mid-1990s to a (nominal) deficit of almost $700 billion now. By reducing the need for domestic production of goods and services, the trade deficit subtracted about three quarters of a percentage point from real GDP growth in the first half of this year. Whether the trade gap will narrow depends—in part—on the strength of economic growth among our trading partners, because that affects demand for our exports. However, most of our major trading partners have had only moderate growth recently. So long as these conditions prevail, they won’t provide much impetus for growth in our own economy.\n\nOf course, prospects for the trade gap also depend on the prices of goods produced in the U.S. versus those produced abroad. It’s true that non-oil import prices have risen modestly over the past year, while the prices of U.S. exports have declined relative to foreign price levels. Such price shifts do tend to curb imports and boost exports over time. But they’re hardly enough to narrow the gap very quickly.\n\nWorry #3—the low saving rate. The personal saving rate has fallen over the past decade from about 7 percent to under half a percent in the third quarter of this year. One reason that consumers are saving so little out of disposable income is that their wealth has been on the rise; in the latter half of the 1990s, rising stock prices had a lot to do with the increase in wealth, but more recently, the main impetus has been house price appreciation. With interest rates rising now and housing prices unlikely to continuing advancing at their recent robust pace, consumers will need to curtail their spending to keep wealth growing in line with income. In other words, the saving rate might rise to more normal levels. If this happens, the falloff in spending growth by consumers could have a significant effect on overall economic activity.\n\nWorry #4—productivity growth. The concern here is that some recent developments hint at a slowdown in productivity growth. Slower productivity growth would have negative consequences for economic activity and would boost inflation because less rapid productivity growth translates into more rapid increases in firms’ production costs. One development hinting at slower productivity growth is the recent moderation in the pace of price declines for high-tech goods. This could imply that technological progress is slowing to some extent. Another is the productivity data themselves. Until recently, the productivity news was exceptionally good. Since the middle of the 1990s, the U.S. has been enjoying strong productivity growth. In the latter half of that decade, the pace of productivity growth was around 2-1/2%, a speedup of about 1% relative to the 1973-1990 period. It is now recognized that that speedup was a key reason why unemployment was able to drift so low without igniting inflationary pressures—quite the contrary, inflation fell. Beginning in 2001, productivity grew even faster—at an amazing 4% rate.\n\nThe very recent data have not been as good. In the last half of 2004, productivity growth slowed sharply—averaging less than 2 percent in the third and fourth quarters.1Though these numbers seem to confirm suspicions of a slowdown, I’d have to say I’m not convinced on several counts. One is simply that productivity data are very typically quite volatile, so you just can’t make that much out of the performance over a few quarters. Second, the concern is not whether productivity growth will remain at that amazing 4% rate—in fact, few economists would expect to see that. Rather, the issue is whether productivity growth will remain at the current estimate of its trend rate, which, according to several leading experts, is around 2-1/2%. If it does, that would be very good news indeed. It would support robust output growth and help keep inflation well-contained.\n\nMy view is fairly optimistic. I think there is some evidence that the economy is continuing to reap productivity gains from much of the investment firms and people already have made. These reasons are laid out in a growing literature on technology and productivity, much of which focuses on the significant lag that often exists between the time that firms invest in technological capital and the time they benefit from greater output and higher productivity. What takes time is the human element. People need time to learn how to get the most out of the technology they have. For example, one of our contacts at the Fed—a lawyer!—told us that his firm had recently discovered they could use search engines, rather than lawyers and paralegals, to look for incriminating evidence in emails. Beyond developing proficiency, people also need time to figure out how to reorganize their work processes to maximize the benefits of the technology they have. For example, Sam Walton argued that he benefited in the 1980s and 1990s from knowledge he had accumulated in the 1960s and 1970s, when he flew around the country visiting competing discount stores and attending IBM conferences. These anecdotes and analyses suggest to me that this learning and reorganization is still ongoing and is likely to play out for a good while, providing a continuing boost to productivity growth.\n\nWorry #5—fiscal policy. Fiscal policy has been very stimulative in recent years—we’ve had two large tax cut packages and an increase in spending on defense, Iraq, Afghanistan, and homeland security. In principle, it is appropriate for fiscal policy to stimulate demand during a recession, when private sector spending is sluggish. However, the policy went well beyond these desirable countercyclical effects. The tax cuts have mushroomed the deficit for the long term at a time when the baby-boomers are becoming golden-agers and when the costs of retirement programs are set to soar. In fact, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are projected to rise dramatically as fractions of GDP over the next several decades. Currently projected budget deficits are unsustainable and will ensure a low level of national saving. Conventional economic analysis suggest that this situation is likely to raise long-term interest rates, crowd-out business capital investment, depress productivity growth, and exacerbate the current account deficit.\n\nMonetary Policy\nI’ll conclude with just a few thoughts on monetary policy. To assess the stance of monetary policy, economists commonly compare the inflation-adjusted level of the federal funds rate to a benchmark rate called “neutral.” The neutral real federal funds rate is defined as the rate that would be consistent with full employment of the economy’s labor and capital resources over the medium term. Efforts to quantify this rate, via statistical techniques or model-based simulations, take into account factors such as productivity growth in the economy, the stance of the fiscal policy, and the magnitude of the trade deficit that conceptually affect this neutral rate. Because these factors vary over time, the neutral rate also tends to change over time. In addition, I should emphasize that estimates of the neutral rate are highly uncertain. That said, reasonable estimates place the neutral real federal funds rate in the range of 1.5 to 3.5%. With inflation now in the vicinity of 1.5%, the associated value of the nominal federal funds rate corresponding to “neutral” ranges from 3 to 5 percent.\n\nJudged from the perspective of a neutral policy stance, monetary policy at present is accommodative. At 2 ½ percent in nominal terms (about 1% in real terms), the federal funds rate remains below the lower bound of the estimated neutral range. An accommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate when there is excess slack in the labor market—the current situation—or when inflation is below desirable levels. In my judgment, inflation is now at a level consistent with price stability. With slack in the economy diminishing, the degree of monetary accommodation also needs to diminish over time, toward neutral, for inflation to remain well contained. The Committee has stated for some time that, with underlying inflation remaining low, policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. In fact, we have raised the rate by 25 basis points at each of the last six meetings. However, it should be obvious that the closer the actual rate gets to the neutral range, the more carefully the Committee will need to consider each successive increase. In other words, the pace of removing policy accommodation must, in reality, depend on how economic activity and inflation actually develop. Moreover, these developments themselves could affect the Committee’s judgment concerning the momentum in aggregate demand or supply and thus the real federal funds rate corresponding to a neutral policy stance.\n\nIf the pace of economic activity accelerates and labor market slack erodes more quickly than expected—or if some of the upside risks to inflation materialize—it would probably be appropriate to remove accommodation more rapidly. If, alternatively, the expansion falters or we experience some of the downside inflation risks, there are likely to be more opportunities for the Committee to pause. Policymakers could be confronted with more difficult choices if output growth and inflation move in opposite directions. Naturally, risks to both growth and inflation abound. Nevertheless, I would reiterate that at present, the economy appears to be well positioned for healthy economic growth with stable inflation going forward. The upside and downside risks to both objectives appear to be roughly balanced.\n\n# # #\n\nEndnote\n\n1. The official numbers show average growth of 1.3 percent. However, with fourth quarter real GDP having been revised up from 3.1 to 3.8 percent, it appears likely that the fourth quarter productivity number will be revised up as well."

            "content": "It’s a pleasure to join you today. I was very pleased when John Shoven asked me to share the dais with John Lipsky to give my views on the U.S. economic outlook and the implications for monetary policy. Let me note that, as always, I am speaking for myself and my comments do not necessarily reflect the opinions of other Fed policymakers.\n\nI appreciate hearing John’s views on the real side of the economy. In general, I’m in agreement with him. Over the past year, output growth averaged three and three-quarters percent, modestly above trend, which, by most estimates, is around three and a quarter to three and a half percent. I believe that we have now seen enough positive signs in the economy to have some confidence that it is on course for sustained growth, being supported by accommodative financial conditions and robust productivity growth.\n\nIn terms of the labor market, the data have been consistently positive for several quarters. Taking the average over all of 2004, the economy gained 181,000 jobs per month and in January it added another 146,000 jobs. This performance is by no means spectacular, but it is sufficient to conclude that the labor market is gradually firming up. In January, the unemployment rate fell to 5.2 percent, suggesting that at least a bit of slack still remains.\n\nAs a Fed policymaker, of course, I’m committed to the dual goals of maximum employment and price stability. Like my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee, my expectation is that inflation will remain well contained, assuming that the economy continues to grow at a pace that is modestly above trend so that any remaining labor market slack is gradually eliminated.\n\nThere are a number of risks to this outlook for inflation over the next year or so, but overall, they appear to be essentially balanced. One risk is that there is a good deal of uncertainty about the actual extent of slack that remains in the labor market. Another relates to the possibility of further movements of important relative prices—especially the price of oil and the foreign exchange value of the dollar. A third risk is that firms’ markups of prices over unit labor costs, which are now exceptionally high, could revert to more normal levels. This could result in a significant reduction in the rate of inflation.\n\nProductivity Growth and Inflation\nThe final risk factor, and the one I’d like to focus on in my remarks today, concerns the pace of labor productivity growth going forward. Productivity growth, of course, matters not just to inflation but also to the long-run prospects for the U.S. economy. I might add that issues relating to productivity are of particular interest to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. As some of you know, a couple of years ago we established the Center for the Study of Innovation and Productivity at the Bank to explore these very topics.\n\nSeveral recent developments have raised concerns about a productivity slowdown that could slow economic growth and boost inflation. For example, during the latter half of 2004, the nation’s productivity growth came in noticeably below the astounding rate of nearly four and a half percent in the prior two and half years. In the third quarter, non-farm productivity growth slowed to around one and three-quarters percent, and in the fourth quarter to only eight-tenths of a percent. Moreover, during the last year, quality-adjusted computer prices haven’t been falling as fast as they have for the past decade. That may signal some slowing of technological innovation in this sector. In addition, there is some industry opinion that the pace of software development is beginning to slow.\n\nThese developments give us ample reason to think seriously about what the future may hold for productivity growth. But it is also important to put them into perspective. For one thing, productivity growth rates are extremely volatile over periods as short a few quarters, so we shouldn’t make too much of the very recent data. More importantly, I want to emphasize that few economists expect the economy to continue to deliver the very fast productivity growth rates we saw in both 2002 and 2003 and in the first half of 2004. Rather, there’s some consensus among economists that the trend growth rate of U.S. productivity, since the productivity surge began in 1995, is around two and a half percent. That is still a very high number—nearly double what it had been during the quarter century before 1995—with the potential to enhance living standards dramatically in this country if it is maintained in the decades ahead. The real issue from the standpoint of inflation is whether recent developments portend a slowdown in the trendrate of productivity growth below a rate of roughly two and a half percent.\n\nWhy would a slowdown below two and a half percent likely boost inflation? In theory, there are two counteracting effects. First, a slowdown in the trend rate of productivity growth is likely to raise business costs for a time, because firms would face more rapid growth of unit labor costs. To offset the resulting squeeze on their profit margins, they would need to raise prices more rapidly. Eventually, increases in unit labor costs are likely to fall back toward previous slower rates as workers are forced to accept lower wage growth to compensate for their slower productivity growth. But during the adjustment period—which can last for a considerable period of time—there is upward pressure on inflation. Of course, by the same token, a rise in the trend growth rate of productivity could lead to downward pressure on inflation for a time.\n\nA slowdown in trend productivity growth would have a second effect which might offset some of the upward pressure on inflation. A productivity slowdown would likely result in slower growth in aggregate demand. Growth in consumer spending would probably weaken as lower business profits limit stock market gains, thereby reducing household wealth. More foresighted consumers might also reduce spending, perceiving that the prospects for growth in real wages are not as bright. Further, lower expected rates of productivity growth should restrain business investment by reducing the prospective return to capital.\n\nThe net impact of the two opposing effects of productivity growth on inflation is an empirical issue. My reading of the evidence suggests that the predominant medium-term effect of a slowdown in productivity growth would likely be higher inflation.1 This would seem to be the counterpart to the reductions in inflation that occurred over the past decade, when rapid productivity growth aided the Fed in bringing inflation toward price stability.\n\nSo a key issue for inflation going forward is whether the trend growth rate of productivity will remain near its estimated rate of around 2 ½ percent. If so, core inflation seems likely to remain stable, near its current moderate pace. If productivity accelerates or decelerates, we could see inflation start to fall or rise relative to the 1-1/2 to 2 percent rate that prevails today. My own view is that the risks surrounding the outlook for productivity are roughly balanced.\n\nProspects for productivity\nTo explain why I hold this view, let me start with a brief look at what the sources of productivity growth have been since the surge began in the mid-1990s. There are three basic factors to consider. The first is capital investment—in particular, the pace at which the quantity of capital per worker rises over time. The second is improved labor quality, or human capital—that is, a better educated or more skilled work force. The third factor is called “multifactor productivity,” which I will refer to as MFP for short. As you can tell by its eloquence, this is a term coined by economists. It essentially stands for all the gains in productivity that are not accounted for by either increased capital investment or improved labor quality. It is thought to capture, more or less, the productivity gains that ultimately stem from innovation. For example, it would include the engineering and scientific knowledge that goes into new technology. It also would include improved management processes, such as ”just-in-time” inventory management, as well as “creative destruction,” whereby innovative firms expand market share at the expense of less innovative firms.\n\nEconomists at the Federal Reserve Board analyzed U.S. labor productivity, looking at the period from 1996 to 2001, when productivity rose to nearly two and a half percent a year, as well as the period from 2002-2004, when labor productivity rose at an annual rate of almost four and a quarter percent.2 They found that the initial mid-1990s acceleration in labor productivity reflected in about equal parts an increased contribution of capital investment and an increase in MFP, with little, if any, change in the contribution from worker skill improvements. But the results for the period from 2002 to 2004 were noticeably different. This period, of course, was the worst of the “investment bust,” when business investment actually receded. The study’s results suggest that, over those years, a further acceleration in MFP accounted for more than all of the acceleration in labor productivity.\n\nHow do we explain the most recent speedup in the pace of labor productivity and MFP growth? One possible answer is that the increase is more apparent than real, and that it soon will be reversed. This argument relies on a link between shaky business confidence and weak hiring. It’s understandable that the investment bust in the last recession, the tragedy of 9/11, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the corporate governance scandals could have eroded business confidence. And that may have made firms reluctant to take on the long-run commitment of adding workers. This hesitancy could then lead to strong labor productivity growth to the extent that firms have been pushing their existing workers particularly hard and requiring them to put in extraordinary effort. This extraordinary, unobserved effort would raise measured labor productivity and MFP. Presumably, if this story were correct, then when firms regain confidence, they’ll be willing to start hiring again, and the pace of productivity growth will decline.\n\nFrankly, I have my doubts that an unusual degree of worker effort explains much of the strong productivity performance we’ve seen in the past few years. First, if firms were boosting their productivity by making their existing employees work harder, you would also expect that they were requiring them to work longer hours.3 But the admittedly limited data we have—which covers only production and non-supervisory workers—don’t show that. Rather, they show that hours per worker have been declining since the late 1990s.\n\nSecond, there have been considerable differences across states in labor market performance since 2001, with some states expanding employment and others contracting. If this story linked to unwillingness to hire were quantitatively important, then you might expect to see less productivity growth in states where employment grew more rapidly than in states where employment growth was weak. But an analysis of the data by staff at the San Francisco Fed does not show that. Instead, for the most recent period, it finds essentially no relationship across states between employment (or output) growth and productivity performance.4\n\nSo, what if we accept that much of the productivity speedup is real—and not merely a mismeasurement of labor effort? What might explain the pickup in labor productivity growth over the past few years? Some recent studies suggest that the answer lies in information technology, where the pace of technological innovation is clearly quite rapid. But its role in the last few years is different from its role in the late 1990s. In that period, studies tend to find that MFP gains in the production of information technology contributed substantially to the overall pickup.5 In addition, firms invested heavily in new (and steadily cheaper) information technology, boosting capital investment in industries that used IT intensively.\n\nBut for the more recent period, studies tend to find that the MFP acceleration is more broad-based across industries that use technology—not confined to the IT-producing sector. For example, the results I cited earlier from Federal Reserve Board economists suggest that the MFP acceleration since 2002 is entirely accounted for (in fact, more than accounted for) by an acceleration in MFP in sectors that use information technology. Sectors that produce information technology, especially semiconductors, have actually contributed somewhat less to MFP growth in the 2000s relative to the late 1990s.6\n\nA mechanism that may explain the continued rise in MFP in sectors that use technology is that firms are learning new and better ways to use technology they already have in place to become more productive. Indeed, some evidence suggests that the extraordinarily high rates of investment in high-tech equipment during the second half of the 1990s actually led to a reduction in measured productivity growth over that period. The reason is that firms had to devote a lot of human capital and time to learning how to get the most out of it; that is, resources were diverted from current production to installing the new capital and learning how to use it. If firms continue to increase their proficiency in using the technology they already have, this could help keep productivity growing at a robust pace. For example, one of our contacts told us that his law firm had recently discovered they could use computer search facilities effectively to look for incriminating evidence in email files; that meant less labor on the project and therefore reduced legal expenses.\n\nSecond, a fundamental way that information technology enhances productivity is by allowing firms to reorganize work-place processes. For example, major banks report that, through ongoing use of technology, they have been able to support growth in customers and services with fewer staff. A further example is the continuing expansion of Wal-Mart and other “big-box” stores, a trend that has had a dramatic effect on productivity growth in the retail and wholesale sectors. This process of using information technology to reorganize work processes, of course, takes time. Sam Walton, for example, argued that he benefited in the 1980s and 1990s from knowledge he had accumulated in the 1960s and 1970s, when he flew around the country visiting competing discount stores and attending IBM conferences.7\n\nMore formally, the growing academic literature on information technology as a “general purpose technology”—a technology that has broad applicability across the economy—suggests that to reap its benefits, firms have to make substantial complementary investments in learning, reorganization, and the like. Hence, the payoff in terms of measured output may be long delayed.8 For example, one study finds that in a sample of 527 large U.S. firms from 1987 to 1994, the benefits of computers for output and productivity rise over time and are not fully realized for at least five to seven years.9 The authors interpret their results as suggesting the importance of combining computer investments with “large and time-consuming investments in complementary inputs, such as organizational capital.” Another study finds that industries that had high growth rates of information and communications technology capital in the 1980s or early 1990s tended to have faster MFP growth rates in the late 1990s, consistent with the notion that firms were undertaking unobserved investments in organizational capital, which then paid off in terms of measured output and productivity with a long lag.10 More generally, innovations in information technology appear to have caused ripples of co-invention and co-investment in other sectors, such as retail trade.11\n\nIn addition, the general purpose technology literature suggests that the benefits of information technology used by one firm often “spill over” to other firms, which again imparts a lag to the process. For example, successful new managerial ideas—such as those implemented in retail trade—seem likely to diffuse to other firms. Imitation is often easier and less costly than the initial co-invention of, say, a new organizational change, because you learn by watching and analyzing the experimentation, the successes and, importantly, the mistakes of others.12\n\nWhat does this analysis suggest that we should expect going forward? I’m reasonably optimistic. It seems unlikely that the business learning and reorganization that we’ve been hearing about and that the academic literature emphasizes has suddenly disappeared. My sense is that businesses are still learning what new technologies can do for them.\n\nAs I noted earlier, several leading economists suggest that a reasonable estimate for trend productivity growth going forward is about 2-1/2 percent per year.13 This is close to the rate of productivity growth that we saw from 1995 to 2001. And although it would represent a slowing of the outsized, and unsustainable, gains we’ve seen since then, it appears fast enough to maintain the favorable inflation results we’ve had in recent years. Forecasting is, of course, always uncertain and difficult. But it seems to me that the risks to this expectation are reasonably well balanced.\n\nMonetary Policy\nI’ll conclude with just a few thoughts on monetary policy. We know that with the federal funds rate at 2-1/2 percent—only about 1 percent or a bit less above the inflation rate—the current policy stance remains accommodative. Over time, the degree of accommodation will have to diminish, with policy reverting toward so-called “neutral” for inflation to remain well contained. It’s uncertain exactly what the neutral range is, but a common estimate is 3-5 percent. The Committee has stated for some time that, with underlying inflation remaining low, policy accommodation can be removed at a pace which is likely to be measured. In fact, we have raised the rate by 25 basis points at each of the last six meetings. However, it should be obvious that the closer the actual rate gets to the neutral range, the more carefully we will need to consider each successive increase. In other words, the pace of removing policy accommodation must, in reality, depend on how economic activity and inflation actually develop. Moreover, these developments themselves could affect the Committee’s judgment concerning the momentum in aggregate demand or supply and thus the real federal funds rate corresponding to a neutral policy stance.\n\nIf the pace of economic activity accelerates and labor market slack erodes more quickly than expected—or if some of the upside risks to inflation materialize—it would probably be appropriate to remove accommodation more rapidly. If, alternatively, the expansion falters or we experience some of the downside inflation risks, there are likely to be more opportunities for the Committee to pause. Of course, we could be confronted with more difficult choices if output growth and inflation moved in opposite directions. In any event, risks to both growth and inflation abound. However, I agree with the Committee’s judgment, reiterated in its statement last week, that the upside and downside risks are currently balanced.\n\n# # #\n\nEndnotes\n\n1.

            "content": "Thanks for that very kind introduction. It’s a pleasure to meet with you today. As Leslie said, I served as a monetary policymaker once before—back in the mid-1990s, when I was a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Washington, D.C. Since then, of course, there have been some important developments and advances in the conduct of monetary policy.\n\nOne that began while I was at the Board involved communication. The Federal Open Market Committee took some significant steps toward improving the way it conveys its messages to the markets, the press, and the public. An important impetus was the conviction that the more people understand about the goals of monetary policy and how the Committee is trying to achieve them, the more effective policy can be. The reason is that it’s not just today’s level of the federal funds rate that matters for the way people make decisions in the marketplace. What also matters are people’s expectations about future policy actions. That’s because those expectations have a strong influence on today’s longer-term interest rates and financial conditions more generally and therefore on the economic decisions and plans of households and businesses.\n\nIn the years since I was at the Board, the Committee has worked to improve their communications to help shape those expectations. One way, of course, is through speeches like this one. But an important institutional step was developing the press statement that is now released at the close of each policy meeting of the FOMC. It has evolved to explain the Committee’s outlook for the economy and inflation and how it perceives the balance of risks to those outlooks.\n\nThe Committee took another significant step in its communications efforts at its last meeting on December 14. It voted to speed up the release of the minutes of the meetings. Now, the minutes come out three weeks after each meeting and therefore before the next meeting, rather than a day or two after it. This, of course, makes the information in the minutes more useful in assessing the Fed’s next policy decision. The new schedule was announced in the same press statement that announced the quarter point increase in the fed funds rate. One reporter—who’s well known for his coverage of the Fed—said this: “The most important step Federal Reserve officials took was not raising their target for the overnight lending rate by a quarter point. It was the decision to release the minutes of each FOMC meeting three weeks after it occurs.” For those of you who have never read the minutes, they summarize the discussions among all nineteen people at the meeting—so naturally you get to see the variety of viewpoints the participants hold.\n\nAs many of you know, when the minutes were released on January 4, there was a lot of focus on the paragraphs that described some risks that could lead to higher inflation. But if you read through the document, you’ll find that it also contains a discussion of factors that may put downward pressure on inflation. Indeed, at several points, the minutes say that the Committee felt that inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remain well-contained and the risks to price stability are roughly equal. In fact, those are the very words the Committee members agreed to use in the official press statement.\n\nMy own view is consistent with that statement—I do think the inflation risks are fairly well balanced. I agree that there are forces that could cause inflation to rise. But since the reaction to the minutes focused so much on those forces, I thought I’d use this occasion as a chance to give “equal time” to the other side—the counterbalancing forces that can hold inflation in check. As always, these remarks reflect my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve.\n\nBefore discussing inflation, however, let me start with a brief description of my views on the real side of the economy—that is, on output and employment.\n\nThe real side of the economy\nThe good news is that we’ve now seen enough positive signs in the economy to have some confidence that it is on course for self-sustaining growth. Over the past year and a half, output growth averaged four and a half percent, solidly above trend, which, by most estimates, is around three and a quarter to three and a half percent. In particular, recent data show strength in manufacturing output and consumer spending.\n\nIn terms of the labor market, the data have finally become more consistently positive, especially since mid-year. Taking the average over all of 2004, the economy gained about 185,000 jobs per month. Though this is not a fantastic performance, it is sufficient to suggest that the labor market finally is firming up enough to gradually eliminate the resource slack that remains. And that’s certainly something many people have been eagerly waiting for.\n\nAlthough this overall performance is pretty good, I think it’s important to qualify it a bit by noting what the context is: In order to get this performance, monetary policy has had to be extremely accommodative—and for a very long time. Indeed, the economy has been getting a push not only from substantial monetary stimulus, but also from substantial fiscal stimulus, including several tax cut packages and increased spending on defense and homeland security.\n\nSo, one might ask, given all this stimulus, why isn’t the economy doing even better? What’s holding it back? I can think of a few factors, some of which will come up again when I discuss inflation.\n\nOne is the oil price shock. Although consumer spending has been remarkably resilient in the face of this shock, the evidence does suggest that there was some negative impact on spending over the past year.\n\nAnother factor involves the large and growing trade gap. By reducing the need for domestic production of goods and services, the trade deficit subtracted more than half a percentage point from real GDP growth over the past year. Whether the trade gap will narrow depends—in part—on the strength of economic growth among our trading partners, because that affects demand for our exports. However, most of our major trading partners have had only moderate growth recently. It is true that non-oil import prices have risen modestly over the past year, while the prices of U.S. exports have declined relative to foreign price levels. Such price shifts do tend to curb imports and boost exports over time. But they are hardly enough to stem the tide of rising imports into this country or to stimulate our own exports very much in the face of only moderate growth abroad.\n\nGoing forward, a couple of factors that could take some steam out of the expansion are related to fiscal policy and business investment. While fiscal policy stimulated the economy over the last couple of years, with tax cuts and spending increases, this year most estimates indicate that it is likely to become roughly neutral, if current plans remain in place. In terms of business investment, the good news is that it has finally rebounded, reaching a double-digit rate for the past three quarters. But there are hints of a possibility that business investment in high-tech could slow down. At this point, the data are too recent to be conclusive, but they are suggestive. In the third quarter, the growth rate in businesses’ real investment in high-tech fell to just over eight percent—far below what it was over the prior four quarters. And since the middle of last year, growth in high-tech manufacturing production slowed noticeably. Another hint comes from the recent slide in the stock prices of some major high-tech firms; insofar as stock prices are good predictors, this suggests a more subdued outlook. Moreover, during the last year, quality-adjusted computer prices haven’t been falling as fast, and that may signal some slowing of technological innovation in this sector. Finally, there is some industry opinion that the pace of software development is beginning to slow.\n\nAlthough I’ve spent a fair bit of time discussing several current and potential drags on the economy, I want to emphasize that, overall, my view is positive. I think the data are pretty convincing that the economy is on course for sustainable growth, probably modestly above trend, for this year.\n\nBalanced risks to inflation\nNow let me turn to inflation, where we have two main measures of consumer prices to consider. One is the consumer price index, the CPI—in particular, the core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices. Over the last twelve months, inflation in this measure has come in at a relatively moderate two and a quarter percent. This is up noticeably from 2003, in part reflecting some pass-through of higher oil prices into core prices as well as increases in both commodity and import prices. The other measure of core consumer inflation, which is based on the personal consumption expenditures index, gives a somewhat more reassuring picture. Inflation according to the core PCE has been more modest, averaging only one and a half percent over the past year and just one and a quarter percent over the past three months. So, overall, recent data show core consumer inflation behaving reasonably well.\n\nMy expectation is that inflation will remain well contained, assuming that the economy grows at a pace which is modestly above trend. There are risks to this forecast but, as I said, I consider them fairly well balanced, not asymmetric. To explain my view, I would like to rely on the so-called Phillips Curve framework, which is conventionally used by economists to forecast inflation. The framework suggests that five main factors influence inflation. These are (1) the extent of slack in the labor market, (2) the public’s expectations of future inflation, (3) the extent to which businesses mark up their costs in setting prices, (4) movements in important relative prices, especially the price of oil and the foreign exchange value of the dollar, and (5) productivity growth.\n\nI’ll start with labor market slack, which matters for inflation to the extent that it affects the pace of compensation growth. The unemployment rate currently stands at just under five and a half percent. Most economists would agree that some slack remains in labor markets which should be putting downward pressure on labor cost increases and inflation. With the unemployment rate likely to fall gradually toward full employment over the next couple of years, the extent of this downward pressure should diminish. By itself, that does suggest the potential for some slight upward drift of inflation.\n\nThere is considerable uncertainty and debate about how much slack remains and how fast it’s likely to diminish. A key part of the debate centers on the recent fall in labor force participation—that is, the fraction of the population that’s looking for work. This decline in labor force participation started around the time the economy slowed at the beginning of the 2001 recession. The question is whether this is a cyclical phenomenon that will reverse as the current expansion picks up more steam, or whether it’s a new trend that’s independent of the business cycle. If it’s cyclical, and labor force participation does begin to rise, this will mean more downward pressure on inflation. If it’s not—that is, if participation does not rise or continues to fall—this will mean the remaining slack in the economy will diminish faster, creating upward pressure on inflation sooner. There are good arguments on both sides of this issue, and it’s too soon to tell from the data which one will prove to be more accurate. So, the bottom line is that there is some uncertainty about the true extent of slack and its impact on the inflation outlook.\n\nThe second factor which affects inflation is inflationary expectations. We learned during the 1970s that once people begin to expect higher inflation, those expectations may affect wage bargaining. Expecting higher inflation, workers demand, and firms are more likely to grant, correspondingly higher wage and salary increases. Once higher inflationary expectations become embodied in wage and salary bargaining, inflation can start spiraling upward. So, this possibility represents a risk for inflation.\n\nOne way to gauge whether inflationary expectations have risen is through financial market indicators, such as the spread between the yield on Treasury bonds and on Treasury inflation-indexed securities. This spread is a measure of the inflation compensation demanded by market participants. Recently there has been a noticeable increase in the average compensation for inflation over the next five years. Looking further out, however, we see almost no change in the compensation for inflation from five to ten years into the future. Survey measures of long-term inflation expectations have also been extremely stable. The stability of long-term inflation expectations presumably reflects the market’s view that the Fed will continue to demonstrate that it is willing to do what is necessary to ensure price stability in the U.S. economy.\n\nBoth slack and inflation expectations often work through changes in labor compensation to influence price increases. It’s hard to find evidence suggesting upward pressure through this channel. For example, over the past three years, the pattern of growth in total compensation in private industry, as measured by the employment cost index, has been pretty steady—about three and three-quarters percent. Looking behind these numbers, we find that they include both a deceleration in wages and salaries and unusually large increases in benefit costs. Looking ahead, recent surveys suggest that growth in health insurance costs is likely to moderate significantly this year. To some extent, such moderation could hold down overall compensation growth this year, since it’s doubtful that offsetting increases in wages and salaries would completely fill the gap that quickly.\n\nMoreover, there is another factor that could allow inflation to fall even if labor compensation were to begin to accelerate. The extent to which businesses have marked up the prices of their products over the unit labor costs they face has been extraordinarily large for some time now. This large mark-up could return to more normal levels through faster growth in labor compensation or falling inflation, or through some combination of the two. Historical experience with this adjustment suggests that the restraint on inflation could be quite significant even if compensation growth did begin to move upward. The high current markup thus represents the potential for downward pressure on inflation.\n\nA fourth set of factors influencing inflation includes the significant changes that have occurred in the price of oil and in the dollar over the past year or so. Both higher oil prices and the lower dollar would be expected to put moderate upward pressure on inflation, at least for a time. And, as I said, we’re probably seeing this already in the consumer price index. The key question is whether this upward pressure on inflation will persist. The answer depends on at least two developments. One, obviously, is whether oil prices keep rising and the dollar keeps falling. But predicting the direction of either oil prices or the dollar is notoriously difficult, so this uncertainty in itself is a double-edged risk for inflation. The second development again is inflation expectations. So long as oil prices and the dollar remain at their present levels, their effects on inflation are likely to be only temporary, implying that the size of the upward pressure should diminish over time. It is only if the current inflationary effects of these movements become embedded in inflation expectations and wage bargaining that they are likely to persist. But, as I argued earlier, long-term inflation expectations remain stable and labor compensation increases have been steady and moderate.\n\nThe final factor I want to mention that impacts inflation is productivity growth. For about ten years now, U.S. productivity growth has been very strong. It grew at around two and a half percent in the latter half of the 1990s and has increased even more rapidly—at an amazing four percent—so far in this decade. Of course, it’s not reasonable to expect the four percent pace to be maintained in the long run. A number of leading experts estimate the trend rate at around two and a half percent, still a very high number that would dramatically enhance living standards in this country over the years.\n\nHow does productivity growth affect inflation? With rapid productivity growth, firms have the capacity to expand production to meet growing demand with lower unit costs of production, and therefore they don’t need to raise prices as much to generate a profit. Eventually, of course, unit costs are likely to rise as workers seek higher wages to compensate them for their increased productivity. But during the adjustment period—which can last for a considerable period of time—there is downward pressure on inflation. By the same token, slower growth in productivity could lead to upward pressure on inflation for a time.\n\nThe issue for inflation going forward is whether productivity growth will match the trend rate of around two and a half percent that I mentioned before. If so, core inflation seems likely to remain stable, near its current moderate pace, assuming no new developments in compensation or profit margins. I see the risks in this regard as fairly well balanced. One argument on the side of slowing is related to stories we’ve heard about the business caution that was an important feature of the last recession. It’s understandable that the investment bust in the last recession, the tragedy of 9/11, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the corporate governance scandals could have eroded business confidence. And that may have made firms reluctant to take on the long-run commitment of adding workers. Some argue that this factor accounts for much of the productivity growth we saw since the recession. In this view, when firms become more confident about the future, they will hire more workers and productivity growth will slow. This argument would be more convincing if the data showed that firms are boosting their productivity by making their existing employees work longer hours. But the admittedly limited data we have—which covers only production and nonsupervisory workers—don’t show that. Rather, they show that hours have been declining since the late 1990s.\n\nThere are two other arguments on the side of slowing productivity growth. The first is related to the recent moderation in the pace of price declines for high-tech goods. This could imply that technological progress is slowing to some extent. Second is the recent weakness in high-tech investment, which would mean that firms may be beginning to engage in less so-called capital deepening—in other words, they may not be adding as much capital to the production process.\n\nWhile these developments are a source of concern, it’s too soon to tell if they’ll last very long. Moreover, there are a couple of reasons to think that firms may learn to use the technology they already have in place to become more productive, and that could keep productivity growing rapidly over the next several years. First, some evidence suggests that the extraordinarily high rates of investment in high-tech equipment during the second half of the 1990s actually led to a reduction in productivity growth—as much as half a percentage point during that period. The reason is that firms had to devote a lot of human capital and time to learn how to get the most out of it. If firms continue to increase their proficiency in using the technology they already have, this could help keep productivity growing at a robust pace. For example, one of our contacts told us that his law firm had discovered they could use computer search facilities to look for incriminating evidence in email files; that meant less labor on the project and therefore reduced legal expenses.\n\nSecond, one fundamental way that technology enhances productivity is by allowing firms to reorganize work-place processes. For example, major banks report that, through ongoing use of technology, they have been able to support growth in customers and services with fewer staff. A further example is the continuing expansion of Wal-Mart and other big-box stores, a trend that has had a dramatic effect on productivity growth in the retail and wholesale sectors. This process of using technology to reorganize work processes, of course, takes time. And all signs suggest that it is ongoing and likely to continue playing out for a good while.\n\nLet me summarize this discussion of the inflation outlook. When I look at all of the elements that influence inflation—slack, inflation expectations, mark-ups, oil prices, the dollar, and productivity—it seems that the most likely outcome over the next year or so is that inflation will remain well contained, which is definitely encouraging. Moreover, while I see a lot of uncertainty in the outlook, taken together the risks appear to be reasonably well balanced on the upside and the downside.\n\nMonetary Policy\nI’d like to conclude by returning briefly to where I began—with the FOMC’s press statement and the release of the minutes of the last meeting. As I said, my views are generally quite consistent with those in the statement. We know that the current policy stance is accommodative, and that, as the expansion firms up, that degree of accommodation will have to diminish. But the pace of removing policy accommodation will depend on how developments unfold. If the economy expands a good deal faster, or if we see the upside risks to inflation materialize, it may be appropriate to remove accommodation more rapidly. If the expansion slows, or if we experience some of the downside inflation risks, there will be more opportunities for the Committee to pause.\n\nI hope that my comments today have illustrated in part how the Committee’s consensus comes from some deep and careful thinking about a wide and complex variety of possible developments in the economy, much of which is laid out in the minutes. Perhaps I’ve even intrigued some of you who have never read the minutes to take a look at them. As I said, the decision to release them sooner is part of an important effort to make the central bank’s decisions in pursuit of price stability and maximum sustainable employment more transparent to the public.\n\n# # #"

            "content": "Thanks for that very kind introduction, Dean Mittelstaedt. It’s a pleasure to participate in your forecast luncheon, and I’m delighted to be able to set the stage for the other speakers by giving you my views on the outlook for the nation’s economy and the implications for monetary policy.\n\nAs Dean Mittelstaedt said, I began my tenure at the San Francisco Fed in June. Just a couple of weeks later, I attended my first meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee as a Reserve Bank President. At that June meeting, the Committee decided to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, the first increase in over three years. Since then, there have been three more meetings, and at each one, the Committee raised the funds rate by 25 basis points, bringing it now to two percent. With core consumer inflation running at one and a half to two percent, the real—or inflation-adjusted—rate has moved from negative territory, where it had been for more than three years, to a level of zero or a bit higher. The Committee’s November 10 th press release states that, even at the current, higher level of the funds rate, monetary policy remains accommodative. One indication of the continuing monetary stimulus is that the real federal funds rate remains well below its long-run average of around two and a half percent, depending on which inflation measure you use. The statement notes that this stimulus, combined with robust productivity growth, should provide ongoing support to economic activity.\n\nOne reason for the Committee’s decision to raise the federal funds rate is to undo, or “take back,” the policy of “exceptional easing” that the Committee put in place between 2001 and 2003. During that period, the economy was struggling to overcome the headwinds from the bursting of the stock market bubble, heightened geopolitical risk and a wave of corporate governance scandals. With substantial and growing labor market slack, there was even a concern about the risk of deflation. Though deflation was never very likely to be realized, it still made sense to address the risk by erring on the side of ease–taking out an “insurance policy” against the possibility. As Japan knows all too well, deflation can lead to serious economic problems.\n\nAnother rationale for the increase in the federal funds rate is that we have been seeing more positive signs in the economy and now can have greater confidence that the economy is on course for self-sustaining growth going forward. A broad range of economic data suggests that real GDP is now growing modestly above trend, which, by most estimates, is around three and a quarter to three and a half percent. Recently, we’ve seen good news on manufacturing output and consumer spending.\n\nFinally, and very importantly, the data on the labor market turned out to be stunningly good in October—the economy gained 337,000 jobs that month. After such a long—and, I might add, surprisingly long—period when employment growth seemed to be stuck in the doldrums, this news is very heartening. Growth in wage and salary income is critical to consumer spending. More rapid employment growth thus improves the prospects for consumer spending, raising the odds that the remaining slack in the labor market will decline gradually over time.\n\nThese results for the economy certainly look pretty good. But I think there are some important issues to consider about the economy’s performance so far that may have implications for the outlook—and for monetary policy—going forward. In particular, it’s important to recognize that, in order to get this performance, monetary policy has had to be extremely accommodative and for a very long time. Indeed, the economy has been getting a push not only from substantial monetary stimulus, but also from substantial fiscal stimulus, including several tax cut packages and increased spending on defense and homeland security.\n\nSo today, I’d like to spend a few moments exploring why this might be happening—that is, exploring what factors might be putting a drag on demand in the U.S., necessitating a lot of stimulus just to achieve trendlike growth. I’m going to focus on five factors altogether. Three appear to be having an impact now and may continue to do so next year; they are: higher oil prices, “restraint” in investment spending, and a large and growing trade gap. The remaining two have not had an impact yet, but they have the potential to exert a drag on the economy going forward; they are: the low personal saving rate and the waning impetus from fiscal policy.\n\nI’ll start with the oil price shock. The price of oil nearly doubled—from around thirty dollars a barrel last summer to fifty-five dollars—though most recently it has fallen back to between forty-five and fifty dollars. Higher oil prices act like a tax on households to depress spending on other goods and services at least to some extent. Let me hasten to say that this effect is nowhere near as dire as it was when oil price shocks hit the U.S. economy thirty years ago. For one thing, even at fifty dollars a barrel, in real terms, oil prices are only about half what they were in the 1970s. For another, the U.S. economy is much less dependent on oil today than it was thirty years ago.\n\nNonetheless, higher oil prices do appear to be damping spending. Insofar as the higher prices are transitory, we’d expect consumers and firms not to change their spending patterns much, instead defending their living standards for the duration by consuming fewer oil products and by dipping into savings. But the concern is that oil prices may not be transitory—they may stay high, or go even higher. If that were to happen, we could expect consumers and firms to seal up their wallets somewhat tighter.\n\nIt’s extremely difficult to predict what will happen to oil prices, of course. But some recent evidence from the futures markets can give us at least a sense of the probabilities. That evidence suggests that the market sees a large portion of the recent oil shock as long-lasting. Futures prices are not predicting as sharp a falloff in prices as they usually would.\n\nHigher oil prices also have an impact on inflation—at least for a time. The real issue here is whether that uptick in inflation gets incorporated into inflation expectations. We learned during the 1970s that once that happens, wages and prices get built around those expectations, and inflation can start spiraling upward. Is this likely to happen now? Fortunately, it does not seem very likely. Again, we can turn to the markets for a sense of what inflation expectations look like. Recently there has been a noticeable increase in the average compensation for inflation over the next five years implicit in the spread between the yield on Treasury bonds and on Treasury inflation-indexed securities. Part of this undoubtedly reflects higher oil prices. But there has been almost no change in the compensation for inflation from five to ten years into the future. The stability of compensation for this period presumably reflects the market’s view that the Fed will remain vigilant in its long-run commitment to controlling inflation. Of course, actions ultimately speak louder than expectations, and the Fed will have to continue to demonstrate that it is willing to do what is necessary to ensure price stability in the U.S. economy.\n\nA second drag on the U.S. economy relates to business investment. It may seem surprising to pinpoint capital spending as a drag since growth in this type of spendinghas been strong. However, it is probably less strong than one would expect, given the very favorable “ fundamentals”— the low real interest rates that we’ve seen in recent years, solidly growing demand, and very high corporate profits and cash flow; indeed, for the first time in decades, business cash flow has actually exceeded total capital investment. This may suggest a continuation of the caution that has marked business decisionmaking in the wake of the terrorist threats and the issues surrounding corporate governance.\n\nAnother element that could put the brakes on business investment is a slowdown in the high-tech sector. The data aren’t conclusive on this point, but they are suggestive: In the third quarter, real investment in high-tech fell to nine and a half percent—about half what it was over the prior four quarters—high-tech manufacturing production slowed noticeably since midyear, and stock prices for some major high-tech firms slid; insofar as stock prices are good predictors, this suggests a more subdued outlook. So, taken together, these data suggest that we should be cautious about assuming that the heady days of massive IT investment are likely to return any time soon. The peak of strength in IT investment occurred at the end of 2000 when it was boosted by several special factors. One was the capital spending binge by telecom service providers. A second was the build-up to Y2K. A third was the very rapid pace of diffusion of personal computers and networks, a pace which may prove difficult to maintain much longer. Moreover, over the last year, we’ve seen that quality-adjusted computer prices haven’t been falling as fast, and that may signal some slowing of technological innovation in this sector. Finally, there is some industry opinion that the pace of software development is beginning to drop off.\n\nA third drag on the economy relates to the trade gap. It has risen from near balance in the mid-1990s to a deficit of around $600 billion now, and it subtracted around a full percentage point from real GDP growth in the first half of this year. Narrowing the trade gap depends—in part—on the strength of domestic demand among our trading partners, because that affects demand for our exports. However, most of our major trading partners have had only sluggish growth in domestic demand recently, although their overall real GDP growth has been relatively healthy. One economy with strong domestic demand has been China; but, even there, concerns about overheating have led to efforts to restrain its economy. So long as these conditions prevail among our trading partners, they will not provide much impetus for growth in our own economy. Finally, non-oil import prices have risen by just under three percent over the past year, hardly enough to stem the trend of rising imports into this country.\n\nLet me turn to two factors that are not now, but have the potential to be, drags on the economy going forward. First is the very low personal saving rate, which has fallen over the past decade from about seven percent to under half a percent in the third quarter of this year. Part of the reason that consumers are saving so little out of disposable income is that interest rates are low. In addition, their wealth has been on the rise; in the latter half of the 1990s, rising stock prices had a lot to do with the increase in wealth, but more recently, the main impetus has been house price appreciation. With interest rates rising now and housing prices unlikely to continuing advancing at their recent robust pace, consumers may want to get their finances in order and curtail their spending in order to bring the saving rate up to more normal levels.\n\nFiscal policy is another factor that will come into play next year. The effects of the tax cuts and spending increases have been significantly positive for economic growth last year and this year. Next year, however, if current plans remain in place, the impetus from fiscal policy will wane. Most estimates suggest that fiscal policy could turn to being roughly neutral by 2005. This means that the main impetus to growth will have to come from private sector spending.\n\nLet me next turn to the outlook for inflation. Over the last twelve months, inflation in the core CPI—that is, in the index excluding volatile food and energy prices–has come in at a moderate 2 percent. However, in the past couple of months, the readings have been a bit higher, most likely reflecting some pass-through of higher oil prices into core prices as well as increases in both commodity and import prices. This uptick in core CPI inflation bears close watching, but it’s not a big concern at this point for a few reasons. First, inflation figures can be a bit volatile from month to month, so two months of data aren’t enough to establish a trend. Second, another measure of core inflation—based on the personal consumption expenditures index—has been more modest. Third, as I mentioned earlier, supply-side effects should raise inflation only temporarily unless they become embedded in inflation expectations. And longer-run inflationary expectations seem to be well-anchored because the Fed’s strong commitment to maintaining price stability is well understood. Furthermore, slack still remains in the labor market and that slack is working to moderate the pace of wage and salary increases, putting continued downward pressure on inflation. So despite the uncertainties raised by oil prices, inflation—especially core consumer inflation—seems to be relatively well-contained at present.\n\nI’d like to end my remarks today with some thoughts about the challenges monetary policymakers are confronting now. We know that the current policy stance is accommodative, and that, as the expansion firms up, that degree of accommodation will have to diminish. But, by how much and at what pace? This will depend importantly on what actually happens to employment, output and inflation going forward.\n\nIf the various drags on aggregate demand I’ve been discussing show signs of lessening, it may be appropriate to remove accommodation more rapidly. If they continue to weigh on the economy, or worsen, there will be more opportunities for the Committee to pause. The challenge, then, for monetary policymakers is to be on high watch as developments unfold, to evaluate them with an open mind, and to adjust the course of policy to achieve our dual mandate—promoting price stability and maximum sustainable employment.\n\n# # #"

            "content": "Good afternoon. I’d like to thank you for inviting me here today to discuss my views on the nation’s economy and on monetary policy.\n\nI know that I’m in the midst of a group of professionals who specialize in risk management. Since risk management is a focus of our work at the Fed, we have much in common. Indeed, I understand that some people on the staff of the San Francisco Fed who work in this area are members of the Global Association of Risk Professionals, one of the co-hosts of today’s meeting. One of the Fed’s key roles is to address issues of risk in the financial services sector. We supervise state banks that are members of the Federal Reserve as well as bank and financial holding companies. During the last decade, our examinations have become increasingly centered on the ability of the institutions we supervise to measure, monitor, and manage risk. Improvements in the risk management techniques employed in these organizations have, in my opinion, made our financial system far more resilient to shocks. Financial institutions weathered the Russian default, the turmoil caused by the collapse of Long Term Capital Management, the bursting of the stock market bubble, and the recent economic downturn exceptionally well.\n\nA completely different responsibility that involves significant elements of risk management is the Federal Reserve’s conduct of monetary policy. One of our key functions is to respond to shocks—that is, to unexpected events—that may undermine the performance of the U.S. economy. And that’s one of the things I want to focus on today.\n\nWe certainly have had some major shocks in recent years. I’m not thinking only of the current oil price shock, which is a serious issue and one I’ll go into later. I’m also thinking of several other shocks that have hit the economy over the last several years, and that, to some extent, are still reverberating.\n\nOne of those shocks has, for the most part, been very positive. It began back when I was on the Board of Governors in Washington in the mid-1990s. I’m speaking, of course, of the phenomenal surge in productivity, which was largely associated with advances in technology and investments in the equipment embodying that technology. For the past nine years, productivity in the U.S. has grown at a pace of over three percent a year—three times as fast as the average growth rate during the 1970s, the 1980s, and the early 1990s. Faster productivity growth has had some very positive effects on the economy. It has raised the economy’s potential to grow and thus the pace of expansion that the economy can sustain in the long run. Productivity growth is the main driver of long-term trends in worker compensation. Faster productivity growth has therefore allowed average living standards to advance much more rapidly than before. Faster productivity growth enables firms to hold down costs. It thereby places downward pressure on inflation, helping us move toward price stability.\n\nBut faster productivity growth also had repercussions that created challenges for monetary policy. In the second half of the 1990s, this extraordinary productivity surge—coupled with the buildup to Y2K—led to a boom in investment that apparently went too far, collapsing into an investment bust by 2000. Faster productivity growth also likely contributed to the excessive run-up and subsequent correction in stock prices. In 2001, of course, came the shock of the tragic events of 9/11, followed by the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. On the heels of that came another shock—the corporate governance scandals. The result was serious erosion in confidence and extreme caution in the business sector.\n\nIn response to these negative shocks, monetary policymakers responded aggressively, slashing short-term interest rates in 2001 to their lowest levels in forty years. The risk of deflation prompted additional policy measures in 2003. The odds that the U.S. economy would slip into outright deflation were never very high. But the severity of the economic repercussions should deflation take hold warranted an extraordinary monetary policy response. Befitting its role as a “risk manager,” the Fed addressed this serious “downside risk” by taking out an “ insurance policy”—lowering the federal funds rate to 1 percent and stating its belief that monetary accommodation could likely be maintained for a “considerable period.”\n\nThe Fed’s actions helped to support consumer spending, particularly auto sales, and housing. These sectors stayed strong despite the 2001 recession and the lackluster performance that followed for the next year and a half. Two large tax cut packages in 2001 and 2003 coupled with a pickup in spending for defense and homeland security also provided fiscal impetus. By early 2004, the economy finally seemed to be on the road to a solid recovery: growth averaged a robust five percent between the first quarter of 2003 and the first quarter of 2004. Firms restructured their balance sheets. And the pace of investment spending picked up. The pace of job creation also increased: from March to May of this year, payroll employment rose at an average of nearly 300,000 jobs per month.\n\nUnfortunately, toward the end of the second quarter of 2004, the economy apparently stumbled. Growth for the whole quarter came in at only three and a quarter percent, dragged down by especially sluggish growth in consumer spending. It is difficult to know exactly why consumer spending slowed, but higher oil prices head the list of likely culprits. Higher oil prices are imposing a tax on households amounting to roughly $75 billion on an annual basis. The good news is that we’ve seen an improvement in the growth of consumer spending since early summer. In the third quarter, consumer spending on goods and services, including autos, appears to have rebounded from its sluggish performance in June. A partial glimpse at the third quarter’s overall growth performance suggests a pickup in the growth of real GDP to a rate around 4 percent. The bad news is that the labor market has yet to regain its footing completely, generating only 100,000 jobs a month from June through September. Job creation on that scale is below what is needed to reduce the slack that remains in labor markets.\n\nThis brings me to the outlook. While recent results for activity are somewhat encouraging, I wouldn’t say that we’re completely “out of the woods” just yet. Indeed, there are some issues that have the potential to be troublesome going forward. As “risk managers” for the nation’s economy, I think monetary policymakers need to pay attention to these issues, so I’d like to take a moment to touch on a few of them.\n\nThe first is oil. The price of oil rose from around $30 per barrel last summer to around $55 recently. Clearly, there’s pressure from the supply side, given the significant political instability in major oil-producing regions like the Middle East, Venezuela, Russia, and Nigeria. In addition, the world’s limited refining capacity is an issue, which certainly was not helped by the recent hurricanes in the southeastern U.S. Along with this pressure from the supply side, these price hikes also are connected to very strong demand for oil—not only in the U.S. but also in emerging Asia, especially China—and that’s leading to a sharp increase in oil consumption.\n\nThe risk, of course, is that higher oil prices can put a further drag on spending and simultaneously create inflationary pressure. In saying that, I don’t mean to conjure up the grim days of the 1970s, when oil price shocks hit the economy very hard. Although oil prices are at all-time highs in nominal terms, they’re only about half of what they were thirty years ago on an inflation-adjusted basis. Moreover, in the course of those thirty years, the U.S. economy has also become much less dependent on oil. So the effect on today’s economy is nowhere near as huge as it was on the economy back then. But what adds to concerns about the higher oil prices is the possibility that they might continue, or even worsen, cutting further into people’s and firms’ ability to spend. Generally, when oil prices spike, the futures market expects them to retreat quickly. But recent developments suggest that the market sees a large portion of the recent oil shock as long-lasting, since the futures prices a year or so ahead have risen by almost as much as the current price. If an oil price spike is perceived as transitory, households are more likely to maintain existing spending patterns by lowering saving. Persistent oil price hikes, in contrast, seem likely to generate a larger and more persistent consumption response.\n\nHigher oil prices inevitably raise headline inflation for a time. The real risk, as we learned during the 1970s, is that an uptick in inflation due to oil can become incorporated into inflationary expectations and built into subsequent wage and price setting. Such an outcome is unlikely if inflationary expectations are well-anchored. The evidence suggests that inflationary expectations are well-anchored. We see this not only in a variety of surveys, but also in the markets, where there has been little change in the inflation compensation implicit in the spread between the yield on Treasury bonds and on Treasury inflation-indexed securities. That said, the Federal Reserve cannot take the public’s trust in its commitment to price stability for granted. It must remain vigilant and willing to act to insure price stability. As I said, oil markets represent a risk, and one that will have more serious repercussions the longer oil prices stay high.\n\nBeyond the oil price shock, I think it’s worth looking at other developments that also can weigh on consumers and businesses and tend to make them rein in their spending. In terms of the consumer, the sluggish job market could significantly restrain spending, as it lowers growth in disposable income and threatens to undermine consumer confidence. Another potential source of restraint going forward is the very low personal saving rate. As I’m sure you know, consumers were a very important prop to the economy during the recession and the recovery. In fact, their resilience was pretty surprising. But to keep that up, they had to spend an ever increasing fraction of their disposable incomes. Of course, at the same time, consumers have also seen increases in wealth, especially their housing assets. It remains to be seen how long the pattern of low savings will be maintained, especially if house prices were to increase more gradually or decline. Any noticeable attempt by households to improve their finances by cutting spending could seriously undermine the strength of the expansion.\n\nAnother area of risk—and one that may seem surprising—is business investment. Although it has been strong, it is probably less strong than one might expect, given the highly favorable “fundamentals”—very high corporate profits and cash flow, the low real interest rates that we’ve seen in recent years, and solidly growing demand. However, for the first time in decades, business cash flow has actually exceeded total capital investment. This suggests a continuation of the caution that has marked business decisionmaking in the wake of the terrorist threats and the issues surrounding corporate governance. This caution may also explain the inability of the labor market to establish sustained strength.\n\nIf this cautious attitude were to continue, it could become especially troublesome next year as the impetus to the economy from fiscal stimulus wanes. Most estimates suggest that, while the effects of the tax cuts and spending increases have been significantly positive for economic growth last year and this year, they will turn to being roughly neutral by 2005. This means that the main impetus to growth will have to come from business investment and consumption.\n\nFinally, there’s the issue of the trade gap. It has risen from near balance in the mid-1990s to a deficit of around $600 billion now, and it subtracted around a full percentage point from real GDP growth in the first half of this year. Traditionally, the U.S. economy has been considered a relatively closed economy, so that developments in trade had only minor implications for our economic growth. However, with the trade gap currently so large, uncertainty about its future course now poses significant issues for our real GDP growth. And its future course depends importantly on the strength of domestic demand among our trading partners because that affects demand for our exports. However, most of our major trading partners have had only sluggish growth in domestic demand recently, although their overall real GDP growth has been relatively healthy. One economy with strong domestic demand has been China; but, even there, concerns about overheating have led to efforts restrain its economy. So long as these conditions prevail among our trading partners, they will not provide much impetus for growth in our own economy.\n\nNow let me turn briefly to the inflation outlook. Higher oil prices, coupled with increases in both commodity and import prices pushed up overall inflation in the CPI to over a 4 percent rate in the first half of this year. Core inflation also rose at a somewhat elevated 2-1/2 percent in the first half of this year. However, both indexes dropped back to more subdued rates in the third quarter—2 percent for the overall index and 1-1/2 percent for core inflation. As I noted earlier, longer-run inflationary expectations seem subdued.. So despite the uncertainties raised by oil prices, inflation—especially core consumer inflation—seems to be relatively well contained at present. Moreover, there are some fundamental factors tending to push inflation down, including the remaining slack in labor and product markets and continued rapid growth in productivity.\n\nNow let me try to pull all of these threads together and lay out what they imply from the perspective of monetary policy. At this point, policy, in my view, is still accommodative. The federal funds rate is at one and three-quarters percent, and, with overall inflation a bit higher than that over the past year, the “real” or inflation-adjusted federal funds rate is slightly below zero, well below its historical average of around 2 ¾% over the last forty years. This suggests that short-term interest rates eventually have to go up to prevent an increase in inflation. The policy challenge is to consider two questions: “how far?” and “how fast?”\n\nTo begin to answer the question “how far,” economists compare the funds rate to a benchmark called the long-run equilibrium or “neutral” real rate. This is the rate that would be consistent with full employment of labor and capital resources and price stability over the long run. I should emphasize that estimates of the long-run equilibrium rate are highly uncertain and may change over time due to changes in productivity growth, the structural budget deficit, and other fundamentals. Analysts commonly compute the “neutral” real rate via computations with econometric models of the economy. Such models tend to put the mean “neutral” real rate in a range of 2 to 3%, which is in the vicinity of its actual 40-year historical average. Of course, an inflation component must be added to obtain a neutral value for the nominal funds rate. With the real federal funds rate currently near zero, such calculations suggest that the real funds rate eventually will need to rise considerably above its current level for policy just to have a neutral effect on the economy.\n\nIn making decisions in real time, however, policymakers also need to estimate an intermediate-term equilibrium real rate that would promote full employment over the next several years. I’ve spent some time today discussing a number of demand factors that have tended to restrain growth, or threaten to restrain growth in the future; in other words, these factors may be holding the intermediate-term equilibrium real rate down. A first factor is the waning of the stimulus from fiscal policy next year. A second factor may be the unusual business caution that seems to be playing a role in sluggish job growth and investment spending that is not as strong as would be expected based on the “fundamentals” commonly incorporated into econometric models. While it’s difficult to pin down the exact nature and extent of this caution, terrorism and uncertainty about corporate governance and the energy supply are commonly cited by corporate executives.\n\nAnother factor that may be working in the same direction is the dollar, which has remained relatively high despite our large and growing trade deficit. A high dollar makes imports less expensive for us and makes our exports more expensive abroad, thereby undermining the demand for domestic output. In order to offset this drag on the demand for domestically produced goods and services, interest rates must be lower than would otherwise be necessary to produce full employment in our economy. A relatively high dollar depresses the equilibrium real rate.\n\nSo, for a number of reasons, the intermediate-run equilibrium real rate appears to be below its historic average and below model-based estimates of the long-term rate. I want to emphasize that there are probably even more uncertainties involved in estimating the intermediate-term equilibrium rate than there are in estimating the long-term rate. That’s why I wouldn’t be confident at all about giving you an actual estimate of the intermediate rate. But I do think it’s likely that the intermediate rate is below the long-term rate. This means that while policy is stimulative, it’s not as stimulative as suggested by estimates of the long-term equilibrium rate.\n\nAt its last three meetings, the FOMC tightened policy slightly. The Committee indicated in its statement that, based upon what it then knew, removal of policy accommodation at a “ measured pace” would most likely prove appropriate to promote a healthy outlook for the economy—a moderate acceleration in growth with well-contained inflation. Of course, we must remain very watchful as developments unfold, and be prepared to consider modifications in our course of action as needed to ensure price stability and full employment. For example, there would be a need to consider moving more aggressively if inflation showed signs of rising significantly. But as I said, core inflation appears to be well contained. Alternatively, there might be a need to consider pausing in the process of raising rates if slower growth in demand caused economic activity or labor market activity to slow down, perhaps for some of the reasons I’ve emphasized in my remarks today. By the same token, if inflation were to fall much further below recent rates, we would need to consider pausing.\n\nOverall, it seems clear that the federal funds rate will need to rise as we go forward, but the pace of that increase will need to be closely linked to unfolding events. And I think it’s important that we keep the public well informed of our thinking on these issues.\n\nIndeed, an emphasis on communication and transparency has become a key feature of current monetary policy. One reason for the focus on communication is that economic developments are affected by longer-term interest rates, equity values, the exchange rate, and other asset values—and these factors depend not only on the current funds rate, but more importantly on the expected future path of the funds rate. Clear, straightforward language that helps explain to markets and the public what the Fed is looking at, and why, can make policy more effective by fostering the appropriate expectations and decisions. Moreover, it also can help policymakers avoid creating theirown shocks, which can lead to disruptions in financial markets.\n\nI hope that my comments today have done their part to communicate clearly my thinking as a Fed policymaker. Now I’ll be glad to take any questions.\n\n# # #"

            "content": "\n\nGood afternoon. And thank you, George, for that kind introduction. This is my first public speech as President of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, and it’s a pleasure to be making my debut here in Seattle. Thank you all very much for coming. While it would be a privilege to serve as the head of any Reserve Bank, I’m especially happy to have the chance to head the San Francisco Fed—and not only because the West has been my home for many years. As you probably know, this Reserve District is the largest of the twelve in terms of geography and population. It comprises about 20% of the nation’s economy. And it’s also home to a number of industries and innovations that have significant impacts on the nation’s economy. Like my predecessor, Bob Parry, I think it’s important for a Fed President to learn about the District by actually traveling around in it and getting to know the economy and the people first-hand. And it’s very nice that part of getting that first-hand knowledge in this job involves visiting great cities like Seattle.\n\nAs George said, this is not my first stint as a Fed official. Now that I’ve returned, I’ve been very glad—though not at all surprised—to find that the high standards of public service I’ve always associated with the Fed remain solidly in place. There have been some changes, however. One in particular—and it’s a change for the better, I believe—is the FOMC’s effort at communication. The Committee has been placing a great deal of emphasis on explaining the logic of its decisions concerning the nation’s monetary policy.\n\nFor example, the June and August FOMC statements made clear that the current policy stance is highly accommodative, so short-term interest rates have to go up to prevent an eventual increase in inflation. The policy challenge is to consider the question: “how fast?” At this point, we still face some uncertainties about the strength of the economic expansion and the strength of job creation. At the same time, we’ve had some reassuring indications that the surge in core inflation a few months ago was a short-lived phenomenon, although rising oil prices have pushed up measures of overall inflation. In light of these conditions, it made sense that the Fed engineered only modest increases in the federal funds rate in both June and August.\n\nMy aim today is to elaborate on these points a bit and to lay out some context for thinking about the issues facing monetary policy going forward. I should add that my remarks reflect my own opinions, and they are not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe current economic situation\n\nLet me begin by trying to characterize the current economic situation. Although we’re nearly three years past the official date of the end of the last recession, in some important ways, I think the economy is still operating in its wake. One of the hallmarks of the 2001 recession was the “investment bust,” which seems to have stemmed from a case of “too much of a good thing.” The extraordinary productivity surge in the second half of 1990s—plus the buildup to Y2K—led to an investment boom that apparently went too far. The effects of the investment bust on the economy were compounded by the tragic events of 9/11 and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Added to this was disquieting news about corporate governance scandals, which undermined confidence. As a result, businesses seemed to be extremely cautious about their spending and hiring decisions.\n\nTo counter these developments, monetary policy responded aggressively, slashing short-term interest rates to their lowest levels in forty years. The series of sizable tax packages passed by Congress, along with a pickup in spending on defense and homeland security, provided additional stimulus to spending. In the spring of 2003, the Fed again responded when the specter of deflation seemed to loom. It took out an “insurance policy” to address this grave risk by lowering the federal funds rate to 1 percent.\n\nThese actions helped support consumer spending, which fortunately stayed strong despite the 2001 recession and the “soft patch” that followed for the next year and a half. In early 2003, the economy finally seemed to kick into gear, with growth averaging a robust five percent between the first quarter of 2003 and the first quarter of 2004. And with this strength in the economy, we started seeing healthy growth in jobs again: from March to May of this year, payroll employment rose at an average of nearly 300,000 jobs per month.\n\nBut in the second quarter of this year, growth slowed to under 3 percent, and the partial data available on the current quarter suggest perhaps only moderately faster growth—somewhere in the range of the economy’s long-run potential growth rate. It appears that businesses and consumers have, in a sense, “switched places,” with business investment in equipment and software now growing rapidly, while the consumer is showing some sluggishness. Notably, the labor market stumbled, too, generating only 85,000 jobs per month in June and July. The August data on employment were better—about 144,000 jobs were added—but that’s still just barely enough growth to keep pace with increases in the size of the labor force.\n\nThe August 10 th FOMC statement said that the slowdown “… likely owes importantly to the substantial rise in energy prices.” In terms of the outlook, the statement says that “the economy nevertheless appears poised to resume a stronger pace of expansion going forward.” A basic premise of the statement is that a rise in oil prices to a new higher level is likely to have only a transitory effect on output growth. In other words, even if oil prices remained at a high level, real GDP growth would be expected to bounce back. In addition, the economy continues to benefit from substantial monetary policy stimulus and a continuing need for businesses to rebuild their capital stocks after the “investment bust.”\n\nI want to spend a few moments discussing the oil price increases, because their role in the economy has important implications for the conduct of monetary policy.\n\nThe role of the oil price increases\nThe price of oil rose from around $30 per barrel last summer to around $45 recently. As the wholesale and retail markups over crude oil prices surged, gasoline prices rose even more sharply, although these margins have fallen substantially over the past couple of months. Not surprisingly, the oil price increases have spilled over into other energy markets like natural gas.\n\nThis oil shock is connected to concerns about the supply of oil, given all the political instability in the Middle East, Venezuela, Russia, and Nigeria—each seemingly for different reasons. At the same time, demand for oil is very strong—not only in the U.S. but also in emerging Asia, especially China—and that’s leading to a sharp increase in oil consumption.\n\nWhile oil prices are certainly high enough to grab our attention, the situation is a far cry from what happened when oil prices shot up in the 1970s. It’s true that oil prices have hit all-time highs in nominal terms; but, if we adjust them for the general price level, they’re only about half of what they were thirty years ago. And over these thirty years, the U.S. economy has become much less dependent on oil. In fact, oil consumption as a fraction of overall income is only about two-thirds of what it was back then.\n\nNonetheless, a hike of this size can restrain economic growth for a time. An intuitive way to think about it is to view the price increase as a kind of “tax” that U.S. households and businesses pay to foreign oil-producing countries. Essentially, an increase in oil prices can absorb income that could have been spent on other items.\n\nHow big might that “tax” be? A back-of-the-envelope estimate suggests that the recent increase amounts to a “tax” of about $65 billion. The more important question is, how much of an effect would a “tax” of that size have on real GDP growth. Economic models—which, as always, are at best aproximations—suggest that the size of the effect is likely to be modest, reducing real GDP growth in 2004 by somewhere in the range of less than a quarter percent to about half a percent.\n\nIt might seem surprising that the effect of this “tax” is so small, but a major reason has to do with the way households and firms typically respond to the tax. When they face reduced incomes from this tax, they tend to change their spending patterns in a couple of ways that mitigate its impact on demand and therefore on growth. First, they usually try to avoid the tax by consuming less oil, and this response gets bigger as time passes. Second, they typically cut back their spending on things other than oil only gradually; that is, they try to maintain their spending for a while by dipping into savings and profits, so this also cushions the oil price effect.\n\nIf people see the price increase as temporary, they’re likely to cut back spending rather less; and if they see the price increase as permanent, they’d tend to cut back spending more. Developments in the oil futures market suggest that people may see a large portion of the recent oil shock as permanent, since the futures prices a year or so ahead have risen by almost as much as the current price. This is unusual; generally, when oil prices spike, the futures market expects a quick reversal. So there’s reason to think that households and businesses may cut back spending more, indicating that the higher end of the range of estimated effects may be more appropriate.\n\nThe oil price hikes could be taking an even bigger chunk out of real GDP growth if they were undermining confidence, because that, in turn, would hold consumer spending down as well. This phenomenon has been observed in some other instances; the 1990 oil shock associated with the first Iraq war is a good example. However, at least as measured by surveys, consumer confidence has held up reasonably well. Finally, there’s another reason to question whether this oil shock has had exceptionally large effects on U.S. output; namely, other industrialized countries that depend on foreign oil have exhibited only modest effects so far.\n\nSo, my overall assessment of the oil shock is that it undoubtedly played a role in the current slowdown, but exactly how much it accounts for is a complicated question. To the extent that it is playing a larger, rather than a smaller, role, we might expect more of a bounceback in growth once the oil shock effect passes through the economy.\n\nThe outlook\nThis brings me to the outlook. In my view, it wouldn’t be surprising to see growth pick up enough to exceed the rate that can be sustained in the long run, thus gradually moving the labor market toward full employment. This would be a desirable result, because, by my calculations, considerable slack is still left in labor markets. Some recent data support the notion that growth may be rebounding. For example, much of the slowdown from the first quarter to the second quarter is accounted for by auto production. Auto sales have picked up so far in the third quarter after dropping in the second quarter, which suggests that more production may follow. Other data, including manufacturing output, housing construction, and consumer spending on goods and services, also have rebounded from their weak performances in June. And, as I mentioned, the labor market data for August did pick up moderately. These results are encouraging.\n\nHowever, there are some issues that have the potential to be troublesome going forward. As “risk managers” for the nation’s economy, I think monetary policymakers need to pay attention to these issues, so I’d like to take a moment to touch on some of them.\n\nOne concern is the personal saving rate. Over the past decade or so, the personal saving rate has fallen from the 7 to 8 percent range to a range of ½ percent to 2 percent. With interest rates rising and equity prices declining this year, households may try to get their finances in order and bring the saving rate up to more normal levels by cutting spending. A noticeable increase from today’s historically low levels could have important adverse consequences for the pace of economic expansion going forward. Such a development could be made more likely if household confidence is undermined by another spate of weakness in the jobs market—or, indeed, by a jobs picture that isn’t showing a pretty strong upward trend.\n\nIn addition, with the major declines in mortgage rates behind us, the volume of mortgage refinancings has plummeted over the past year or so. Conceivably, equity withdrawals from cash-out refinancings provided a greater boost to spending in recent years than was commonly recognized, and the loss of this source of funds could undermine demand.\n\nFinally, though business investment has been strong, it has been less than one might expect, given the very high corporate profits and cash flow that we’ve seen in recent years. In fact, for the first time in decades, business cash flow has actually exceeded total capital investment. This suggests a continuation of the caution that has marked business decisionmaking in the wake of the terrorist threats and the issues surrounding corporate governance. This caution could be behind the inability of the labor market to establish sustained strength. As the impetus to the economy from fiscal stimulus wanes next year, strength in consumer and business spending will prove critical to the sustainability of the expansion.\n\nThe inflation situation\nNow let me turn to inflation. We had a bit of scare earlier this year. After rising by only 1-1/2 percent in 2002 and then increasing at an even lower rate in 2003, the core PCE price index showed increases of around 2 percent in the first half of this year. The FOMC was faced with the question of whether this uptick was a one-off phenomenon or the beginning of a new higher trend. It now looks more likely that it was one-off for a couple of reasons. First, the surge could simply have been an offset to the unexplained and exceptionally low rate in 2002. This possibility now seems more likely given that core inflation from May through July has dropped back to the lower rates seen earlier.\n\nSecond, some of the uptick undoubtedly was due to higher oil prices being passed through to prices of core goods and services. A higher price of oil can lead to a permanently higher overall price level, and this can show up in inflation rates for a while. Moreover, if oil prices were to keep rising for a time, the boost to inflation could be extended. But ultimately, a higher price of oil is unlikely to raise the rate of inflation permanently unless it gets built in to expectations of future inflation and therefore into wage bargaining. In any event, both inflation expectations and actual inflation remain well contained, at least for now.\n\nMoreover, while significant risks to the inflation rate remain, they seem well balanced on both the high side and the low side. On the high side, the obvious risk is that oil prices could rise even further. They have been surprising most forecasters for over a year now. If this pattern continues, it would tend to boost core inflation for a time.\n\nOn the low side, profit margins have been extraordinarily large, and the mark-up of goods prices over unit labor costs has risen to a new high. Basically, the rapid productivity gains we’ve seen have held down business costs, and most of these gains have gone into higher profits rather than higher compensation for labor. This large mark-up could return to more normal levels through falling inflation or through faster growth in labor compensation. We saw such a run-up and rapid reversion toward normality during the second half of the 1990s. It’s possible that if prices and wages share the adjustment over the next year and a half—consistent with typical historical experience—the restraint on inflation could be quite significant.\n\nMonetary policy implications\nWhat does all of this mean for monetary policy? As I’ve pointed out, policy is still very accommodative, with the federal funds rate at one and half percent and inflation at about the same rate so that the “real” or inflation-adjusted federal funds rate is close to zero. To get an idea of how far we are from a neutral stance, economists compare the funds rate to a benchmark called the equilibrium rate. This is the rate that would be consistent with full employment of labor and capital resources over the intermediate run, after incorporating the inflation rate and taking into account the rate of productivity growth in the economy, various demand factors like fiscal policy, international developments, and other factors. Estimates of the equilibrium rate are highly uncertain and may change over time. That said, most estimates put the current equilibrium rate in the range of 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent. In other words, according to these estimates, the funds rate would need to rise considerably above its current level for policy just to have a neutral effect on the economy. With the actual funds rate currently as low as it is, there is thus reason for a strong presumption that rates will need to keep going up as we move forward.\n\nIn both June and August, the Federal Open Market Committee tightened policy slightly. The Committee indicated in its statement that, based upon what it then knew, removal of policy accommodation at a “measured pace” would most likely prove appropriate to promote the outlook for the economy that I’ve described—a moderate acceleration in growth with well-contained inflation.\n\nOf course, the Committee must remain very watchful as developments unfold, and be prepared to consider modifications in its course of action as needed to ensure price stability. For example, there could be a need to consider moving more aggressively if inflation showed signs of rising significantly. But as I said, there is reason to feel somewhat more comfortable than I did a few months ago that core inflation is still well contained. On the other hand, there might be a need to consider pausing in the process of raising rates if slower growth in demand caused economic activity to slow down. This concern seems less acute than it did a month or so ago. But I still see it as a significant issue, warranting careful attention.\n\nThe Committee would face a particularly tough policy choice if higher oil prices were to exact a continuing toll on economic activity. We know from history that oil shocks put monetary policymakers on the horns of a dilemma, because those shocks both raise inflation and reduce output. The dilemma is: Do we fight inflation and risk weakening the economy even more? Or do we boost the economy and risk even higher inflation? Fortunately, we have the benefit of hindsight to give us some guidance. We learned some bitter lessons from the oil crisis of the 1970s; in particular, we learned that monetary policy should not be so accommodative that higher inflation gets built in to inflation expectations and wage bargaining. Once this happens, it can be extremely difficult to rein inflation in without creating a severe recession. Therefore, it would make sense to react to concerns about both inflation and weak activity. If the Committee were to face that situation, given the low level of the funds rate today, the policy response could involve moderate increases in the funds rate that restrain inflation while continuing to provide some support to the economy.\n\nLet me end where I began. As I said at the outset, a key feature of current monetary policy is the emphasis on communication and transparency. This effort has been ongoing for a long time, and it has intensified over the past year. The reason for the focus on communication is that economic developments are affected by longer-term interest rates, equity values, the exchange rate, and other asset values—and these factors depend not only on the current funds rate, but more importantly on the expected future path of the funds rate. Clear, straightforward language that helps explain to markets and the public what the Fed is looking at, and why, can make policy more effective by fostering the appropriate expectations and decisions. Clear communication can also help avoid financial disruptions when policy enters a new phase. I think that what happened in June is a perfect case in point. It was my first meeting, and the Committee voted to raise rates a quarter point for the first time in three years. Some people asked me afterwards if the discussion at the meeting had been kind of uninteresting, because the outcome had been very well anticipated by market participants. I responded, “On the contrary. I take this as a mark of success of the FOMC’s new strategy.”\n\nI hope that my comments today have done their part to communicate my thinking as a Fed policymaker. Now I’ll be glad to take any questions.\n\n# # #\n\n"

            "content": "\n\nGood morning. It’s always a pleasure and an honor to speak at the NABE annual meeting. The topic this year, of course, is “risks in the economic outlook.” Diane has done an excellent job of discussing your forecasts for 2000 and the risks associated with it. So I’m going to take a somewhat broader view. And I believe this is an especially good time to do this.\n\nAs you know, the last three years have been very good years for the economy. But they haven’t been such great years for a lot of forecasters. Frankly, for much of that time, many of our forecasts predicted that the combination of fast growth, low unemployment, and low inflation was about to end any minute.\n\nAnd it’s easy to understand why. It was natural to assume that there was little change in the structure of the economy. So it also was natural to assume that economic performance would return to historical norms. Over the last three years or so, that left most forecasts centered on a real GDP growth rate of 2 percent or a little higher, which was thought to be the long-run trend. Specifically, the median one-year-ahead forecasts from the Blue Chip survey were 2.1% in January 1996, 2.1% in January 1997, and 2.2% January 1998. But, in fact, the actual rates were almost twice that! At the same time, with the economy growing rapidly and labor markets apparently tight, most forecasts overshot actual inflation in 1997 and 1998. For example, the Blue Chip survey showed CPI inflation of 2.9 and 2.3 percent in 1997 and 1998, respectively, versus actual figures of 1.9 and 1.5 percent.\n\nIn my remarks today, I want to focus on what these forecast errors could be telling us about the current economy. And I’ll also discuss what the errors mean for the conduct of monetary policy.\n\nSo, let me turn to the first issue–what could be going on in the economy that would be consistent with fast output growth, low unemployment, and low inflation? Well, I can point to several special factors that have helped keep inflation down during this period. For example, global financial crises weakened foreign demand. That led to a stronger dollar–and therefore lower import prices–as well as falling commodity prices worldwide and a drop in capacity utilization rates in U.S. manufacturing. In addition, energy prices were falling during 1997 and 1998, and so were the costs of health care, as the industry restructured itself. Finally, there’s a technical point: the CPI is down 1/2 percent or a bit more because of the improvements the Bureau of Labor Statistics has made in measuring prices.\n\nBut beyond these special factors, there’s a more fundamental issue–and that’s the nation’s productivity. Certainly, several developments in the last couple of years suggest that we may be in the midst of a supply shock related to more rapid, and more dispersed, technological change. And that would be consistent with the fast growth, low unemployment, and low inflation we’ve seen. One obvious indicator is that measured productivity growth has picked up–rising to just under 2-1/2 percent on average. This compares to an estimated trend rate of only around 1 to 1-1/2 percent for the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s. Another indicator is the faster growth we’ve seen in real labor compensation. This result is something we’d expect to go along with higher labor productivity. A third indicator is the strength of corporate profits. This also can help explain at least part of the extraordinary rise in stock market values.\n\nAnd it’s easy to see why people would point to technological advances as the source of much of this increase in productivity growth rates. For one thing, we’ve seen very rapid increases in investment in computers and other information processing equipment–since 1995, it has ranged from just under twenty percent a year to over thirty percent a year, in real terms! For another, there are plenty of examples of the difference technology can make–not only in labor-saving devices, but also in changing the way people do business. For example, I saw firsthand how technology could increase the flexibility of production processes when I visited a lumber mill in Oregon. They demonstrated how they used lasers to define the geometry of a log, and they then cut it based on the latest price information for different cuts. If there’s a shortage of two-by-fours, then prices on them rise and the mill cuts more of them and fewer of other sizes.\n\nSuch improvements in production flexibility and real-time information flows illustrate how technology can make a difference for U.S. firms. They can help eliminate bottlenecks, streamline production, and fine-tune specifications so firms can better match–and even anticipate–customers’ needs. And this all could translate into faster productivity growth for the economy.\n\nBut even though there are indicators–and anecdotes galore–suggesting that a productivity shock has been driving the recent performance of the U.S. economy, there also are serious uncertainties–many of them revolving around the productivity data themselves.\n\nFor example, just consider recent productivity numbers. Frankly, they don’t stand out as all that robust when you compare them to recent decades. There are lots of instances–especially early in past business cycle expansions–when the productivity growth rate was much higher than it is now.\n\nAnother issue is where the productivity is showing up in today’s data. Part of it is in the computer industry itself, and thus does not reflect efficiencies that are spreading throughout the economy.\n\nOf course, it’s well-known that the data suffer from some real problems and could be missing much productivity growth. For example, the data don’t measure productivity in the services sector very well, and in some cases not at all. To resolve some of these problems, the GDP accounts are undergoing some major revisions. The new data will be released in October, and they’ll reflect a number of changes, such as beginning to include the measurement of productivity in banking and calculating software as investment spending, rather than simply as a raw material to the production process. As a result, estimates of productivity growth will be higher–though we don’t know by how much. As welcome as these revisions are, however, they’re not a complete solution to the problem of measuring productivity.\n\nMy final points about the uncertainties surrounding productivity are yet more fundamental. One problem is: at this early stage, we can’t tell whether the surge in productivity growth is a cause of the fast output growth–or a consequence of it. And it may be a consequence because, historically, productivity growth has followed a pro-cyclical pattern. So, it’s possible that the recent strength in productivity won’t last very long–it might largely be due to the strong business cycle upswing we’ve been in. In that case, continued strong real GDP growth and tight labor markets eventually would create pressures for inflation to increase.\n\nFurthermore, even if the productivity surge is a cause of the fast output growth, we don’t know how long it will last. I must admit, I found your responses to the survey question on this point pretty interesting. Most of you appear to believe that much of the recent increase in productivity reflects a higher trend rate–which, presumably, means it would be longer-lasting. The survey showed a median estimate of the trend to be 2.0 percent. But while the data admit the possibility of a sustained increase in productivity, I can’t say that I find them convincing by themselves. So, until we have enough data to see the rapid growth sustained for a long time, we won’t know for sure.\n\nThe uncertainty about recent productivity growth appears to be the major uncertainty in the outlook for the U.S. economy, and also for the conduct of monetary policy. For policy, this uncertainty complicates the question of whether FOMC actions should be strongly pre-emptive or more cautious.\n\nIdeally, policy should be pre-emptive because of the long lags between policy actions and their effects on the economy. For example, if policymakers wait until inflation actually begins to pick up steam, they face a problem that was all too familiar in the 1970s and early 1980s. In order to quell inflation, interest rate increases have to be bigger, which means the output losses are bigger, and the employment losses are bigger.\n\nBut, if a central bank reacts early and correctly, it can alter inflation expectations and cut off the rise in inflation before it gets started. It looks like that’s what happened in the U.S. in 1994. At that time, we were dealing with forecasts of higher inflation that were based not only on increasingly tight labor markets but also on low short-term real interest rates. So the Fed responded by raising interest rates substantially. In that case, inflation didn’t take off, and the economy moved smoothly into the favorable conditions we’ve enjoyed in recent years.\n\nBut, suppose there are reasons to doubt the forecasts. Suppose, like now, we’re uncertain about the underlying model of the economy. In that case, pre-emptive policy can lead to the wrong action. When there’s a high degree of uncertainty about forecasts, it could be best for policy to be more cautious–in the extreme, to wait until inflation actually starts to rise before acting to tighten. With high uncertainty about the future, a somewhat delayed action could be preferable to running the risk of tightening when it’s not warranted.\n\nThe appropriate degree of caution depends on an analysis of the risks of the two approaches in any particular circumstance, and it will vary over time. In 1994, there were several key indicators of rising inflation in the future; in addition, there was no major source of uncertainty to make us doubt the normal relationships in the economy.\n\nIn the current situation, we face uncertainty about whether the good news on productivity growth is a cause or a consequence of our current performance–and if it’s a cause, how long it will last. Since most forecasts of output and inflation have been off the mark recently, it makes sense to place less weight on them than we normally have in the past. And the same is true of our interpretation of some of our usual indicators. For example, labor markets have been tight for several years. And the so-called output gap, which compares real GDP with an estimate of its long-run trend, also has suggested rising inflation for a few years. But the possibility of a productivity shock renders these indicators much less reliable. As a result, the Fed has taken a fairly cautious approach in reacting to such indications of a higher future inflation, especially since actual inflation has been so well-behaved.\n\nBut it’s important to make a distinction here. While the Fed has reacted cautiously to signs of building inflationary pressures, that doesn’t mean that the Fed has reacted cautiously to everything. For example, last fall, there was no doubt that the financial crises abroad were putting a strain on U.S. markets, and we lowered rates promptly. So far, this strategy seems to have worked well. Inflation has remained subdued, while the expansion has not only continued for eight years–it has even strengthened!\n\nI’m certainly pleased with the Fed’s contribution to this outstanding economic performance. But I’m also well aware that monetary policy is only part of what’s made the U.S. economy the envy of the world, especially in recent years when we have experienced a technology boom. By moving toward price stability, the Fed has helped to provide a healthy, stable environment for people and businesses to manage their economic affairs. At the same time, sound fiscal and regulatory policies certainly can claim credit for some share of the nation’s economic and financial success.\n\nThese policies provide an environment in which the drivers of America’s productivity and prosperity–hard work, innovation, and entrepreneurship–can flourish."

            "content": "Good morning. I’m delighted to be here today. Frankly, I’m here on a mission–one I share with the other Fed Presidents and members of the Board of Governors in Washington. We want to get information about Y2K and the banking industry out to the public. Of course, I’m sure you all know what the Y2K “bug” is. Some equipment has computer chips that won’t recognize the new century date, because they were designed to run assuming the year began with the number “19,” not the number “20.”\n\nNow, I know my Fed colleagues and I have a reputation either for not saying much, or for not being clear when we do say something. In fact, Chairman Greenspan once said, “If I seem unusually clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said.” But my mission today is to be perfectly clear–both about the impact of the Y2K problem on the U.S. financial system and about the steps being taken to address it.\n\nSo I’m going to touch on four major points: First, what the Fed is doing about Y2K compliance for itself; second, where we stand with the financial institutions we supervise; third, what’s going on in related areas beyond the Fed’s domain; and, finally, what you can do to ensure a smooth transition for yourself as the century rolls over.\n\nAnd I’ve brought with me two experts who’ll help answer some of your questions. Marla Borowski is an Assistant Vice President, and she manages the District Cash Product Office. Bob Johnson also is an Assistant Vice President, and he’s responsible for regional and community supervision of banks and bank holding companies in our District. After my remarks, we’ll all be available to field your questions.\n\nBefore I tell you why I’m confident about the U.S. financial system’s “state of readiness,” let me mention that–as an economist–I deal with probabilities all the time. I think the probabilities are very high that on January 1, 2000, nothing very unusual is going to happen. The financial services you’ve come to rely on–checks, ATMs, debit cards, credit cards, direct payment, and direct deposit, for example–will operate normally.\n\nBut probabilities aren’t certainties. Problems could crop up–just as they could any day of the week, Y2K bug or not. For example, have you ever been watching a close ball game on television, and suddenly your screen goes blank because either the cable went out or the power failed? Or have you gone to the checkout line at your supermarket and found the cashier couldn’t scan your groceries? Things happen. So I wouldn’t be surprised if there were some disruptions here and there. But I want to stress this point: people at the Fed and elsewhere are making good progress–in many cases, excellent progress–not only in resolving the Y2K problem, but also in preparing to deal with any disruptions that may occur.\n\nI’ll start with the Fed’s efforts to get its own house in order. To show you how important addressing the Y2K problem is to us, let me quickly describe our role in the settlement of financial markets. Every day, over two trillion dollars pass through Reserve Bank books. That money represents the settlement of the U.S. government securities market, the eurodollar market, the dollar leg of all other foreign exchange transactions, a wide variety of security and bond markets, and about sixty-six million checks and sixteen million automated clearing house transactions–among other things! Frankly, if the Reserve Bank systems don’t function properly, much of everything else in the U.S. financial system comes to a halt.\n\nSo, what’s the current status? I’d say it’s very good–not just for settlements, but for all the systems that are critical to the Fed’s mission. And the status should be very good, because we’ve been working on this problem for five years. As of June 30, 100 percent of our “mission-critical” systems were classified Y2K compliant, and those systems are in use right now. Yes, the Fed is at 100 percent!\n\nNow, what about the institutions we supervise? The Federal Reserve and the other federal banking agencies have examined every federally insured depository institution in the country for Y2K readiness–not just once, but several times. The banking agencies have set dates for completing all phases of Y2K preparations. These include: making inventories of systems with Y2K problems, developing plans to remediate or replace those systems, implementing and testing Y2K compliant systems, and completing contingency plans. We’ve found that banks are making excellent progress in meeting these milestones. In fact, 99 percent of all federally insured banks, thrifts, and credit unions are making satisfactory progress–which means they’ve received the highest possible rating for readiness. And the few that aren’t ready now are getting our full attention. In addition, we’re requiring banks to assess customer and counter party risk and to take steps to mitigate those risks. And we’re overseeing major service providers and software vendors as well.\n\nNow let’s move beyond the Fed’s domain. This, of course, is a very broad area. It includes everything from securities, insurance, and mutual fund companies to stock exchanges and clearinghouses. It also includes public utilities, such as power, water, transportation, and telecommunications, as well as U.S. government agencies and even the businesses, financial systems, and governments of countries abroad.\n\nI’ll start with the first category–the U.S. financial services industry beyond commercial banks. Their regulators have been working toward Y2K compliance, just as we have. State agencies and the Securities and Exchange Commission have set milestones for renovation and replacement that are similar to ours. And the progress appears to be moving along extremely well. In fact, the SEC has indicated that the securities exchanges and clearinghouses should be compliant well in advance of the new century.\n\nAs for the category of public utilities, it’s being overseen largely by the President’s Council on the Year 2000. The Fed chairs the Workgroup on the Financial Sector. This workgroup stays in constant touch with other sector workgroups to identify problems and clarify priorities. Overall, it looks as if major vendors of utilities will be on track with Y2K compliance. And I’m pleased to note further that recent testing of financial data transfers by a consortium of financial services companies and phone carriers revealed no Year 2000 glitches. As for government services, the systems most directly affecting our financial systems–those in Treasury and Social Security–seem to be in good shape, although some testing with the Fed remains to be done. So far, the test results have been quite positive.\n\nFinally, I’ll turn to the international arena. The Fed is involved in this area through the Joint Year 2000 Council. This is an information clearinghouse on Y2K issues for 170 countries. Governor Roger Ferguson, of the Board of Governors in Washington, is the chairman. And the other members include central bankers, bank supervisors, and insurance and securities regulators.\n\nIn addition, there’s a private sector group known as the Global 2000 Coordinating group. These people are working to coordinate Y2K initiatives in the world financial community. Both the Joint Council and Global 2000 Group have done a lot of work. They’ve assessed the readiness of various markets, conducted surveys, and encouraged readiness in a variety of ways. But neither has regulatory enforcement power, so the uncertainties in this area are higher. To date, the news on this front is quite promising. Evidence from a large test of domestic and cross-border payments in June shows a high level of readiness from more than 500 financial market participants in 19 countries. This test simulated Year 2000 transactions in 34 national and international payment systems, with highly successful results.\n\nNow that I’ve covered the ways we’re trying to prevent problems, let me turn to our plans to deal with problems that do crop up. Even though we expect all payments methods to work, including checks, credit and debit cards, and ATMs, we know that some people still may want to take out extra cash during the changeover. So, as a precautionary measure, we’re going to increase the amount of cash in our vaults, and we’ll also extend the hours of our operation, if necessary. I understand that many banks are doing the same. In addition, Reserve Banks have made it clear that they’ll stand ready to lend, in appropriate circumstances, to depository institutions.\n\nNow, let me just note here that I don’t think it’s a good idea to take a lot of cash out of your bank and put it under your mattress. Why? Because the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation does insure up to one hundred thousand dollars of your money in the bank–but it doesn’t insure your mattress!\n\nMy fourth major point is how you can avoid or minimize any Y2K problems with your own finances. Here are some steps I recommend. First, go for redundancy: back up your financial records, and as they come in, review them carefully for accuracy. Second, check for Y2K readiness: run tests on your own computer, and talk to your bank, your broker, and whoever handles your money to find out the status of their Y2K readiness. Third, security: watch out for scam artists trying to make a quick buck on Y2K fears. Scrutinize Y2K products and services to make sure you really need them and that they’ll work. And guard your personal information, such as bank account numbers, Social Security numbers, and credit card numbers. Finally, rumors and scare stories are likely to increase as we get closer to the new year, so I encourage you to get accurate information and maintain perspective as you sort fact from fiction.\n\nWell, that wraps up this general status report, which was a big part of my “mission” today. The Fed has made communications about Y2K a mission, because public confidence in our financial system is going to be critical during the century date change. Fortunately, we’re seeing evidence that the American public–as usual–has a pretty good grasp of what’s going on. In fact, a July CBS News poll shows that only 8 percent of Americans predict that they will personally face major problems related to the millennium bug. I strongly believe that the more consumers know about Y2K, the more likely they are to take rational precautions and not take drastic steps. To the extent that those survey results reflect trust in the Fed and other institutions charged with safeguarding the financial system in this country, I’d say we’re a lot closer to “mission: accomplished” than to “mission: impossible”! And we at the Fed are prepared to continue to earn that trust as the new millennium approaches and well beyond."

Second, check for Y2K readiness: run tests on your own computer, and talk to your bank, your broker, and whoever handles your money to find out the status of their Y2K readiness. Finally, security: watch out for scam artists trying to make a quick buck on Y2K fears: scrutinize Y2K products and services to make sure you really need them and that they’ll work, and guard your personal information, such as bank account numbers, Social Security numbers, and credit card numbers.\n\nWell, that wraps up this general status report, which was a big part of my “mission” today. The Fed has made communications about Y2K a mission, because public confidence in our financial system is going to be critical during the century date change. Fortunately, we’re seeing evidence that the American public–as usual–has a pretty good grasp of what’s going on.\n\nA Gallup poll in March found that only 9 percent of those surveyed thought they’d have major problems with their finances because of Y2K–that’s down from 14 percent in December. To the extent that those survey results reflect trust in the Fed and other institutions charged with safeguarding the financial system in this country, I’d say we’re a lot closer to “mission: accomplished” than to “mission: impossible”! And we at the Fed are prepared to continue to earn that trust as the new millennium approaches."

            "content": "Good afternoon. I’m honored to be here with you to discuss your opportunities in the financial services industry and the academic paths leading to them. I’m also grateful to the sponsors of today’s symposium for inviting me, so let me say a word of thanks to the Marshall School of Business at USC and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nAs some of you may know, I’m not the first Federal Reserve official to speak publicly on diversity in the financial services industry this year. The first was Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve System. He spoke in January–on Martin Luther King’s 69th birthday–at the first anniversary of Jesse Jackson’s Rainbow-PUSH Coalition/Wall Street Project.\n\nNow, Chairman Greenspan is famous–or, should I say, infamous?–for saying things in a way that sometimes leaves people scratching their heads. In fact, he once said, “If I seem unduly clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said.”\n\nBut last January he was duly and perfectly clear. He said, “Although the image of free market capitalism has been elevated throughout the world…, the application of it within the United States, its largest adherent, is regrettably incomplete. Too many barriers still prevent the free flow of capital and people to their most productive employment.”\n\nIn my own words, let me add that those barriers are all too longstanding, and indeed, all too perilous for our economy and our society. Those barriers–racism, sexism, complacency about the status quo–are destructive, cruel, and wrong. They’re destructive in that they crush individual initiative and cut into our productive capacity. They’re cruel in that they snatch away hope. And they’re wrong in that they betray the moral foundations of our society. At the San Francisco Fed, we’re continuing to work to pull those barriers down. In fact, we’re now working on plans for enhancing our affirmative action program as we approach the year 2000.\n\nBut the focus of today’s discussion isn’t the Fed’s affirmative action program. Instead, the focus is on you–on what kinds of career opportunities are out there for you, and what you can do to prepare for them.\n\nAs a spokesperson for the Federal Reserve, I’ll start by describing what kinds of opportunities our organization can offer. I want to emphasize that the Fed is a publicinstitution, established by the Congress. And though it has a District Bank in the heart of Wall Street, and though it plays a pivotal role in the financial services industry, it’s a far cry from the images you might have seen in movies like “Wall Street,” or “Bonfire of the Vanities.” The Fed is not the world of high-rollers making megadeals, and it’s not the world of Armani suits–as you can clearly see–and it’s certainly not the world of fabulous salaries.\n\nBut what it may lack in glitz and glamor, it makes up for in influence–because one of the main responsibilities of the Fed is setting the nation’s monetary policy. Monetary policy influences all kinds of decisions people and firms make in this country, because it affects the availability of short-term credit in the economy. In the short run, that affects demand and economic output, and in the long run, that affects inflation. So, when you’re making decisions like whether to get a loan to buy a new house or car or to start up a company, whether to expand a business by investing in a new plant or equipment, and whether to put savings in a bank, in bonds, or in the stock market, you’re being influenced by monetary policy.\n\nWho makes the policy? All twelve Federal Reserve Bank Presidents get together with Chairman Greenspan and the other six members of the Board of Governors eight times a year to set policy. In support of that effort, each of the Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors rely on their own staffs of economists. These are mainly people with Ph.D.s in economics who advise policymakers on the economy and who also do basic research–in a sense, this staff is a lot like an economics department in a university or college, except that their work focuses largely on monetary policy.\n\nBut there’s a good deal more to the Fed besides monetary policy. For example, we’re involved in supervising and regulating much of the banking industry. I know Bob Johnson is here from our L.A. Branch to talk to you about that during the seminars. That area includes our Community Affairs Department, which works to ensure compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act and helps develop programs to promote lending to minority businesses and individuals. We also have a whole range of other operations, including the payments system. Every day, the Fed helps keep billions of dollars circulating in the economy through its operations in cash and currency, check-clearing, electronic funds transfer, and even “smart card” technology. By law, the Fed competes with other service providers in this area, and we support that effort with a staff devoted to sales, marketing, and product development. These and other Fed functions are described more fully in the pamphlets we sent here for you. All together, over 2,500 people are employed by the San Francisco Fed and its branches alone–and in the whole nationwide System, including the Board of Governors, there are over 24,000. These employees also include, of course, people who work in human resources, public relations, accounting, financial planning, information technology development and support–we even have webmasters! So you can see that there’s a vast range of types of work to be done in the Fed–in other words, there are job opportunities that are suitable for many career paths.\n\nNow, how do you get going on that career path? Unquestionably, you need a good education–and that’s true not just for the Fed, or for the financial industry, but for anybusiness. I’m pleased to say that the San Francisco Fed is well aware that an education isn’t something that stops after high school, or even after college or graduate school. We have a strong in-house management development program. And we also have a competitive tuition reimbursement program for employees who want to further their education at local colleges or universities.\n\nNow, what do I mean by a “good education”? I don’t mean that you have to focus exclusively on business or finance courses. But I do think a “good education” these days should include a solid grounding in economics. Why? Because economics is basically the study of how markets work–and wherever you’re finally employed, you’re going to need to understand how market economics affects your decisions. Let me give you three examples.\n\nFirst, there’s the overall economic environment in which you and your company operate. This is affected by things like interest rates, exchange rates, tax laws, the unemployment rate, inflation, and so on. For example, suppose you’re deciding whether to build a new plant or open a new office. Your decision will depend in part on interest rates, because you’ll probably be borrowing to finance that expansion. Now suppose you have the option to expand overseas. In that case, you’ll need to understand the implications of exchange rates on your bottom line.\n\nAnother example is the market in which your firm actually competes to sell its product. You’ll need to understand the relationship between supply and demand to price your product correctly. And this applies whether your product is ice cream or investment advice.\n\nFinally, there’s a market within your firm. Some firms are moving in the direction of encouraging their employees to behave like entrepreneurs. In other words, employees aren’t just supposed to wait for orders from the boss–who gets orders from his or her boss–about what do. Instead, they’re expected to figure out what they themselves can do to add value to the company.\n\nThese three examples illustrate the point that you can’t escape the influence of market economics in today’s working world–so you’ll be better off if you know how to use it to your best advantage.\n\nLet me make one final point about the study of economics. It not only teaches us how markets work, it also teaches us about how markets fail to work. For example, if markets were perfectly competitive, race and gender differences–not to mention ethnic and religious differences–wouldn’t have any role to play at all. In other words, we’d never again see discrimination on those grounds. And that would be great for the economy. More competitive markets would mean that all the resources in the economy would be put to their most productive uses.\n\nBut markets aren’t perfectly competitive, and we still see discriminatory practices. What’s behind these market imperfections? Well, some of the most interesting research on the economics of discrimination has pointed to the role of networks–that is, the networks of acquaintances and friends–especially in labor markets. The basic idea is that these networks can act to exclude people. In fact, Kenneth Arrow, a Nobel Laureate in Economics from Stanford University, recently wrote on this point. He argued that because labor markets are especially open to personal interactions, there’s plenty of room for discriminatory beliefs and preferences to play a role.\n\nAlthough much remains to be done in terms of the formal modeling of networks and markets, the basic idea makes intuitive sense to us all. And what’s especially interesting is that the basic idea of networks can be used to work against discrimination as well. Let me give you an example right from the San Francisco Fed. Our employee newsletter recently interviewed Lelia Jones–she’s an African American who just retired from the San Francisco Fed after 32 years. Though she began with us as a secretary, she rose to become Assistant Vice President of Consumer Compliance. What do networks have to do with her story? Well, she felt she faced some discrimination as she progressed in her career. And part of her response was to build a network of mentors, which included her own managers and others in bank management. She credits them with giving her invaluable support and guidance as she struggled to weigh the costs and benefits of overcoming obstacles and capitalizing on opportunities. More important, as her own position improved, Lelia Jones became the nerve center of a network for other women and other minorities who were trying to follow in her path.\n\nI’d like to close this speech by drawing out the two lessons I think we can learn from this admirable woman’s experience.\n\nThese two lessons are by no means a full answer to the problem of discrimination in our society, in our economy, and indeed, in elements of the financial services industry–whether that discrimination is conscious or not. But they do hold the promise of making a difference. And that difference can strengthen the position of women and minorities in the working world of the future.\n\nIt has been a pleasure and an honor to speak to you today. You have all my best wishes for success–in your education today and in your career tomorrow."

            "content": "\n\nI’m truly delighted to be a part of this evening’s awards presentation. Successful partnerships between business and education–such as the ones we’re honoring tonight–are well worth celebrating. I know first-hand–on a number of levels–just how special institutions like City College of San Francisco are to the businesses and people in the communities they serve.\n\nAt the personal level, both my wife, Brenda, and my son, Bob, took advantage of the opportunities of a two-year college by graduating from Pierce College in Los Angeles. Brenda had postponed college to marry me and raise our children, so the convenience of having a campus right in our neighborhood gave her a wonderful chance to pursue her interests in a degree, while she balanced the demands of home and family. For my son, Bob, Pierce was his launching pad into a Bachelor’s program in the U.C. system and a career in computer systems.\n\nAs Chief Executive of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, I’ve long been a supporter of the Bank’s own partnership with City College. For the last six years, we’ve worked together to offer Fed employees a program called “Corporate College.” This program started as an extension of our longstanding commitment to provide tuition assistance to our employees. By having the faculty come to the Bank to conduct the courses, the program gives people a very affordable–and very convenient–way to enrich their business-related skills and knowledge. The program has grown and changed over the years, as more and more people participated in it. Now Fed staffers can complete an Associates degree through the program, and they even can go on to a four-year degree through a similar arrangement we have with San Francisco State and U.C. Berkeley. So far, we’ve had almost 450 people in the program. And, I might add, it also won the Economic Development Network award sponsored by the California State Chancellor’s office in 1995.\n\nI think the San Francisco Fed is an especially appropriate place for a program like this because of the variety of responsibilities we have and the great variety of skills and kinds of knowledge our people need to carry them out.\n\nLet me give you just a few examples. One of our busiest areas is check processing and collection–we handle almost 8 million checks a day in this District. Another is managing and maintaining an electronic wire payments system–again, the numbers seem staggering: our system handles 170 billion dollars a day. We’re also responsible for handling cash distribution in the nine western states–and our employees process and store several billion dollars worth of coin and currency. These banking service functions are, of course, highly automated, and they also require a range of types of employees–from production workers to managers who supervise round-the-clock operations.\n\nIn addition to services such as these, there are also two other broad areas of responsibility: bank supervision and regulation, and national monetary policy. These functions call for a staff with highly specialized training and knowledge. And in both areas, virtually everyone has at least a B.A., and many have masters degrees or higher. Indeed, in our Research Department, which is the main support for monetary policymaking, all of our economists have Ph.D.s and are active in publishing their research in scholarly journals.\n\nThe picture of the Bank I’ve tried to draw is one where ongoing learning is both an opportunity for advancement and a necessity for keeping the institution abreast of unfolding developments. In bank services, these developments may involve learning about or even inventing new technology for such things as high speed currency counting. Or they may involve learning about new management techniques to bring out the best in production employees. In Supervision and Regulation, these developments may involve understanding new strategies for banks to manage risk in their portfolios. In Research, the constant aim is to push at the frontiers of our knowledge about the economy.\n\nThis brings me to the last point I want to discuss. As an economist and monetary policymaker, my focus is on the course of the economy’s growth and its impact on labor markets and on inflation. While there are many disputes when it comes to monetary policy, there is no dispute about how important an educated workforce is both to the Bay Area economy and to the national economy.\n\nLet me illustrate this point about an educated workforce by referring to an analysis of the local economy done last year by the Bay Area Economic Forum. I’m proud to say that the San Francisco Fed contributed substantially to the report. The analysis involved a careful comparison with seven other high-growth regions in the country. One of the strongest findings of the report concerned the role of knowledge-based industries in this economy. It indicated that these industries–software development, high-tech manufacturing, multimedia, and biotechnology, to name just a few–were critical in pulling the local economy out of the long recession of the early 1990s. And they’re an important component of our strong performance today.\n\nLet me review that performance very briefly. Rapid economic growth in the Bay Area since 1995 has pushed employment levels well beyond their previous peak in 1990. And the effect on unemployment has been quite striking, too. The area’s unemployment rate is about 4 percent, around one percentage point lower than a year ago. As the local economic recovery broadened in 1996, we saw employment growth pick up in a number of sectors that are closely linked to a growingpopulation–sectors such as wholesale and retail trade, finance, insurance, and real estate, and state and local government.\n\nThe Bay Area’s strongest sectors–business services and high tech manufacturing–continued to post healthy gains in 1996. For example, job growth in the business services sector is estimated to have jumped 10 percent last year, following a gain of about 15 percent in 1995. Without a doubt, this excellent performance reflects additional jobs developing software for the Internet, multimedia, and other applications. And in high-tech manufacturing, employment activity has increased as well. Many of these firms have been boosting research and development spending in order to stay on the cutting edge of rapidly changing product areas, such as networking equipment. So, clearly, knowledge-intensive industries have been fundamental to our recovery and growing economic strength. And, as the report concludes, they also clearly will be engines of economic growth and prosperity for the region’s future. The rewards for workers who get the education needed to earn a place in such industries can be substantial. Over the last decade or so, there’s been a large increase in the wage premium for workers with higher educational attainment and specific, knowledge-based skills.\n\nBut over this period another development in the marketplace has emerged–both in the Bay Area and in the nation. And this development makes an even stronger argument for the tremendous advantage of ongoing education of the workforce. The development I’m referring to is the high degree of worker displacement we’ve seen. Part of this displacement is due to restructuring in the private sector, as firms strive to improve their efficiency.\n\nBut, there are also other forces–such as regulatory reforms and increased competition from businesses outside regulatory barriers–that have produced large changes, both nationwide and in the Bay Area. For example, among financial businesses, increased competition and automation have led banks and other depository institutions to cut back employment, while securities brokers and other investment offices have continued to add jobs. Deregulation and competition also are fostering some restructuring in the utilities sector.The telephone business is changing rapidly, as local carriers and long-distance companies are beginning to get additional access to each others’ markets. And, as the electric and gas utilities sector also moves towards increased competition, these firms have been forced to ask basic questions about what services they should be providing and what types of workers they need to deliver the services.\n\nThis scenario–of fast-moving developments, regulatory reform, and stiff competition–illustrates how the rules of the game have changed. For the workers of today and tomorrow, it won’t be enough to look for job security under the umbrella of a large corporation. Nor will it be enough to look for it in one small niche of specialized skills. Instead, we’ll have to look for it in ourselves–in strengthening our own ability to adapt, to anticipate change, to grow, and to learn. This is where institutions like City College of San Francisco play such an important role–in building these strengths–and therefore increasing the human capital–of a broad range of citizens in our community."
