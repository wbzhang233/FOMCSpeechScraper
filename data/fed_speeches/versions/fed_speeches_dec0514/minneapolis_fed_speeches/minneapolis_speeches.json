            "content": "Thank you, Governor Bausili. It is an honor to be here with you and Dr. Hernández de Cos from Spain. I have had the pleasure of meeting Governor Bausili a few times this past year when he visited the United States. This is my first visit to Argentina, and I am excited to see the country during this important time and also hope to have opportunities to visit again in the future.\n\nI am going to offer some remarks today about current and future monetary policy in the United States, but I will first briefly touch on some historical context that the audience here may find relevant as you work to bring inflation down in Argentina. Let me start by noting that the comments I offer today are my own views and do not necessarily reflect the views of others in the Federal Reserve System or of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe United States Constitution was ratified in 1788, but it wasn’t until approximately 70 years later, in the 1860s, that the U.S. issued a national currency, the “greenback,” that we are all familiar with today. It was actually President Abraham Lincoln who introduced both the national currency and also federal government debt as mechanisms to finance the Union efforts to fight and win the U.S. Civil War. A saying in the U.S. is that necessity is the mother of invention, and that was certainly true for important economic institutions in the U.S.\n\nWhile the U.S. at that point had both a national currency and federal debt, it still didn’t have a central bank. It wasn’t until the U.S. economy was hammered by banking crises and economic depressions in the late 1800s and early 1900s, including the Panic of 1907, that political consensus finally emerged to establish a central bank, the Federal Reserve, in 1913.\n\nBut a key consideration for politicians was ensuring the different regions of the U.S. were directly represented in the policy process. So, they designed a distributed structure, with the Federal Reserve Board located in Washington, D.C., and 12 independent Federal Reserve Banks spread out around the country. This is similar to the European Central Bank (ECB) today, which consists of the Executive Board located in Frankfurt and individual country banks, whose representatives sit on the Governing Council. I am sure Dr. Hernández de Cos will provide more details about the ECB in his remarks.\n\nThe Minneapolis Fed, which I lead, represents the Ninth Federal Reserve District, which includes the northern central states of Minnesota, North and South Dakota, Montana, part of Michigan and part of Wisconsin. While each of the 12 Reserve Bank presidents represents our individual regions at the Federal Open Market Committee, we each make a recommendation for monetary policy that we believe is best for the United States as a whole.\n\nOne of the most important assets of the Federal Reserve that enables us to be an effective central bank is our credibility with the public, including the American people, whom we are charged to serve, and investors around the world. They have learned that we will do our best to make policy decisions that help us achieve the goals the U.S. Congress has assigned us: stable prices and maximum employment. As I will discuss shortly, the U.S. (and international) experience provides a strong case for central banks to focus on pursuing price stability as a precondition for robust economic performance. Inflation is an unfair tax on incomes, it increases income inequality, and it undermines confidence. When citizens don’t have to worry about inflation, spending and investment decisions are less uncertain, and the financial sector is better able to channel savings to borrowers.\n\nMost importantly, our credibility is supported by the institutional independence of the Federal Reserve from the executive branch of the government. While we are ultimately accountable to the American people through their elected representatives, we are not making policy decisions to benefit any political party or any individual politicians. As I will explain in a moment, this credibility to focus on achieving our economic goals without consideration of politics did not always exist. It took a long time to build, and establishing it came at significant initial economic cost. But once established, this credibility has laid the foundation for economic prosperity for the last four decades in the United States.\n\nIn the 1960s, the U.S. enjoyed a period of low unemployment and generally low inflation. But in the 1970s, when oil prices skyrocketed around the world, the U.S. economy experienced a prolonged period of stagflation. Deep recessions resulted in the unemployment rate moving persistently higher while inflation climbed sixfold, from around 2 percent in the 1960s to almost 12 percent in the 1970s (Figure 1). In an attempt to mitigate output and job losses, the Federal Reserve did not aggressively increase interest rates, partly in response to political pressure from elected officials. The academic consensus agrees that, in doing so, the Fed contributed to a de-anchoring of inflation expectations and increased macroeconomic instability, ultimately undermining its own credibility and effectiveness.\n\nIt wasn’t until President Carter appointed a new Federal Reserve Chair, Paul Volcker, in 1979 that the Federal Reserve turned its primary focus to fighting inflation. Chair Volcker aggressively restrained the growth in money supply, effectively raising rates to about 20 percent and triggering a severe economic contraction and high unemployment. These painful actions, however, paid off. By 1983, inflation had fallen to under 4 percent (Figure 2).\n\nImportantly, President Carter’s successor, President Reagan, who was from the opposing political party, reappointed Chair Volcker, thus endorsing Volcker’s approach to using monetary policy to keep inflation in check. This established a pattern of presidents reappointing Fed chairs who had been appointed by a president of the other party, which has now been repeated many times. This pattern has been instrumental in establishing political support for the Fed as an independent central bank, solely focused on economic goals rather than political ones.\n\nThis independence does not mean the Fed never coordinates with the government. Indeed, in two major crises of the past 20 years, the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 and the COVID-19 crisis of 2020, the Federal Reserve worked closely with the U.S. Treasury Department to design crisis response policies to help reduce damage to the real economy from these shocks. In both cases, the Fed’s coordination with the government did not come at the expense of us trying to meet our inflation and employment goals; rather, coordination was done to help the Fed achieve those goals. Although the sources of those crises were very different, in both cases the U.S. economy faced a weakening economy, a large increase in unemployment and potential deflation. The Fed and the executive branch of government worked together to support the economy and reduce damage from the crises, thus supporting our monetary policy objectives.\n\nAs Figure 3 shows, after the disinflation of the Volcker era, the early 1980s had a rapid decline in inflation, and then inflation was low and more stable for the next 30 years. We saw in the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 that inflation went very briefly negative, but it didn’t lead to a deflationary spiral. In fact, inflation was more or less stable at around our 2 percent target going into the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOf course, restoring jobs and successfully averting deflation was not the final chapter of the impact of COVID on the U.S. economy. The economy recovered quickly, and then the U.S., and most economies around the world, faced an enormous, unexpected increase in inflation, surprising my colleagues and me at the Federal Reserve and most economic forecasters.\n\nWhat caused the high inflation post-COVID? With the benefit of hindsight, the causes are now clear. First, global supply chains for goods were disrupted by the pandemic and took much longer to restore than we had expected. Second, with most of the services side of the economy closed due to COVID, spending was disproportionately directed at the goods sector, which was already facing disrupted supply. Many workers left the labor force due to business closures and were reluctant to return in part because of ongoing potential health risks. Significant fiscal and monetary stimulus had been directed at the economy in anticipation of an extended public health crisis. When highly effective vaccines became widely available much sooner than expected, the need for stimulus was reduced. And then Russia invaded Ukraine, sending a price shock through commodity markets globally. Each of these factors was likely at least somewhat inflationary on its own, but combined, they became highly inflationary for an extended period of time.\n\nWhat caused the fall in inflation? In response to this increase in the inflation, the Federal Reserve, and most central banks around the world, raised rates aggressively to bring inflation down. Historically, such a large increase in the policy rate had often led to recessions, like what happened in the early 1980s. But this time inflation fell while economic growth was sustained (see Figure 4).\n\nHow did this happen? While we are still in the final stages of bringing inflation down to our 2 percent target, it seems clear to me that substantial progress was made in unwinding many of the supply factors that led to an increase in inflation in the first place. Supply chains were eventually restored. The services economy reopened, taking pressure off the goods sector. Workers returned to the labor force and an increase in immigration to the U.S. led to more labor supply. The war in Ukraine, thus far, hasn’t intensified, and commodity markets have stabilized.\n\nWhat role did monetary policy play in bringing inflation down? Tight monetary policy likely reduced demand for goods and services somewhat, thus helping bring inflation down. But reflecting on the mistakes of the 1970s, the most important role monetary policy played was keeping long-run inflation expectations anchored and reinforcing the Federal Reserve’s credibility with the public that we would do what we needed to do to bring inflation down. That confidence was a key factor in achieving what has so far proven to be a remarkably strong labor market, even with rapid disinflation.\n\nFigure 5 provides evidence of this dynamic. It shows headline inflation (in blue) running at 2 percent or just below 2 percent going into COVID, and then experiencing the big run-up and subsequent fall that I just described. The green line is a market indicator of long-run inflation expectations. It’s what markets expect inflation to be for a five-year period, starting five years in the future. And you can see it barely moved during this period. This to me is a demonstration of what central bank credibility looks like, and it makes the FOMC more effective and our job easier. However, we have to do our part to maintain this credibility, and that’s what I believe we did by raising the policy rate rapidly in 2022.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is committed to achieving our dual mandate goals of stable prices and maximum employment. Today, monetary policy remains in an overall restrictive stance, though just how restrictive is unclear to me. The labor market remains strong, and the most recent jobs report is encouraging that a rapid labor weakening does not appear to be imminent. Inflation has come down dramatically from its peak but remains somewhat above our target. As of right now, it appears likely that further modest reductions in our policy rate will be appropriate in the coming quarters to achieve both sides of our mandate. Ultimately, the path ahead for policy will be driven by the actual economic, inflation and labor market data.\n\nI believe there are some key lessons from the U.S. experience that may be relevant to other economies around the world, including Argentina: First, low and stable inflation is a precondition for macroeconomic prosperity. Second, achieving low inflation may require short-term economic pain to both reduce inflation in the short run and to establish institutional credibility so the inflation remains low and in control over the long run. Finally, while the individual reforms will be specific to meet the needs of the individual economy, ultimately the specific institutional structures should be designed as much as possible to endure over a range of economic and political cycles."

The CICD supports tribes through actionable research and community collaboration to further tribal economic prosperity, and also leverages our department’s broader expertise on affordable housing, labor markets, and early childhood development.\nI also should add that the views I express here are not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis or the Federal Reserve System.\nOur work on housing involves applied research, community engagement, and constant attention to economic literature in the field. Our work points to the harmful effects of the current state of housing for Native Americans, Alaska Natives, and other Indigenous populations. My comments and detailed written testimony focus on Indian Country’s specific housing challenges—and on opportunities demonstrated by Indian Country’s leaders.\nHousing is often in short supply and substandard in Indian Country. Homes are seven times more likely to be crowded and nearly four times more likely to lack complete plumbing.1 These conditions have been shown to harm family health and stability. In 2017, HUD estimated that 68,000 units would be needed just to address these issues, which would likely cost tens of billions of dollars.2\nWe focus on five of the factors that reinforce these barriers. First, Native nations are sovereign, but their land is held in trust and must have its title cleared by the U.S. government. Mortgages on trust land are also leasehold mortgages as opposed to fee-simple mortgages. Housing professionals and home buyers frequently identify these realities as significant hurdles.\nSecond, Indian Country home buyers often face an uphill battle working with lenders to finance their home. Our economists’ work shows that Native American borrowers on tribal lands are more likely to receive high-cost loans, leaving them to ultimately pay more for their homes over the life of a mortgage.\nThird, the tools designed to work in Indian Country are underutilized on trust land.

Our research and engagement suggest four recommendations.\nFirst, the federal government should continue to expand the financial capacity of Native community development financial institutions, or Native CDFIs, and other tribal institutions. Native CDFIs offer community-grounded credit solutions in Indian Country. Our research suggests that the presence and activities of Native CDFIs increase the credit score of Indian Country residents that previously had the lowest credit scores. And a pilot involving two Native CDFIs and the USDA in South Dakota has shown the power of connecting community-based lenders and federal lending resources.\nSecond, the federal government can create a normalized and complementary interagency lending process in Indian Country. We recommend that federal agencies and the government-sponsored enterprises work with representatives from tribal governments, lenders, developers, and nonprofits to find solutions and provide guidance for housing in Indian Country.\nThird, an improved title process on trust land would support housing development and tribal sovereignty. The Helping Expedite and Advance Responsible Tribal Home Ownership, or HEARTH, Act of 2012 created a process for tribes to assume additional control of trust land management. Sufficient funding is not available through the HEARTH Act itself to fund the administrative capacity necessary for taking over trust-land management from the BIA, and the cost is simply too high for many tribes.\nFinally, data on Native Americans and Indian Country programs should be improved. With some exceptions, existing sources are often insufficient to assess policy impacts or changes in population-level well-being. Illuminating economic conditions in Indian Country will require collaboration on methodologies and new financial resources to obtain sufficient statistical samples.\nI thank you again for the opportunity to share insights from the CICD’s work, and would also like to thank my staff for their help in preparing these comments. Congress has recently taken steps to support tribal sovereignty and access to important housing resources, and I hope our testimony provides insights into how federal policy can further support and accelerate Indian Country’s upward momentum.\nEndnotes\n1 Nancy G.

            "content": "Opportunity & Inclusive Growth Institute Director Abigail Wozniak spoke with Mary Suiter for the Women in Economics podcast series from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The series highlights the research and careers of women making their marks in the field of economics. Listen to the episode here.\nMary Suiter: Hello. I'm Mary Suiter, and you're listening to the Women in Economics Podcast Series from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Today, I'm speaking with Abigail Wozniak, the director of the Opportunity & Inclusive Growth Institute at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Hi, Abbie. Thank you for joining me today.\nAbigail Wozniak: Hi, Mary. Thanks for inviting me.\nSuiter: Abbie, you earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago and a Ph.D. from Harvard. Why did you choose to study economics?\nWozniak: I first really just decided, I would say is a good word, that I was interested in economics when I was a teenager, and there was a really notable stock market movement that coincided with Michael Jordan returning to the NBA. And I just thought it was incredibly fascinating that something that seemed very disconnected could be affected by really popular sentiment in that way. And then I would say a second thing that happened early on was just really living through a time when the U.S. had a lot of insecurity about really its ability to produce innovations and be an economic leader in the world. And, again, this dates me a little bit, but I used to tell my undergrad students that before there was anxiety or concern about our trading relationship with China, we had similar, in some ways, concern about our trading relationship with Japan. And that was the, the kind of era I experienced growing up, and I saw just a lot of serious thought happening in the U.S. around what could we learn from Japan. There were many things about, that I would say a kind of challenging trading relationship, that also were generating a lot of lessons, and that was exciting to see. So, for me, those kinds of two very different economics events were just things that got me interested in the field as a whole, and you might suppose from those early stories that I went on to become a trade or a macroeconomist, but I didn't. I ultimately decided that labor economics was just really the best space for me, but that's how I got started being interested in the topic.\nSuiter: So I'd like to talk a little bit about your work experience, Abbie. You served on the White House Council of Economic Advisers from 2014 to 2015. You were a tenured associate professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame, and you're the first director of the Opportunity & Inclusive Growth Institute at the Minneapolis Fed. What did you do in your role as a senior economist on the White House Council of Economic Advisers?\nWozniak: So the Council of Economic Advisers, or CEA, really serves as a small to medium-sized think tank devoted to answering questions about the economy that the administration has. And so that makes us pretty different from a lot of the other parts of the executive branch, which range from White House offices of which there are a reasonable number to a large number of federal agencies. Most of the other parts of the executive branch are devoted to executing, to doing things, and making progress on presidential initiatives, and often in cooperation with Congress.\nThe CEA is a little bit different in that it's designed to help reflect on some of those initiatives and then, in some cases, CEA becomes involved in helping to move initiatives forward. We took a lot of time to inform what are called economy and efficiency memos. So whenever folks hear about an executive order, the rationale for those is that they must advance either the economy or the efficiency of procurement in the executive branch. And so thinking about whether a particular executive order could contribute to either of those things was something that was high on the list at CEA during the time that I was there. And that's really just a small example. There really are many, many other ways in which CEA can contribute, but I would say a key piece is, again, that reflecting on the evidence, summarizing the evidence that we can bring to bear from economics, very occasionally even drawing from broader social science disciplines, and trying to help really all of the units throughout the executive branch understand what a nonpartisan group of economists would think about the different actions that they're taking. There are just many of the projects that you might think touch on economic performance, the labor market, innovation. And, again, in the years that I was there, climate change and thinking about the long-run and medium-run costs of climate change, those were all things that CEA got to weigh in on.\nSuiter: Thank you. Going back to your work at Notre Dame, you were an associate professor of economics. What did you do to try to draw women and underrepresented minorities into economics, and what do you think could be done to draw more minorities into the field of economics?\nWozniak: In my time at Notre Dame, I was part of a group called Building Bridges, which was a faculty mentoring group primarily for first-generation college-going students, and the group had a large number of underrepresented minorities as part of that. I was able to interact with a number of different students who were interested in economics. It was a small program on my part, a larger program on the university's part, because faculty would just advise one student per year.\nBut I don't think any students ever left economics, which was exciting. I often tried to talk really hard, really seriously with students about what are they interested in and why are they interested in economics and help students think about whether that choice was best for them. So, as a faculty member, if you want to reach students like that, it can be hard to do that on your own, and so it was really great to be able to connect with the universitywide program that was doing that. And I think it's just important for folks to recognize that that's something that faculty have to voluntarily step up and do and to think about other ways where the rest of the university or college system could be used to help faculty connect with those students.\nSuiter: Thank you. Just as an aside, as a first-generation college student, I think any kind of advice that I could have gotten like that would have been very helpful.\nSo, what are your goals as the director of the Opportunity & Inclusive Growth Institute?\nWozniak: So I describe our goals as twofold, and then there's kind of a third goal that I pull in. And so, let me back up a little bit and say that the Institute has as its mission to conduct and promote research that will further opportunity and economic inclusion. So at the heart of our objective is research, and we really aim to be a research institution that's connecting with frontier-style, academic, cutting-edge research and that's also producing that research ourselves. But I describe our goals as working to meet that mission statement in two ways. The mission statement is big and important, but it raises questions of, well, how exactly are we going to do that? We know we have a research focus, but beyond that, what are our concrete steps?\nSo the first goal is to really grow the research community that the Federal Reserve has access to, and the Institute is working to be a resource for folks throughout the Federal Reserve system, but we live in Minneapolis. So our first goal is just really, again, broaden that research community that the Fed can connect to. The Fed has had really strong relationships with researchers who I describe as focusing on core central banking topics, so macro, exchange rates, sovereign debt, finance. Those are all places where, if the Fed needs to understand or connect with or get a question answered from a cutting-edge research individual, we can reach out to anyone in that space, and we often have tight connections with them already. They certainly know about us and will be willing to share wisdom as they can.\nThat's just a little bit less true in other spaces that I would argue feed more into the definition of full employment and, in particular, really the description of full employment. What does it mean to be fully utilizing our resources on the employment front? That's a really hard question to answer. It's become more challenging over time as some forces pulling in different directions in the economy have developed, and it means that we just need a lot more in the way of connections to folks who can really tell us how the economy functions for the full spectrum of Americans. And we've long had, in the Federal Reserve System, folks who work on questions like poverty, folks who work on questions like inequality, intergenerational transmission of wealth. We have those folks in the System, but the Institute can help give them a focus, and it can help really jumpstart the broader research connections by connecting to folks outside the Fed System on those topic areas. And, one way we do that is we have an interdisciplinary board of advisors at the Institute. So experts broadly on economic inclusion and opportunity from a range of social science disciplines connect with us through our advisory board. So that first piece is let's grow the research community that the Fed has access to so that we can be better informed about how the economy is really working for everyone and move a bit more into that depth and richness of understanding what's happening in the economy.\nThe second goal that we have is then to share some of those research insights. A lot of what we learn when we start to ask how can the U.S. better utilize all of the resources that we have in our workforce, a lot of what we learn is that policies and programs can contribute to that, but they aren't things that the Fed itself can control. It's really incumbent upon us, in terms of using our research resources wisely, to share out what we are learning when we connect with those experts, and so we have a really big effort going right now to try to be more communicative and share research findings, both just getting great papers from folks and posting those, but going well beyond that to translate the implications of that work for a broader audience, including policymakers. Those two goals to meet our mission statement are really connected with a broader group of folks who can give us a richer picture of how the economy works for everyone. And then the second piece is to take lessons from that and share them broadly so that, even if we aren't the individuals, as the Fed, that can institute policies that will enhance economic inclusion, then other policymakers can pick them up.\nI just want to add one thing, which is this third goal that I mentioned. As a new entity, [the Institute] really has an amazing opportunity to model for the economics profession what an inclusive, scholarly environment looks like and so, when we are doing our work, I'm always thinking about how can we do this work in an inclusive way. And we've made some efforts on that dimension thinking really hard about our hiring and being, keeping that top of mind as we bring on new folks and build out the Institute, but we're also thinking hard about just our interactions with one another. How can we include scholars who work in different disciplines and hear what they have to say in a way that's productive? So all of that is, I think, really a third goal that we have at the Institute, even though it's not necessarily something specific that comes out of our mission. I think how we achieve that mission is important too, and so working toward that is something that's very much part of what we're doing at the Institute.\nSuiter: So you've been a visiting scholar at the University of Chicago's Becker Friedman Institute, a visiting fellow with Princeton University's Department of Economics and Industrial Relations, and a faculty research fellow at the National Bureau of Economic Research. Currently, you're a research fellow at the Institute of the Study of Labor and an affiliate of the Upjohn Institute. What does your work as a visiting scholar and research fellow entail?\nWozniak: That can vary, again, a lot from institution to institution. To kind of summarize the different experiences that I've had, most of the research affiliate or research fellow relationships involve spending time at that institution and/or spending time at that institution's events and then, also, it usually offers some kind of opportunity to distribute your work in a working paper environment. So those can all be really useful. I think we often underestimate, or when we tell students about being professional economists, I think we often forget to tell them about how important it is to build your own community of scholars throughout the profession, and many folks come to this over time. They realize the importance of that and create networks that work for them, but I think it's important to let students know that there are these wider communities.\nAnd often scholarship gets a reputation as a very solitary activity and, in economics, that, I would say, is really not the case anymore, if it ever was. I think of economists as very interested in engaging in debate and discussion with one another, and so I can't imagine, frankly, the profession ever feeling very solitary.\nSuiter: With the Women in Economics Podcast Series, but also with our symposium, we really try to encourage young women to think about building their networks as undergrads and as they go on to graduate school, if they go on to graduate school, because it's so important to have that relationship with people to help you with your work, to help inform your work, for you to help inform others. So, thank you for sharing that.\nYou also serve as associate editor of the journal Economic Inquiry.\nWe often hear [about] the difficulties that women and underrepresented minorities have in publishing their work. What advice do you have for young women who may be beginning their research work?\nWozniak: First, my advice to all graduate students is to work on things that they're interested in. I always put that out there. I think the case for working on what you're really interested in is that that provides you the energy to keep going when you are facing rejection or challenges or the data gets stuck or the model isn't working out. If you are genuinely, deeply committed to the question, it will be something that pulls you through some of those more difficult periods. And so I think being committed to that is important.\nI do think that working on professional networks continues to be important for the profession, and I know this is frustrating for a lot of people. The feeling is that peer review should be completely unbiased, and if you hear someone say something like your network might be important, that seems to be a recognition that the process is not unbiased. I would say—and this—this reflects a bit on my time as a, kind of, co-editor and associate editor: The process for publication is run by humans, and it's run largely by volunteers. We often omit that part, but people do not get paid to write referee reports, and very few people get paid anything appreciable to be journal editors. They often receive some professional recognition for that, and that's important. But, you know, we don't entrust our very most important things to volunteer efforts. So I think it's worth recognizing that this is just a human, volunteer-run institution. And so it's going to have some significant imperfections in it. That's not to excuse bias, but I think it's important for people to recognize that that's the way the system works. So it's just that it's this human, volunteer-run effort.\nSo, in that environment, it is important to make sure that you're talking to lots of folks. You're refining your research in advance of sending it to journals. You are trying your very hardest to have the highest quality paper that you can before sending it to journals. I know many folks, and I can lapse into this myself too, who kind of feel like they know there's maybe some questions about whether to do things one way or do them another way, and they figure they'll let the reviewers tell them what they want to hear. Try to avoid that. Try to get those pieces done before you send it out because you're not going to be able to count on those folks to just give you constructive feedback that you can then take action on. That is more likely to turn into a rejection. I think that that advice is be really interested in what you're in, but recognize the kind of flawed nature of the publishing institution. And I think one way to combat that is really to use your peers and your network to hone your research but then, at the same time, be building out those connections so that you'll have, kind of, wider recognition and a better chance in that process.\nSuiter: That takes us back to the role of networking and the value of having peers who inform your work. It also seems to me that, perhaps, building that network may offer you an opportunity to actually, at some point in your career, perhaps participate in the editorial process yourself.\nWozniak: Right. And so, I want to say, just let me add a couple of things on there and, actually, this might bring us to some questions about econjobmarket.org as well, which I've been involved with. Building networks continues to be important, but it's incumbent upon people who have strong positions in those networks now to make sure that they are doing work to make those networks more inclusive. Some folks advocate for turning away from the importance of networks and trying to develop systems that are meeting some ideal of meritocracy, that avoids these human interactions. I think that's going to be very difficult.\nI think it's important to recognize that human interactions are part of this human endeavor that we have called knowledge production in science, and we need to think harder about whether those structures and networks that we're building are inclusive. So folks who are generating seminar series and issuing seminar series invitations, thinking really hard how many women, how many underrepresented minorities, how many folks from different backgrounds have you had present in your series? Is there a way that you can make those series more inclusive? One thing we're trying to do at the Institute is create an expectation that people can either present a very polished piece of work or they can present a work in progress and get more feedback, and we are trying to communicate to our seminar audience you might get one, but you might get the other.\nIt can be very intimidating to folks to present in an environment where you're expected to have a paper that's basically already accepted at a top-five journal, and you're just playing the hits for folks, so to speak. That is a model of seminar that I have been in many times in different institutions. I think it's fine to have those. We all want to see great papers. I love to hear about them from the authors, but we also need to create space for folks who are younger or who don't have that paper nailed down yet to get constructive feedback on their work. So that's just one suggestion is paying attention to who is coming to your seminars as invitees and then thinking about how you can push that seminar culture to allow for a broader set of works in progress.\nI think there are definitely other things we can continue to do. Kind of the last one I'll mention is I would like to see journals open up applications for associate and assistant editors and even editors-in-chief. We could allow folks to volunteer and nominate others for that, and that might improve representation more rapidly than the pace we've been seeing.\nSuiter: That really does seem like a great suggestion. And your other suggestions about seminars, that seems to tie back to your third goal that you mentioned about building inclusive environments yourself at the Institute, and what you learn there in building those environments might inform people doing seminars and other things and how they go about being more inclusive. You serve on the board of econjobmarket.org. Could you talk about what that is and what you do as a board member?\nWozniak: Sure. So the first thing I want to say is that econjobmarket.org is not a job market site that trades in rumors about the economics profession. There is a similarly named anonymous website, and that is not what econjobmarket.org is.\nSuiter: Thank you for clarifying that.\nWozniak: So, basically, it's a site where folks looking for Ph.D. economists can post jobs, and then people can submit their materials and apply to those jobs. What got me on the board of EJM was that, a couple of years ago, there was a lot of concern about information in the profession going through that rumor site that I mentioned, and there was a study by an undergraduate at the time, Alice Wu at Berkeley, that used text analysis to uncover really extensive misogynist language on that rumors site. And this was problematic on the job search front because the rumors site had become a place where a lot of people went to try to find out how their application was progressing. So they couldn't find out, for example, \"Hey, has UT-Austin read my packet?\" but they could find out on that rumors site, “Hey, is UT-Austin scheduling interviews with people already and they just haven't called me?\" So folks were drawn to that site to try to get information, up‑to‑date information, about where different schools and employers were in their hiring process, but to get that, they were wading through extremely toxic stuff. And I always told my students, \"Don't look at the site. It's not going to tell you anything that is actionable for you. You know, either they've called you or they haven't. It doesn't matter, and you're just going to see terrible stuff.\" That was just really hard for many students. It's just so tempting to want that information and that update.\nSo, with my colleague at Notre Dame at the time, Kasey Buckles, we started on Twitter an effort to get departments to just tweet out when they were making calls and where they were in the hiring process, and that was valuable because on Twitter, departments could reveal who they were. You knew it wasn't anonymous information, and it was reasonably accessible to folks. So this was a workaround to try to push people away from the rumors site. EJM was willing to pick this up and program it into their system right away, and they did that even the same job market season that we proposed this Twitter approach [@EconJobMarket]. So they were the first to really make it transparent where employers were in that hiring process. The AEA has also adopted something like this and created a site where students who are looking for jobs can go and consult and see where that employer is in the process. So that's what got me started on EJM is just their willingness to be creative and try to help solve problems in the labor market for Ph.D. economists.\nSuiter: Your research has examined migration between states and cities, the impact of college education on geographic mobility and on health, and employer compensation and screening policies. What drew you to these particular topics?\nWozniak: I think, for me, what pulls together these topics is really major transitions that are incredibly important to individuals. So one of the things that drew me into labor economics versus some of the other economic phenomena that I found really interesting at the beginning was just the centrality of work in people's lives and how important it is to them on so many levels, not just on the livelihood level, but on the level of identity, on the level of meaning, on the level of community. And, these are all harder things for economists to study, but that kind of focus on, OK, how do folks choose this path for themselves and what are the steps that make it happen? That is the bigger set of questions that I think links up a lot of the projects that I've worked on.\nSo migration is really interesting because it's a major event in people's lives. I think folks remember all of them. I had a conversation with a cousin. I knew she had moved a lot as a kid, but she told me she had moved 17 times. And she obviously remembers every one of those and has counted them up.\nSo, even if you're moving a lot, it's something that, nevertheless, is really, really important to people. Whereas, you know, other choices they make tend to recede into the background or they forget them. So thinking about what determines whether someone makes that kind of move, what does it accomplish for them, how do they make that decision, those are all things that I find really interesting, and as we think about migration as a way for folks to really reach a better community that works better for them or strengthen their economic position or the opportunities that their children have, I think it's just, it continues to be incredibly interesting to me to think about why and how people make that decision and when does it work out for them and when could we have policies to support this and make it better. So all of those things, kind of, draw me to that question.\nThe same thing with the employment, I would call it, moment. So this is a really important black box in the labor market that sometimes I dip into, and I hope other folks will work on more as well. It's just that that moment of hiring, what goes into that? What pieces of information are employers using? What pieces of information are job applicants and workers using? All of our statistics just look at folks in terms of, like, they're employed or they're not employed, and what we're missing is that really important handshake or transition piece that I think holds a lot of information about who gets into the labor market, what are the challenges to getting in, how can we preserve jobs, where are jobs, when is it important for transitions to take place to promote mobility or flexibility in the labor market. Those are all questions that connect through that particular transition from being not in one job to in that job, and I find all of those related questions really interesting too.\nSuiter: This reiterates your comments earlier about studying what you're interested in and what you're passionate about and, clearly, you're passionate about these things. But they're also important ideas that can inform policy, and that brings great value to the research as well. It's research that can be used to help us make better decisions about policy related to things like people moving for jobs and people attending college and making that final decision about who you hire and things like that. Thank you for that work.\nWozniak: Thank you.\nSuiter: What challenges have you faced as a woman in economics, and how have you overcome them?\nWozniak: I don't know that I am going to point right now to very specific challenges. I think what I'd rather point to is I do feel that the last several years, from the onset of the #MeToo activism, because we know that #MeToo movement was started even before we saw large waves and significant waves of activism and stories around it. I would say, since the onset of that time, I've really come to look at my experience professionally somewhat differently from how I did before and that, I think, is important for us to recognize as a profession how little progress we had made on some things.\nI would say, before those events, I was a, kind of, incremental progress person, and I felt like, generation after generation, we were plugging away, and there were fewer departments who didn't have full professors who were women. And there were fewer women who felt they couldn't have families or pursue significant outside interests. That was diminishing very slowly over time, and I think those events just really forced a reckoning and a recognition that some of that incremental progress, there was no need for it really to be quite so slow. And when we looked at the economics profession in particular, the track record was unimpressive. I look at our profession, and I think we don't compare very well to other professions that are mathematically demanding. I hate that we even fell back on that. That was often a, kind of, claim, and I would say, frankly, it's one that I probably bought into myself. Again, prior to those events was just this kind of conception that women were somewhat less interested in topics that had a lot of mathematical components to them. Over time, I thought, we're surely going to chip away at this, but it'll take a long time. And, I think, after those events, I just recognized those are stories we were telling ourselves to rationalize a real lack of progress.\nI've really just changed how I look at the profession and my place in it over the last couple of years. I'm just hopeful because, although I'm not articulate on what these solutions look like and progress is not going to happen overnight, I do feel that we're having conversations that we would just never have had even a few years ago. I'm hopeful that that will lead to real change in the norm. It remains to be seen whether this lasts.\nSo we'll see, but I'm optimistic because I do think we're thinking about things in a way that we weren't even just a handful of years ago.\nSuiter: Thank you. That makes me optimistic as well that those conversations will happen and, perhaps, those conversations will bring about some lasting change.\nAbbie, thank you so much for spending time today to tell us your story and share your wisdom.

The series highlights the research and careers of women making their marks in the field of economics. Listen to the episode here.\n\nMary Suiter: Hello. I'm Mary Suiter, and you're listening to the Women in Economics Podcast Series from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Today, I'm speaking with Abigail Wozniak, the director of the Opportunity & Inclusive Growth Institute at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Hi, Abbie. Thank you for joining me today.\n\nAbigail Wozniak: Hi, Mary. Thanks for inviting me.\n\nSuiter: Abbie, you earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago and a Ph.D. from Harvard. Why did you choose to study economics?\n\nWozniak: I first really just decided, I would say is a good word, that I was interested in economics when I was a teenager, and there was a really notable stock market movement that coincided with Michael Jordan returning to the NBA. And I just thought it was incredibly fascinating that something that seemed very disconnected could be affected by really popular sentiment in that way. And then I would say a second thing that happened early on was just really living through a time when the U.S. had a lot of insecurity about really its ability to produce innovations and be an economic leader in the world. And, again, this dates me a little bit, but I used to tell my undergrad students that before there was anxiety or concern about our trading relationship with China, we had similar, in some ways, concern about our trading relationship with Japan. And that was the, the kind of era I experienced growing up, and I saw just a lot of serious thought happening in the U.S. around what could we learn from Japan. There were many things about, that I would say a kind of challenging trading relationship, that also were generating a lot of lessons, and that was exciting to see. So, for me, those kinds of two very different economics events were just things that got me interested in the field as a whole, and you might suppose from those early stories that I went on to become a trade or a macroeconomist, but I didn't. I ultimately decided that labor economics was just really the best space for me, but that's how I got started being interested in the topic.\n\nSuiter: So I'd like to talk a little bit about your work experience, Abbie. You served on the White House Council of Economic Advisers from 2014 to 2015. You were a tenured associate professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame, and you're the first director of the Opportunity & Inclusive Growth Institute at the Minneapolis Fed. What did you do in your role as a senior economist on the White House Council of Economic Advisers?\n\nWozniak: So the Council of Economic Advisers, or CEA, really serves as a small to medium-sized think tank devoted to answering questions about the economy that the administration has. And so that makes us pretty different from a lot of the other parts of the executive branch, which range from White House offices of which there are a reasonable number to a large number of federal agencies. Most of the other parts of the executive branch are devoted to executing, to doing things, and making progress on presidential initiatives, and often in cooperation with Congress.\n\nThe CEA is a little bit different in that it's designed to help reflect on some of those initiatives and then, in some cases, CEA becomes involved in helping to move initiatives forward. We took a lot of time to inform what are called economy and efficiency memos. So whenever folks hear about an executive order, the rationale for those is that they must advance either the economy or the efficiency of procurement in the executive branch. And so thinking about whether a particular executive order could contribute to either of those things was something that was high on the list at CEA during the time that I was there. And that's really just a small example. There really are many, many other ways in which CEA can contribute, but I would say a key piece is, again, that reflecting on the evidence, summarizing the evidence that we can bring to bear from economics, very occasionally even drawing from broader social science disciplines, and trying to help really all of the units throughout the executive branch understand what a nonpartisan group of economists would think about the different actions that they're taking. There are just many of the projects that you might think touch on economic performance, the labor market, innovation. And, again, in the years that I was there, climate change and thinking about the long-run and medium-run costs of climate change, those were all things that CEA got to weigh in on.\n\nSuiter: Thank you. Going back to your work at Notre Dame, you were an associate professor of economics. What did you do to try to draw women and underrepresented minorities into economics, and what do you think could be done to draw more minorities into the field of economics?\n\nWozniak: In my time at Notre Dame, I was part of a group called Building Bridges, which was a faculty mentoring group primarily for first-generation college-going students, and the group had a large number of underrepresented minorities as part of that. I was able to interact with a number of different students who were interested in economics. It was a small program on my part, a larger program on the university's part, because faculty would just advise one student per year.\n\nBut I don't think any students ever left economics, which was exciting. I often tried to talk really hard, really seriously with students about what are they interested in and why are they interested in economics and help students think about whether that choice was best for them. So, as a faculty member, if you want to reach students like that, it can be hard to do that on your own, and so it was really great to be able to connect with the universitywide program that was doing that. And I think it's just important for folks to recognize that that's something that faculty have to voluntarily step up and do and to think about other ways where the rest of the university or college system could be used to help faculty connect with those students.\n\nSuiter: Thank you. Just as an aside, as a first-generation college student, I think any kind of advice that I could have gotten like that would have been very helpful.\n\nSo, what are your goals as the director of the Opportunity & Inclusive Growth Institute?\n\nWozniak: So I describe our goals as twofold, and then there's kind of a third goal that I pull in. And so, let me back up a little bit and say that the Institute has as its mission to conduct and promote research that will further opportunity and economic inclusion. So at the heart of our objective is research, and we really aim to be a research institution that's connecting with frontier-style, academic, cutting-edge research and that's also producing that research ourselves. But I describe our goals as working to meet that mission statement in two ways. The mission statement is big and important, but it raises questions of, well, how exactly are we going to do that? We know we have a research focus, but beyond that, what are our concrete steps?\n\nSo the first goal is to really grow the research community that the Federal Reserve has access to, and the Institute is working to be a resource for folks throughout the Federal Reserve system, but we live in Minneapolis. So our first goal is just really, again, broaden that research community that the Fed can connect to. The Fed has had really strong relationships with researchers who I describe as focusing on core central banking topics, so macro, exchange rates, sovereign debt, finance. Those are all places where, if the Fed needs to understand or connect with or get a question answered from a cutting-edge research individual, we can reach out to anyone in that space, and we often have tight connections with them already. They certainly know about us and will be willing to share wisdom as they can.\n\nThat's just a little bit less true in other spaces that I would argue feed more into the definition of full employment and, in particular, really the description of full employment. What does it mean to be fully utilizing our resources on the employment front? That's a really hard question to answer. It's become more challenging over time as some forces pulling in different directions in the economy have developed, and it means that we just need a lot more in the way of connections to folks who can really tell us how the economy functions for the full spectrum of Americans. And we've long had, in the Federal Reserve System, folks who work on questions like poverty, folks who work on questions like inequality, intergenerational transmission of wealth. We have those folks in the System, but the Institute can help give them a focus, and it can help really jumpstart the broader research connections by connecting to folks outside the Fed System on those topic areas. And, one way we do that is we have an interdisciplinary board of advisors at the Institute. So experts broadly on economic inclusion and opportunity from a range of social science disciplines connect with us through our advisory board. So that first piece is let's grow the research community that the Fed has access to so that we can be better informed about how the economy is really working for everyone and move a bit more into that depth and richness of understanding what's happening in the economy.\n\nThe second goal that we have is then to share some of those research insights. A lot of what we learn when we start to ask how can the U.S. better utilize all of the resources that we have in our workforce, a lot of what we learn is that policies and programs can contribute to that, but they aren't things that the Fed itself can control. It's really incumbent upon us, in terms of using our research resources wisely, to share out what we are learning when we connect with those experts, and so we have a really big effort going right now to try to be more communicative and share research findings, both just getting great papers from folks and posting those, but going well beyond that to translate the implications of that work for a broader audience, including policymakers. Those two goals to meet our mission statement are really connected with a broader group of folks who can give us a richer picture of how the economy works for everyone. And then the second piece is to take lessons from that and share them broadly so that, even if we aren't the individuals, as the Fed, that can institute policies that will enhance economic inclusion, then other policymakers can pick them up.\n\nI just want to add one thing, which is this third goal that I mentioned. As a new entity, [the Institute] really has an amazing opportunity to model for the economics profession what an inclusive, scholarly environment looks like and so, when we are doing our work, I'm always thinking about how can we do this work in an inclusive way. And we've made some efforts on that dimension thinking really hard about our hiring and being, keeping that top of mind as we bring on new folks and build out the Institute, but we're also thinking hard about just our interactions with one another. How can we include scholars who work in different disciplines and hear what they have to say in a way that's productive? So all of that is, I think, really a third goal that we have at the Institute, even though it's not necessarily something specific that comes out of our mission. I think how we achieve that mission is important too, and so working toward that is something that's very much part of what we're doing at the Institute.\n\nSuiter: So you've been a visiting scholar at the University of Chicago's Becker Friedman Institute, a visiting fellow with Princeton University's Department of Economics and Industrial Relations, and a faculty research fellow at the National Bureau of Economic Research. Currently, you're a research fellow at the Institute of the Study of Labor and an affiliate of the Upjohn Institute. What does your work as a visiting scholar and research fellow entail?\n\nWozniak: That can vary, again, a lot from institution to institution. To kind of summarize the different experiences that I've had, most of the research affiliate or research fellow relationships involve spending time at that institution and/or spending time at that institution's events and then, also, it usually offers some kind of opportunity to distribute your work in a working paper environment. So those can all be really useful. I think we often underestimate, or when we tell students about being professional economists, I think we often forget to tell them about how important it is to build your own community of scholars throughout the profession, and many folks come to this over time. They realize the importance of that and create networks that work for them, but I think it's important to let students know that there are these wider communities.\n\nAnd often scholarship gets a reputation as a very solitary activity and, in economics, that, I would say, is really not the case anymore, if it ever was. I think of economists as very interested in engaging in debate and discussion with one another, and so I can't imagine, frankly, the profession ever feeling very solitary.\n\nSuiter: With the Women in Economics Podcast Series, but also with our symposium, we really try to encourage young women to think about building their networks as undergrads and as they go on to graduate school, if they go on to graduate school, because it's so important to have that relationship with people to help you with your work, to help inform your work, for you to help inform others. So, thank you for sharing that.\n\nYou also serve as associate editor of the journal Economic Inquiry.\n\nWe often hear [about] the difficulties that women and underrepresented minorities have in publishing their work. What advice do you have for young women who may be beginning their research work?\n\nWozniak: First, my advice to all graduate students is to work on things that they're interested in. I always put that out there. I think the case for working on what you're really interested in is that that provides you the energy to keep going when you are facing rejection or challenges or the data gets stuck or the model isn't working out. If you are genuinely, deeply committed to the question, it will be something that pulls you through some of those more difficult periods. And so I think being committed to that is important.\n\nI do think that working on professional networks continues to be important for the profession, and I know this is frustrating for a lot of people. The feeling is that peer review should be completely unbiased, and if you hear someone say something like your network might be important, that seems to be a recognition that the process is not unbiased. I would say—and this—this reflects a bit on my time as a, kind of, co-editor and associate editor: The process for publication is run by humans, and it's run largely by volunteers. We often omit that part, but people do not get paid to write referee reports, and very few people get paid anything appreciable to be journal editors. They often receive some professional recognition for that, and that's important. But, you know, we don't entrust our very most important things to volunteer efforts. So I think it's worth recognizing that this is just a human, volunteer-run institution. And so it's going to have some significant imperfections in it. That's not to excuse bias, but I think it's important for people to recognize that that's the way the system works. So it's just that it's this human, volunteer-run effort.\n\nSo, in that environment, it is important to make sure that you're talking to lots of folks. You're refining your research in advance of sending it to journals. You are trying your very hardest to have the highest quality paper that you can before sending it to journals. I know many folks, and I can lapse into this myself too, who kind of feel like they know there's maybe some questions about whether to do things one way or do them another way, and they figure they'll let the reviewers tell them what they want to hear. Try to avoid that. Try to get those pieces done before you send it out because you're not going to be able to count on those folks to just give you constructive feedback that you can then take action on. That is more likely to turn into a rejection. I think that that advice is be really interested in what you're in, but recognize the kind of flawed nature of the publishing institution. And I think one way to combat that is really to use your peers and your network to hone your research but then, at the same time, be building out those connections so that you'll have, kind of, wider recognition and a better chance in that process.\n\nSuiter: That takes us back to the role of networking and the value of having peers who inform your work. It also seems to me that, perhaps, building that network may offer you an opportunity to actually, at some point in your career, perhaps participate in the editorial process yourself.\n\nWozniak: Right. And so, I want to say, just let me add a couple of things on there and, actually, this might bring us to some questions about econjobmarket.org as well, which I've been involved with. Building networks continues to be important, but it's incumbent upon people who have strong positions in those networks now to make sure that they are doing work to make those networks more inclusive. Some folks advocate for turning away from the importance of networks and trying to develop systems that are meeting some ideal of meritocracy, that avoids these human interactions. I think that's going to be very difficult.\n\nI think it's important to recognize that human interactions are part of this human endeavor that we have called knowledge production in science, and we need to think harder about whether those structures and networks that we're building are inclusive. So folks who are generating seminar series and issuing seminar series invitations, thinking really hard how many women, how many underrepresented minorities, how many folks from different backgrounds have you had present in your series? Is there a way that you can make those series more inclusive? One thing we're trying to do at the Institute is create an expectation that people can either present a very polished piece of work or they can present a work in progress and get more feedback, and we are trying to communicate to our seminar audience you might get one, but you might get the other.\n\nIt can be very intimidating to folks to present in an environment where you're expected to have a paper that's basically already accepted at a top-five journal, and you're just playing the hits for folks, so to speak. That is a model of seminar that I have been in many times in different institutions. I think it's fine to have those. We all want to see great papers. I love to hear about them from the authors, but we also need to create space for folks who are younger or who don't have that paper nailed down yet to get constructive feedback on their work. So that's just one suggestion is paying attention to who is coming to your seminars as invitees and then thinking about how you can push that seminar culture to allow for a broader set of works in progress.\n\nI think there are definitely other things we can continue to do. Kind of the last one I'll mention is I would like to see journals open up applications for associate and assistant editors and even editors-in-chief. We could allow folks to volunteer and nominate others for that, and that might improve representation more rapidly than the pace we've been seeing.\n\nSuiter: That really does seem like a great suggestion. And your other suggestions about seminars, that seems to tie back to your third goal that you mentioned about building inclusive environments yourself at the Institute, and what you learn there in building those environments might inform people doing seminars and other things and how they go about being more inclusive. You serve on the board of econjobmarket.org. Could you talk about what that is and what you do as a board member?\n\nWozniak: Sure. So the first thing I want to say is that econjobmarket.org is not a job market site that trades in rumors about the economics profession. There is a similarly named anonymous website, and that is not what econjobmarket.org is.\n\nSuiter: Thank you for clarifying that.\n\nWozniak: So, basically, it's a site where folks looking for Ph.D. economists can post jobs, and then people can submit their materials and apply to those jobs. What got me on the board of EJM was that, a couple of years ago, there was a lot of concern about information in the profession going through that rumor site that I mentioned, and there was a study by an undergraduate at the time, Alice Wu at Berkeley, that used text analysis to uncover really extensive misogynist language on that rumors site. And this was problematic on the job search front because the rumors site had become a place where a lot of people went to try to find out how their application was progressing. So they couldn't find out, for example, \"Hey, has UT-Austin read my packet?\" but they could find out on that rumors site, “Hey, is UT-Austin scheduling interviews with people already and they just haven't called me?\" So folks were drawn to that site to try to get information, up‑to‑date information, about where different schools and employers were in their hiring process, but to get that, they were wading through extremely toxic stuff. And I always told my students, \"Don't look at the site. It's not going to tell you anything that is actionable for you. You know, either they've called you or they haven't. It doesn't matter, and you're just going to see terrible stuff.\" That was just really hard for many students. It's just so tempting to want that information and that update.\n\nSo, with my colleague at Notre Dame at the time, Kasey Buckles, we started on Twitter an effort to get departments to just tweet out when they were making calls and where they were in the hiring process, and that was valuable because on Twitter, departments could reveal who they were. You knew it wasn't anonymous information, and it was reasonably accessible to folks. So this was a workaround to try to push people away from the rumors site. EJM was willing to pick this up and program it into their system right away, and they did that even the same job market season that we proposed this Twitter approach [@EconJobMarket]. So they were the first to really make it transparent where employers were in that hiring process. The AEA has also adopted something like this and created a site where students who are looking for jobs can go and consult and see where that employer is in the process. So that's what got me started on EJM is just their willingness to be creative and try to help solve problems in the labor market for Ph.D. economists.\n\nSuiter: Your research has examined migration between states and cities, the impact of college education on geographic mobility and on health, and employer compensation and screening policies. What drew you to these particular topics?\n\nWozniak: I think, for me, what pulls together these topics is really major transitions that are incredibly important to individuals. So one of the things that drew me into labor economics versus some of the other economic phenomena that I found really interesting at the beginning was just the centrality of work in people's lives and how important it is to them on so many levels, not just on the livelihood level, but on the level of identity, on the level of meaning, on the level of community. And, these are all harder things for economists to study, but that kind of focus on, OK, how do folks choose this path for themselves and what are the steps that make it happen? That is the bigger set of questions that I think links up a lot of the projects that I've worked on.\n\nSo migration is really interesting because it's a major event in people's lives. I think folks remember all of them. I had a conversation with a cousin. I knew she had moved a lot as a kid, but she told me she had moved 17 times. And she obviously remembers every one of those and has counted them up.\n\nSo, even if you're moving a lot, it's something that, nevertheless, is really, really important to people. Whereas, you know, other choices they make tend to recede into the background or they forget them. So thinking about what determines whether someone makes that kind of move, what does it accomplish for them, how do they make that decision, those are all things that I find really interesting, and as we think about migration as a way for folks to really reach a better community that works better for them or strengthen their economic position or the opportunities that their children have, I think it's just, it continues to be incredibly interesting to me to think about why and how people make that decision and when does it work out for them and when could we have policies to support this and make it better. So all of those things, kind of, draw me to that question.\n\nThe same thing with the employment, I would call it, moment. So this is a really important black box in the labor market that sometimes I dip into, and I hope other folks will work on more as well. It's just that that moment of hiring, what goes into that? What pieces of information are employers using? What pieces of information are job applicants and workers using? All of our statistics just look at folks in terms of, like, they're employed or they're not employed, and what we're missing is that really important handshake or transition piece that I think holds a lot of information about who gets into the labor market, what are the challenges to getting in, how can we preserve jobs, where are jobs, when is it important for transitions to take place to promote mobility or flexibility in the labor market. Those are all questions that connect through that particular transition from being not in one job to in that job, and I find all of those related questions really interesting too.\n\nSuiter: This reiterates your comments earlier about studying what you're interested in and what you're passionate about and, clearly, you're passionate about these things. But they're also important ideas that can inform policy, and that brings great value to the research as well. It's research that can be used to help us make better decisions about policy related to things like people moving for jobs and people attending college and making that final decision about who you hire and things like that. Thank you for that work.\n\nWozniak: Thank you.\n\nSuiter: What challenges have you faced as a woman in economics, and how have you overcome them?\n\nWozniak: I don't know that I am going to point right now to very specific challenges. I think what I'd rather point to is I do feel that the last several years, from the onset of the #MeToo activism, because we know that #MeToo movement was started even before we saw large waves and significant waves of activism and stories around it.

That was diminishing very slowly over time, and I think those events just really forced a reckoning and a recognition that some of that incremental progress, there was no need for it really to be quite so slow. And when we looked at the economics profession in particular, the track record was unimpressive.

I'm hopeful that that will lead to real change in the norm. It remains to be seen whether this lasts.\n\nSo we'll see, but I'm optimistic because I do think we're thinking about things in a way that we weren't even just a handful of years ago.\n\nSuiter: Thank you. That makes me optimistic as well that those conversations will happen and, perhaps, those conversations will bring about some lasting change.\n\nAbbie, thank you so much for spending time today to tell us your story and share your wisdom.

While many Native people were simply unprepared for the challenges of city life –often encountering discrimination and denied good jobs or secure housing – a tight-knit Native American community flourished. Minnesota’s large Ojibwe and Lakota tribes made up the majority of the Twin Cities Indian community, but we know well that the community also welcomed and drew strength from the people of many other tribal nations who came here from across the country.

            "content": "Thank you, and thanks to the Department of Interior and my own colleagues at the Center for Indian Country Development, or CICD, for organizing this event. I’m glad to be with you today, on the historic land of the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community, for this convening on Indian Country land data. Land is the essence of Indian Country, and accurate and accessible land records are essential for Indian Country’s prosperity.\nI applaud your goal today—identifying improvements in how land records are collected, processed, and disseminated to better support residential and commercial development on reservations. What you are talking about are fundamental structural reforms, reforms that not only promote efficient and productive use of Indian Country’s vital land resources, but also affirm tribal sovereignty and self-determination.\nI’ve been thinking more and more about how to bring about these kinds of structural reforms, those that address critical issues like poverty, job opportunities, and affordable housing by boosting efficiency, productivity, and supply. So let me explain how your concerns are broadly parallel to my own concerns about the need for fundamental structural reforms to land and housing markets, and why I am pleased to join forces with you. Before I do, let me note that the views I express today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis or the Federal Reserve System.\nMy story is rooted in the nature of the Federal Reserve System. The Fed is the nation’s central bank. Our fundamental responsibility is monetary policy in pursuit of two objectives—maximum employment and stable prices, the so-called dual mandate that Congress has established for the Fed. The Fed also has been given significant authority as supervisor of financial institutions and as a provider of payments services. All of these responsibilities are common to many central banks around the world.\nBut the Fed stands out among central banks because of its decentralized structure. When Congress created the Fed in 1913, it did something unique: It distributed us across 12 regional, independent Federal Reserve Banks, rather than concentrating power in Washington, D.C. Congress did this to ensure that the many locally varying conditions across the United States are considered in economic policymaking. That’s why we have a Federal Reserve Bank in Minneapolis—to understand and represent the economic conditions in our region, the Ninth Federal Reserve District. And that’s why I spend a lot of my time meeting with community leaders across the Ninth District.\nOn one of those trips I met with a business executive who had just moved to Duluth, Minnesota. He said he’d found it very expensive to buy a home there. I was surprised to learn that he had come not from a small town but from Houston, Texas. How could it be that he found homeownership more expensive in Duluth than in one of America’s largest metropolitan areas?\nBut this was not an isolated example. Local leaders consistently tell me that affordable housing is one of the biggest challenges facing their communities. I hear it all the time and everywhere I go. I have heard it in Indian Country too, in recent visits with community leaders from South Dakota’s Native communities and from the Hannahville Indian Community, a small but thriving Native community in Michigan. That tells me that something in our housing system is structurally broken. Otherwise housing supply would respond to demand, and affordable housing would be only a temporary issue in certain fast-growing communities.\nThe only explanation that makes sense to me is that too many barriers impede the supply of land and buildings. However well intentioned, these barriers are driving up the cost of real estate and housing for everyone, although low- and moderate- income families feel the pain of high housing costs the most.\nThese supply barriers can take many forms. In many places the burdens directly raise construction costs—and I’m part of that problem myself because I live in a suburb, Orono, Minnesota, that requires large minimum lot sizes. In Indian Country these burdens often take the form of administrative processes that affect the availability of housing finance, particularly due to the trust status of the land. I know you will be discussing these issues today. Other common restrictions include limits on multifamily or manufactured housing. Some of these regulations sound good, but by pushing costs up, they also help put us in a housing affordability hole.\nWhen you’re in a hole, you should stop digging deeper. One way to start is to educate local leaders, including tribal leaders, on how decisions that may seem like good ideas in isolation collectively drive up the minimum cost of housing for families of modest means. In Indian Country, housing is intricately tied to the federal government and its regulation of tribal lands. I understand that part of the discussion today will be around the need to address fundamental problems with the quality of land data and the speed and reliability with which land records are processed.\nIn recent years we have allowed these barriers to mount while seeking ways around the problems they cause, often via additional appropriations for subsidized housing. The complaints about affordable housing that I hear in Indian Country and wherever I go tell me that the strategy of subsidized housing has fallen short of resolving the housing problem—and I can assure you it will continue to fall short. No matter how justified we may think those subsidies are, the number of families struggling with housing cost and availability issues far exceeds the subsidies we can afford.\nSo we need to complement the existing subsidy programs by boosting housing supply and bringing down the cost of housing. I have asked the Research staff at the Minneapolis Fed to help me identify where we can achieve the biggest net gains through reducing barriers to the supply of developable land and new homes. We’re just beginning to scratch the surface on this issue.\nGiven my views, I’m pleased that you are already engaged in a similar search for supply-boosting structural reforms in the Indian Country. The National Native Homeownership Coalition, the CICD, and staff at the Department of the Interior have organized an impressive array of information about how Indian Country housing and mortgage supply, and hence homeownership, have been held back by bottlenecks in loan processing. These include, I understand, fundamental limitations in trust land records and myriad bureaucratic practices for processing Indian Country land, lease, and loan transactions.\nYour collective goal of making it faster and easier to transact loans on trust land will benefit not only the housing market in Indian Country, but also its business sector. So the work you are doing here—to improve the accuracy of land records and the ease and speed of processing loans on trust land—exemplifies the type of fundamental structural reform we need to boost efficiency, while solving basic social problems.\nSo think deeply and boldly about how to protect what’s essential about trust land while also ensuring that it can be used efficiently to the full benefit of tribal communities. We at the Minneapolis Fed are committed to working with you to make progress on these important issues. Thank you.\n\nThank you, and thanks to the Department of Interior and my own colleagues at the Center for Indian Country Development, or CICD, for organizing this event. I’m glad to be with you today, on the historic land of the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community, for this convening on Indian Country land data.

What you are talking about are fundamental structural reforms, reforms that not only promote efficient and productive use of Indian Country’s vital land resources, but also affirm tribal sovereignty and self-determination.\n\nI’ve been thinking more and more about how to bring about these kinds of structural reforms, those that address critical issues like poverty, job opportunities, and affordable housing by boosting efficiency, productivity, and supply. So let me explain how your concerns are broadly parallel to my own concerns about the need for fundamental structural reforms to land and housing markets, and why I am pleased to join forces with you. Before I do, let me note that the views I express today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nMy story is rooted in the nature of the Federal Reserve System. The Fed is the nation’s central bank. Our fundamental responsibility is monetary policy in pursuit of two objectives—maximum employment and stable prices, the so-called dual mandate that Congress has established for the Fed. The Fed also has been given significant authority as supervisor of financial institutions and as a provider of payments services. All of these responsibilities are common to many central banks around the world.\n\nBut the Fed stands out among central banks because of its decentralized structure. When Congress created the Fed in 1913, it did something unique: It distributed us across 12 regional, independent Federal Reserve Banks, rather than concentrating power in Washington, D.C. Congress did this to ensure that the many locally varying conditions across the United States are considered in economic policymaking. That’s why we have a Federal Reserve Bank in Minneapolis—to understand and represent the economic conditions in our region, the Ninth Federal Reserve District. And that’s why I spend a lot of my time meeting with community leaders across the Ninth District.\n\nOn one of those trips I met with a business executive who had just moved to Duluth, Minnesota. He said he’d found it very expensive to buy a home there. I was surprised to learn that he had come not from a small town but from Houston, Texas. How could it be that he found homeownership more expensive in Duluth than in one of America’s largest metropolitan areas?\n\nBut this was not an isolated example. Local leaders consistently tell me that affordable housing is one of the biggest challenges facing their communities. I hear it all the time and everywhere I go. I have heard it in Indian Country too, in recent visits with community leaders from South Dakota’s Native communities and from the Hannahville Indian Community, a small but thriving Native community in Michigan. That tells me that something in our housing system is structurally broken. Otherwise housing supply would respond to demand, and affordable housing would be only a temporary issue in certain fast-growing communities.\n\nThe only explanation that makes sense to me is that too many barriers impede the supply of land and buildings. However well intentioned, these barriers are driving up the cost of real estate and housing for everyone, although low- and moderate- income families feel the pain of high housing costs the most.\n\nThese supply barriers can take many forms. In many places the burdens directly raise construction costs—and I’m part of that problem myself because I live in a suburb, Orono, Minnesota, that requires large minimum lot sizes. In Indian Country these burdens often take the form of administrative processes that affect the availability of housing finance, particularly due to the trust status of the land. I know you will be discussing these issues today. Other common restrictions include limits on multifamily or manufactured housing. Some of these regulations sound good, but by pushing costs up, they also help put us in a housing affordability hole.\n\nWhen you’re in a hole, you should stop digging deeper. One way to start is to educate local leaders, including tribal leaders, on how decisions that may seem like good ideas in isolation collectively drive up the minimum cost of housing for families of modest means. In Indian Country, housing is intricately tied to the federal government and its regulation of tribal lands. I understand that part of the discussion today will be around the need to address fundamental problems with the quality of land data and the speed and reliability with which land records are processed.\n\nIn recent years we have allowed these barriers to mount while seeking ways around the problems they cause, often via additional appropriations for subsidized housing. The complaints about affordable housing that I hear in Indian Country and wherever I go tell me that the strategy of subsidized housing has fallen short of resolving the housing problem—and I can assure you it will continue to fall short. No matter how justified we may think those subsidies are, the number of families struggling with housing cost and availability issues far exceeds the subsidies we can afford.\n\nSo we need to complement the existing subsidy programs by boosting housing supply and bringing down the cost of housing. I have asked the Research staff at the Minneapolis Fed to help me identify where we can achieve the biggest net gains through reducing barriers to the supply of developable land and new homes. We’re just beginning to scratch the surface on this issue.\n\nGiven my views, I’m pleased that you are already engaged in a similar search for supply-boosting structural reforms in the Indian Country. The National Native Homeownership Coalition, the CICD, and staff at the Department of the Interior have organized an impressive array of information about how Indian Country housing and mortgage supply, and hence homeownership, have been held back by bottlenecks in loan processing. These include, I understand, fundamental limitations in trust land records and myriad bureaucratic practices for processing Indian Country land, lease, and loan transactions.\n\nYour collective goal of making it faster and easier to transact loans on trust land will benefit not only the housing market in Indian Country, but also its business sector. So the work you are doing here—to improve the accuracy of land records and the ease and speed of processing loans on trust land—exemplifies the type of fundamental structural reform we need to boost efficiency, while solving basic social problems.\n\nSo think deeply and boldly about how to protect what’s essential about trust land while also ensuring that it can be used efficiently to the full benefit of tribal communities. We at the Minneapolis Fed are committed to working with you to make progress on these important issues. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Dick. About a year ago, I had the pleasure of welcoming a national audience to the Center for Indian Country Development’s Conference on Early Childhood Development in Indian Country. Today I’m pleased to welcome a new national audience to another CICD conference on education, this time on higher education.\nThe CICD and I both see education as potentially a great equalizer in our society. A child born into poverty who receives a good education can climb out of poverty and reach his or her full potential. But the real power of education, even beyond transforming an individual’s life, is that it also breaks the cycle of intergenerational poverty that continues to devastate so many families and communities. In that sense, this conference’s focus on a community perspective is wise and important.\nI’ll come back to the topic of education, but let me first give you some background on the Federal Reserve System and the work of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. As part of that, I should note that the views I express here are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Federal Reserve System, or the Fed, is a public institution serving the American people. We are the nation’s central bank. Our most fundamental responsibility is monetary policy in pursuit of two objectives—maximum employment and stable prices, the so-called dual mandate that Congress has established for the Fed. The Fed also has been given significant authority as supervisor of financial institutions and as a provider of payments services. All of these activities are common to many central banks around the world.\nWhat makes the Fed different, and what brings us together in Minneapolis today, is the Fed’s decentralized structure. One hundred four years ago, Congress created the Federal Reserve, our nation’s central bank. But they did something unique: They distributed the central bank across 12 regional, independent Federal Reserve Banks, rather than having it all housed at the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. Congress did this to ensure that different regions of the country were directly represented in economic policymaking and so that the many local varying conditions across the United States were appropriately considered. That’s why we have a Federal Reserve Bank in Minneapolis—to understand and represent the economic conditions in our region, which we call the Ninth Federal Reserve District.\nThe Minneapolis Fed’s charge has always included a responsibility for understanding the economies of the 45 federally recognized Indian tribes in the Ninth District. To leverage our decades of experience with tribal communities, we established the CICD in 2015 as a national resource and thought leader within the Federal Reserve System on Indian Country issues across the entire country. That’s why today’s conference deals with tribal communities generally, not just those in the Ninth District.\nYou may wonder, however, what does education have to do with the Fed? It comes back to our dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment. Education is clearly a key determinant of employment outcomes and the economy’s maximum rate of growth. People who receive more and better education tend to have more job options and lower unemployment, and they are more productive workers. It is vital that we understand education if we want to understand the drivers of maximum employment.\nAnd while the Federal Reserve may not have policy tools that can directly affect education, we do have world-class independent research capabilities that might be able to help. We have researchers in the Federal Reserve studying productivity growth that we, as our nation’s central bank, cannot directly influence. Similarly, if the Fed can objectively analyze education models that can help more Americans get and keep good jobs, I believe it is important we do that research and share our findings with other policymakers. This research may help us achieve maximum employment nationally and in places, such as many tribal communities, where underemployment has been a persistent problem.\nI also bring a personal belief in the transformative power of education and the importance of providing a good education to all children. I’m a middle-class kid, the son of immigrants, who has lived the American dream simply because he was able to get a good education at a mixture of public and private schools and universities. It is essential to America’s future that the opportunities for quality education that I took advantage of are available to all of our youth on an equitable basis.\nToday, however, we see large gaps in educational outcomes by race. This conference will focus on higher education outcomes for American Indians and Alaska Natives. Their outcomes have improved in recent decades, but remain too far below those of, for example, non-Hispanic whites. In many ways, the American higher education system is the envy of the world, and I and many others have benefited from its array of choices and high quality. However, we must know more about why a system that works well for so many simultaneously leaves behind far too many American Indians, Alaska Natives and other minority or low-income youth. I want to know what you, here at this conference, think about the factors behind these persistent gaps and how we can eliminate them.\nMy own thinking about education policy has focused on how our K-12 education system prepares young people for college, and I know you will be discussing that today too. I hold three strong views on the American K-12 education system. First, notwithstanding the good education that many American youth receive, the persistent racial, ethnic and socioeconomic achievement gaps are flat-out unacceptable. Second, because these gaps are unacceptable, we must act boldly and decisively to eliminate them. And I mean eliminate them, not just chip away at them. My own judgment, based on evidence to date, is that a combination of greater choice and greater accountability is critical to eliminating these gaps, as I argued in a speech at the Federal Reserve System’s Strong Foundations conference last March. But I have an open mind, consistent with my third strongly held view, that we need to devote more resources to detailed, hard-headed research on what really works in K-12 education.\nLet me close by illustrating some of what I find unacceptable today and discussing what the Minneapolis Fed is doing about it. Here is a chart, based on a decade of data from the Kids Count website, of the on-time graduation rates for Minnesota and Wisconsin high school students from three racial groups. Near the top of the chart, in the dotted orange line, you see that over 90 percent of non-Hispanic white students graduate on time in Wisconsin. The comparable rate in Minnesota, shown by the solid orange line, is only slightly lower.\nThe green lines show that graduation rates for African Americans are much lower in both states, typically between 60 percent and 70 percent. This is already unacceptable and in need of research and evidence-based action.\nBut look at the rates for American Indians, shown in the black lines. Wisconsin’s American Indian graduation rates are also unacceptably lower than for non-Hispanic whites. In Minnesota, however, they are not only far lower than for whites, but also far lower than for American Indians in Wisconsin or African Americans in either state.\nThe enormous gap in graduation rates between American Indians and non-Hispanic whites in Minnesota is absolutely unacceptable. The corresponding gap in Wisconsin is much smaller, and we cannot explain that away by saying that Wisconsin’s graduation standards are systematically different, given that outcomes for whites and African Americans do not diverge much between the two states. An alternative explanation—that the data themselves are of poor quality and cannot be trusted—also would be unacceptable; we simply must have accurate measures of essential outcomes like high school graduation rates. In short, something is just not OK here, and something needs to be done.\nThe Minneapolis Fed will not ignore these issues. Our approach will be to determine the causes of unacceptable gaps and then propose evidence-based solutions. To that end, we founded the Center for Indian Country Development, your conference organizer, in 2015. This year, we launched the Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute. The mission of the institute is to conduct and promote research that will increase economic opportunity and inclusive growth for all Americans and help the Federal Reserve achieve its maximum employment mandate. The institute uses a multidisciplinary approach that includes the participation of leading academics from a variety of fields, including economics, education, law, public health, public policy and sociology. It is guided by a world-class Advisory Board that helps identify promising research topics and operates mainly by sponsoring research and dialogue. Specific components include a Visiting Scholar program, a series of research conferences and the publication of working papers. Detailed information about all of these, including our October 26 conference on segregation and inequality, is on our website at minneapolisfed.org. If you are a scholar working on issues of economic opportunity and inclusive growth, we want you, so please check out the website.\nI tell my staff here to think boldly and strive for big, transformational improvements. In your conference today, I encourage you to do the same. Look at the higher educational outcomes in your community. If you see evidence of the big gaps, like those for high school graduation rates in Minnesota, I hope you also will see the need for decisive action and improvement. One thing I learned in battling the 2008 financial crisis is that you can’t tackle a crisis with incremental measures. Tackling a crisis requires overwhelming force, so think boldly and in terms of not just reforming but rather of transforming your education system. I believe an education system that fails large numbers of our youth is a crisis, and it demands a crisis response.\nThis is urgent work. Your communities and our nation cannot afford to shortchange the current generation of American Indian and Alaska Native students, let alone future generations. I promise you that as you seek the solutions that will work for you, I and my staff at the Bank and the Center for Indian Country Development will continue to support you through research, outreach and convenings like this. I am excited to be part of this conference and look forward to meeting and talking with you.\n\nThank you, Dick.

My own judgment, based on evidence to date, is that a combination of greater choice and greater accountability is critical to eliminating these gaps, as I argued in a speech at the Federal Reserve System’s Strong Foundations conference last March. But I have an open mind, consistent with my third strongly held view, that we need to devote more resources to detailed, hard-headed research on what really works in K-12 education.\n\nLet me close by illustrating some of what I find unacceptable today and discussing what the Minneapolis Fed is doing about it. Here is a chart, based on a decade of data from the Kids Count website, of the on-time graduation rates for Minnesota and Wisconsin high school students from three racial groups. Near the top of the chart, in the dotted orange line, you see that over 90 percent of non-Hispanic white students graduate on time in Wisconsin. The comparable rate in Minnesota, shown by the solid orange line, is only slightly lower.\n\nThe green lines show that graduation rates for African Americans are much lower in both states, typically between 60 percent and 70 percent. This is already unacceptable and in need of research and evidence-based action.\n\nBut look at the rates for American Indians, shown in the black lines. Wisconsin’s American Indian graduation rates are also unacceptably lower than for non-Hispanic whites. In Minnesota, however, they are not only far lower than for whites, but also far lower than for American Indians in Wisconsin or African Americans in either state.\n\nThe enormous gap in graduation rates between American Indians and non-Hispanic whites in Minnesota is absolutely unacceptable. The corresponding gap in Wisconsin is much smaller, and we cannot explain that away by saying that Wisconsin’s graduation standards are systematically different, given that outcomes for whites and African Americans do not diverge much between the two states. An alternative explanation—that the data themselves are of poor quality and cannot be trusted—also would be unacceptable; we simply must have accurate measures of essential outcomes like high school graduation rates. In short, something is just not OK here, and something needs to be done.\n\nThe Minneapolis Fed will not ignore these issues. Our approach will be to determine the causes of unacceptable gaps and then propose evidence-based solutions. To that end, we founded the Center for Indian Country Development, your conference organizer, in 2015. This year, we launched the Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute. The mission of the institute is to conduct and promote research that will increase economic opportunity and inclusive growth for all Americans and help the Federal Reserve achieve its maximum employment mandate. The institute uses a multidisciplinary approach that includes the participation of leading academics from a variety of fields, including economics, education, law, public health, public policy and sociology. It is guided by a world-class Advisory Board that helps identify promising research topics and operates mainly by sponsoring research and dialogue. Specific components include a Visiting Scholar program, a series of research conferences and the publication of working papers. Detailed information about all of these, including our October 26 conference on segregation and inequality, is on our website at minneapolisfed.org. If you are a scholar working on issues of economic opportunity and inclusive growth, we want you, so please check out the website.\n\nI tell my staff here to think boldly and strive for big, transformational improvements. In your conference today, I encourage you to do the same. Look at the higher educational outcomes in your community. If you see evidence of the big gaps, like those for high school graduation rates in Minnesota, I hope you also will see the need for decisive action and improvement. One thing I learned in battling the 2008 financial crisis is that you can’t tackle a crisis with incremental measures. Tackling a crisis requires overwhelming force, so think boldly and in terms of not just reforming but rather of transforming your education system. I believe an education system that fails large numbers of our youth is a crisis, and it demands a crisis response.\n\nThis is urgent work. Your communities and our nation cannot afford to shortchange the current generation of American Indian and Alaska Native students, let alone future generations. I promise you that as you seek the solutions that will work for you, I and my staff at the Bank and the Center for Indian Country Development will continue to support you through research, outreach and convenings like this. I am excited to be part of this conference and look forward to meeting and talking with you."

            "content": "Thank you, Patrice, for that very kind introduction. It is my pleasure to be with you all today to recognize your work on early childhood nutrition and development in Minnesota’s American Indian communities. I would especially like to thank the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community and the Better Way Foundation for the leadership and support they have provided to this Healthy Children, Healthy Nations initiative.\nI plan to talk a bit about how the work of the initiative aligns with what we do at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, starting with some of the origins of our work in Indian Country and on early childhood development. Before I do, I should note that my remarks reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis or the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Healthy Children, Healthy Nations initiative sits at an intersection of decades of work at the Minneapolis Fed on both Indian Country and on early childhood development. Our work in Indian Country, which today occurs under the umbrella of the Center for Indian Country Development, in fact dates back to at least the 1970s and has been a high-profile effort since the early 1990s. Our work in this area is driven by the fundamental regional structure of the Federal Reserve System as defined in the Federal Reserve Act, which created 12 Federal Reserve Districts across the country, each with its own independent Federal Reserve Bank responsible for understanding its District’s economy. In our Ninth Federal Reserve District, the 44 federally recognized American Indian reservations are prominent features of the regional economy. In addition, our Indian Country work is based on the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which directs us to monitor how banks are meeting the needs of low- and moderate-income communities; American Indian reservations figure prominently on our list of these areas.\nOur work on early childhood development also dates back decades and is tied to our concerns about low- to moderate-income communities. You might be surprised to learn, however, that the initial source of this work lies in our regional economic policy analysis. More than 20 years ago, one of my predecessors as Director of Research at the Minneapolis Fed, Art Rolnick, and others took a hard look at regional development policies in which state governments directed subsidies to individual corporations and found that they produced meager returns for the local economy and were harmful from a national perspective.1 When asked to offer a better regional economic development alternative, Art teamed with Rob Grunewald, another economist at the Minneapolis Fed, to document the long-lasting benefits and social returns from investing in high-quality early childhood programs.\nGiven this history, we are delighted to support the Healthy Children, Healthy Nations initiative. The work that you do to provide high-quality early childhood experiences is especially important in light of evidence that many of Minnesota’s American Indian mothers and children remain at risk. The statistics are striking: only 47 percent of Minnesota’s American Indian mothers received adequate prenatal care in 2015.2 The Minnesota Department of Human Services recently reported that about 1 in 10 pregnancies on reservations is affected by prenatal opiate use.3 These factors partly explain why American Indian infant mortality is twice as high as white infant mortality in Minnesota.4 In 2016, 23 percent of American Indian children ages two to five participating in the Minnesota Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children were considered obese, compared with 16 percent of white non-Hispanic children in the program.5 The percentage of American Indian children involved with Minnesota’s child protection system is 5 times higher than the percentage for white children,6 and placement in foster care is almost 20 times higher.7 Outcome gaps like these have persisted for decades, as shown by the fact that Minnesota’s Native American adults are significantly more likely than adults of other races to have experienced at least one of nine categories of adverse childhood experiences; 23 percent have had five or more adverse childhood experiences, compared with 7 percent among white adults.8\nThe disadvantages experienced by too many of Minnesota’s American Indian children transfer into gaps in educational outcomes. American Indian test scores are much lower than those of white children; for example, only 30 percent of Native American elementary and middle school students meet or exceed standards in math, compared with 68 percent of white students.9 Only about 52 percent of American Indian youth complete high school within four years in Minnesota, far below the 87 percent graduation rate for white teenagers.10\nThe gaps in outcomes that prevail in Minnesota’s American Indian communities point to gaps in the opportunities available within these communities. Understanding and removing these opportunity gaps is the aim of the Minneapolis Fed’s new Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute.11 The design of the Institute reflects the limits on what the Fed can and cannot do. The Fed is not Congress; we cannot pass laws. Nor does the Fed have the power to appropriate funds in order to write checks to support specific programs. As the Fed is an independent nonpartisan organization, we cannot advocate in favor of specific pieces of legislation. However, there is still much that the Fed can do: The Fed can listen to and learn from the people in our communities. We can use our analytical capacity to isolate the causes of opportunity gaps and to identify promising policies to close them. And, we can partner with groups on the ground, bringing interested parties together to help forge coalitions to tackle these problems directly.\nReflecting these capabilities, the Institute’s aim is to conduct and promote basic research into the forces that limit opportunity and inclusion. We recognize that these forces are complex and that opportunity gaps have persisted for decades in spite of the devoted efforts of many talented people. But this is not a reason for moving slowly. We have already assembled a group of world-class experts drawn from economics, sociology, law, and political science as our Board of Advisors,12 and at an Institute conference at the end of May we listened to their ideas about where the Fed should focus its efforts.13 Informed by their advice, we established a visiting scholars program to facilitate the interaction of outstanding researchers while they are in residence in Minneapolis.14 We also established a new working paper series that has already released more than 20 titles highlighting work on opportunity gaps by researchers throughout the Fed system.15 Just as importantly, we are listening to and learning from people outside of academia, including community leaders and community development professionals.\nThe Healthy Children, Healthy Nations initiative is an excellent example of how cutting-edge research and a community participatory process can be combined to address key social and economic issues. Research by the Minneapolis Fed has found that the returns on investments in young children are enormous. After taking into account the effect on future school performance, increased earnings, decreased crime, and decreased welfare expenditures, this research has found that an extra $1 spent on the education of vulnerable children returns between $4 and $16.16 Research also shows large positive returns to investments in health and nutrition programs for families with pregnant women and young children. For example, the Michigan Maternal Infant Health Program finds $1 spent on prenatal health education aimed at reducing use of tobacco, alcohol, and drugs reduces preterm births by 3 percentage points, yielding returns of $1.38 in the first month of life alone.17\nIt is important to pause for a moment to reflect upon just how large these returns are. To put them in context, note that we live in a time when a 1 percent return annually on our savings accounts looks very attractive and where our federal government can borrow for 30 years at a rate under 3 percent. In such a world, investments that pay for themselves within a few years—and, in some cases, only a few months—and that can accumulate returns over an entire lifetime of more than 500 percent—and, in some cases, possibly more than 1,500 percent—are staggering. They are, quite simply, investments that make both dollars and sense.\nAs an economist, I’ve been trained to apply hard-headed analytical techniques to the evaluation of public policy programs. In return, I am sometimes called hard-hearted. But the application of hard-headed analytics to the policies advocated by well-meaning, compassionate people occasionally uncovers unintended adverse consequences, while at other times it reveals that, although a policy may work as intended, it returns far too little to justify the expense involved. While I sympathize with the motivations of these policy advocates—I self-identify as soft-hearted—it is important to recognize that every dollar spent on one policy program is a dollar that is unavailable for another. It is therefore important that we work to weed out ineffective policies (if I were being uncharitable, I might call them “soft-headed” policies) and direct expenditures toward those policies that do the most good. What makes the work of the Healthy Children, Health Nations initiative so exciting is that it champions soft-hearted policies that survive the test of hard-headed analysis.\nThank you.\nEndnotes\n1 See Economic Bidding Wars, Minneapolis Fed website.\n2 Minnesota Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, Minnesota Department of Health.

            "content": "Thank you, Steven, for that kind introduction. I appreciate you and the Minneapolis Urban League for hosting this event today, and I look forward to our discussion. Before I begin, I would like to remind everyone that my remarks today are my own and don’t necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee.\nOne hundred four years ago, Congress created the Federal Reserve, our nation’s central bank, but they did something unique: They distributed the central bank across 12 regional, independent Federal Reserve Banks, rather than having it all housed at the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. Congress did this to ensure that different regions of the country were directly represented in economic policymaking and so that the many local varying conditions across the United States were appropriately considered. That’s literally why we have a Federal Reserve Bank in Minneapolis—to understand and represent the economic conditions in our region, which we call the Ninth Federal Reserve District.\nI have been president of the Minneapolis Fed for just over one year. Although I grew up in the Midwest, I am new to the Ninth District, so getting out across the district and getting to know our many communities, their strengths and their challenges is very important to me. In that regard, we’ve had a productive first year: I’ve traveled across the Ninth District, visiting many parts of Minnesota, but also North and South Dakota, Montana, Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\nPeople have repeatedly asked me what has most surprised me about our region and, specifically, about Minnesota. Our region has many strengths: a diverse economy, with agriculture, manufacturing, natural resources, health care and technology sectors all represented. The business community here has an unusually strong, genuine interest in civic engagement and giving back to the community, complemented by strong nonprofit and philanthropic sectors. We also have an educated, high-performing workforce and, on average, low unemployment. That workforce is supported by an education system that consistently ranks near the top in national surveys. Minnesota ranks number three in the country according to test scores, with 45 percent of our students above the proficiency level. Our high school graduation rate is 92.4 percent, which is the second best in the country. Our labor force participation rate is seventh highest, and our poverty rate ties for the third lowest in the United States.\nThose are some of the positives—there is indeed much to be proud of. Yet I was surprised to learn with all that success, our region and Minnesota in particular have some of the worst racial and economic disparities in the country. Difference in median income between whites and African Americans is $30,000, giving us a rank of 41st across states. Moreover, we rank 40th in unemployment gap, 40th in test score gaps and 42nd in differences in high school graduation rates. I didn’t expect to find this, and I don’t understand why it is that way.\nSo I began to ask questions of our research economists at the Minneapolis Fed. Why do we have these gaps? The truth is we don’t know for sure. I asked community leaders. I asked nonprofit leaders. I heard a variety of answers: education issues, lack of economic development, discrimination, among other explanations. But none of the answers seemed complete to me—nor did they seem complete to those offering the suggestions.\nI began looking around the country and asking researchers across the Federal Reserve System. For example, David Wilcox, the Director of Research and Statistics at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., and I discussed the fact that unemployment among African Americans is generally about twice the level for whites. If the economy is strong and white unemployment is 4 percent, African American unemployment will likely be around 8 percent. At the worst of the last recession, when white unemployment was around 8 percent, African American unemployment was around 16 percent. Even if you compare college graduates against college graduates, the relative position is similar. Why is that? What are the structural factors leading to those disparities? To be honest, we don’t really know. And we need to know the answers to these fundamental questions if we hope to develop effective solutions.\nBut this isn’t just about racial disparities, though those are very important. Instead of having this discussion at the Urban League in North Minneapolis, we could be having a similar discussion on the Iron Range, one of the first regions I visited after joining the Bank, where many workers and families are struggling because of low iron ore prices and few mining jobs. We could be having this conversation about a lack of economic opportunity and inclusive growth in rural communities around the Ninth District that are struggling. We could be having this meeting in Wisconsin or Michigan, where some manufacturing plants have downsized or shut down altogether in recent decades. We could be having this conversation in almost any state in our nation. A lack of economic opportunity does not know racial or ethnic or even geographic boundaries. There are people in all communities who are struggling to get a fair chance at a good education and a good job. How do we create a robust, growing economy that includes all Americans in the context of globalization and ongoing technological change? How do we ensure that all Americans have genuine economic opportunity for themselves and their families?\nThe American Dream is a central tenet of our society, yet, in the last 30 years the proportion of Americans who have stopped believing in it has tripled: from 10 percent to 30 percent. And quite aside from believing it, many no longer are seeing it: As Raj Chetty’s work has shown, a far smaller portion of people born in 1980 have achieved a higher standard of living than their parents, compared with what was true 25 or 50 years earlier.\nEarlier this week we celebrated the life and legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr., but we also remember the principles he committed his life to—justice, equality, the inherent human dignity of every man, woman and child. When we measure ourselves against these principles, we can acknowledge progress, but we must be honest in our assessment and continue with a renewed energy because there is much work yet to be done.\nCongress has given the Federal Reserve a dual mandate: stable prices and maximum employment. I translate stable prices as an economy that’s not overheating but also not limping along—steady growth. Maximum employment is conceptually clear, though difficult to measure: How do we have an economy that is growing at the highest sustainable level such that as many Americans who want to work are able to work? That’s the mandate that Congress has given us.\nNow the traditional view among central bankers is that there’s not much we can do about economic opportunity and inclusive growth. The reason is that monetary policy, our primary policy tool, is a blunt instrument. We have to set one interest rate for the whole nation, for all of our people and businesses. We can’t target it to certain sectors, industries, regions, communities or ethnic groups. So we have to look at the aggregate data on the national economy to see if we are achieving our dual mandate on average over time.\nBut is it really true that we shouldn’t look underneath the averages to see what effect our national policies are having on different groups? I think we should be open to re-examining that assumption. For example, Minnesota is ranked number one in the country for home ownership at 74.7 percent of occupied houses. But if we look across different groups, we find that while 77.1 percent of whites in our state own their homes, only 27.6 percent of African Americans do so.\nAnd, perhaps most importantly, the Federal Reserve System employs some of the best researchers in the world, with hundreds of Ph.D. economists on staff around the country. Even if we conclude that monetary policy isn’t the best tool for addressing issues around economic opportunity and inclusive growth because it is too blunt, we still have an important role to play. If we can do the research to understand the root causes of the problems and identify potential fiscal policy solutions or other approaches, I believe it is appropriate for the Federal Reserve to do that research and inform the public about our findings. Achieving our maximum employment mandate might require a combination of traditional monetary policy tools as well as research into nonmonetary solutions for other policymakers to consider.\nI have discussed these issues at length with Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, and she is in full agreement that the Federal Reserve has an important role to play in addressing these issues.\nSo today I am announcing that we are establishing the Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute (the Institute), which will be housed at the Minneapolis Fed. The mission of the Institute will be to conduct and promote research that will increase economic opportunity and inclusive growth for all Americans and help the Federal Reserve achieve its maximum employment mandate.\nSerious academic work on many of these issues is being done at universities across the country, and some is already being done across the Federal Reserve System. We don’t want to duplicate what researchers are already doing. We want to complement their work and bring the focused perspective of one of the most important economic policy institutions in our nation to these issues. Our Institute will adopt a multidisciplinary approach that includes the participation of leading academics from a variety of fields, including economics, education, law, public health, public policy and sociology.\n“The Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute is an important research initiative focusing on some of the most pressing economic issues we face as a nation. This work has the potential to help more Americans find real economic opportunity. I hope that scholars inside and outside the Federal Reserve System will contribute to this important work,” said Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen.\nThe Institute will have a number of important components to start.\nFirst, we have recruited a world-class Advisory Board to help us identify topics where the Federal Reserve System can make a significant contribution that complements work already being done elsewhere.\nSecond, we are launching an annual Visiting Scholar program, which will invite scholars to pursue research while in residence at the Minneapolis Fed, working side by side with Federal Reserve researchers. If you are a scholar working on issues of economic opportunity and inclusive growth, we want you! Detailed information about how scholars can apply is on our website at minneapolisfed.org.\nThird, we are launching a conference series to bring together experts from within and from outside the Federal Reserve System to learn as much as we can from each other on these important issues. The first conference will be on May 22 of this year when we will explore where the Federal Reserve can best focus our talents and resources to make growth and opportunity more inclusive.\nFinally, we are creating a working paper series to showcase the research that people across the Federal Reserve System and affiliated experts are producing so that other researchers and practitioners can learn, comment and take it forward.\nToday is just the kickoff. The hard work is yet to come. In many cases, these issues are decades in the making. We aren’t going to find a silver bullet in six months or a year. But we need to ramp up our efforts, in partnership with leading researchers around the country. This is going to be a long-term, research-driven initiative focused on helping all Americans have real economic opportunity and participate in a growing economy.\nWe know that these issues are not going to be solved by the Federal Reserve alone. But we are going to do our part. Researchers in universities around the country are already playing an important role, as are educators, community leaders and local, state and federal policymakers. The nonprofit and philanthropic communities are doing critically important work on the ground, putting theoretical ideas into action. The Institute will focus on world class research. But this is not an effort divorced from all of you. Ideas on where we should investigate, feedback on our efforts and work to turn the research into practical policy falls to all of us. We look forward to working with and learning from you.\nThank you. I look forward to the discussion with Steven and then opening it to the audience.\n\nThank you, Steven, for that kind introduction.

            "content": "This speech is also available on Medium\nThank you, Chairman Lundgren, for that warm introduction.1,2 I would also like to thank the Economic Club of New York for inviting me today, and David Wessel, of the Brookings Institution, for joining us to moderate our discussion. Before I begin, I would like to remind everyone that the views I express today are my own, and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Board of Governors, which sets supervision and regulatory policy for the Federal Reserve System.\nIn February, I announced that the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis was launching an initiative to develop a plan to end the problem of too big to fail (TBTF) banks, and I committed us to releasing a plan by the end of the year. Today we are fulfilling that commitment.\nI believe our initiative demonstrates the strength of the distributed structure of the Federal Reserve System that Congress created more than 100 years ago, which they designed to encourage a diversity of perspectives on important economic issues.\nThe purpose of my speech is to introduce the Minneapolis Plan to end TBTF. I will give some background on the development of the plan, describe what it accomplishes, walk through the key steps of the plan, and then I look forward to discussing it with David and then with the audience.\nThis morning, we published two documents: First, a Summary for Policymakers and, second, the Full Proposal of the Minneapolis Plan. Those of you here in the audience have a hard copy of the summary in front of you. Both documents are available on the Minneapolis Fed website.\nI come at the TBTF problem from the perspective of a policymaker who was on the front line responding to the 2008 financial crisis. When Congress moved quickly to pass the Dodd-Frank Act (the Act) in 2010, I strongly supported the need for financial reform, but I wanted to see the Act implemented before I drew firm conclusions about whether it solved TBTF.\nOver the past six years, my colleagues across the Federal Reserve System have worked diligently under the reform framework Congress established and are fully utilizing the available tools under the Act to address TBTF. While significant progress has been made to strengthen the U.S. financial system, I believe the biggest banks are still TBTF and continue to pose a significant, ongoing risk to our economy.\nOur initiative brought together a wide range of experts on financial crises and banking regulation through a series of symposiums in Minneapolis and Washington, D.C. By design, we wanted to hear all views. Some experts argued in favor of the current regulatory framework, while others argued for more transformational approaches. We learned something from everyone who participated, and we are grateful for their willingness to candidly share their ideas.\nExpert participants in our symposiums included former policymakers such as former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, Vice Chairman Roger Ferguson, and Governor Randy Kroszner. They included leading academics, such as Anat Admati of Stanford and Simon Johnson of MIT, among many others. They included policy experts from think tanks, such as Adam Posen of the Peterson Institute and Aaron Klein of the Brookings Institution. And they included economists currently working at policymaking institutions, such as Giovanni Dell'Ariccia of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Mark Flannery of the Securities and Exchange Commission. At every symposium, we invited the private sector to participate and were pleased to hear from experts across several segments of the financial services industry, including John Bovenzi of Oliver Wyman and Michael Hasenstab of Franklin Templeton. The largest banks, however, refused to participate, for fear their presence would be viewed as an acknowledgement that the TBTF problem still exists. We didn’t allow their parochial objections to impede our work.\nOur goal was not only to learn as much as possible from these experts, but also to help educate the public about these important topics, so our symposiums were all open to the press and live-streamed to the public via our website. I thank the members of the press who have covered, and continue to cover, this initiative. Their work is essential to informing the public. All presented materials and videos of all symposiums are available at minneapolisfed.org. And as we have done throughout our process, we continue to seek comments from the public. That is why we are releasing the Minneapolis Plan with a 60-day comment period.\nThe ultimate goal of our initiative is to equip the public and their elected representatives with the information and analyses they need to assess what progress has been made in ending TBTF, to understand what risks remain, and to give them additional options to enhance the safety of the U.S. financial system.\nOne of the key messages we repeatedly heard from experts throughout our initiative is the need to understand both costs and benefits when considering potential regulatory reforms. Indeed, as I will show you, an objective assessment of costs and benefits is the foundation on which the Minneapolis Plan is built.\nOne useful analogy that helps highlight the trade-off of costs and benefits is the risk of terrorism. Intuitively, the public understands that we as a society cannot eliminate all risk of a future terrorist attack. It is simply impossible to make that risk zero. And the public intuitively understands that increased physical safety isn’t free. There are costs associated with hiring additional law enforcement officers, for example, or installing more metal detectors. Since we cannot eliminate all risk, we have to decide how much safety we want and what price we are willing to pay for that safety. The same is true for financial crises. We cannot make the risk zero, and safety isn’t free. Regulations can make the financial system safer, but they come with costs of potentially slower economic growth. Ultimately, the public has to decide how much safety they want in order to protect society from future financial crises and what price they are willing to pay for that safety.\n  We have developed a framework for assessing safety and costs. The first column says “Chance of a Bailout in the Next 100 Years.” The IMF has compiled a database of financial crises around the world that we use to assess how frequently financial crises have happened in the past and what regulations were in place when those crises happened. Fortunately, financial crises are infrequent events, but that makes them hard to predict, like terrorist events or earthquakes. This IMF database contains the best data available to look at the history of financial crises and make informed estimates about their future likelihood. We look at a 100-year time horizon because the Great Depression took place in the 1930s and the recent financial crisis in 2008, approximately 80 years later. Aiming to prevent financial crises over a 100-year time horizon seems like a reasonable goal, given how devastating crises are when they hit.\nOn the right side of the table, we list costs. Here we calculate the present value of future costs, using a similar method as do regulators around the world.\nWe set as a baseline the capital regulations that existed in 2007, before the onset of the recent financial crisis. An examination of the IMF database of crises and the regulations that existed in 2007 implies an 84 percent chance of a crisis in the following 100 years. Obviously, the crisis in fact happened the next year. The database offers a view of how likely crises are to happen, not when exactly they will happen. In terms of costs, we set the 2007 regulations as a baseline, so we assume those costs are zero for comparison purposes.\nNext we look at the current capital regulations, which have increased capital requirements relative to 2007. As you can see from the table, the probability of a future financial crisis has been reduced, from 84 percent to 67 percent over the next 100 years. That is a modest improvement in safety at a cost of 11 percent of GDP. Is 11 percent of GDP a lot or a little?\nHere we see that the Bank for International Settlements’ consensus estimate for the typical cost of a banking crisis is 158 percent of GDP, which for the U.S. economy equals roughly $28 trillion. This is the present value of the long-term effects of a banking crisis. As we have seen since the recent crisis, the U.S. economy has been growing much more slowly than had been previously expected. These long-term effects are fairly typical for financial crises, which as you can see, are extraordinarily costly for society. Against that enormous cost, 11 percent of GDP seems to me to be a small price to pay for a modest increase in safety.\nIn contrast, the Minneapolis Plan goes much further to improve safety, admittedly at an increased cost. The Minneapolis Plan has multiple steps.\nI will explain what these steps are in a few moments. With Step 1 of the Minneapolis Plan, we reduce the risk of a future financial crisis and bailout from 67 percent under current regulations to 39 percent, a substantial improvement in safety. And as you can see, the additional safety isn’t free. Costs increase to 24 percent of GDP, which is still very small compared with the typical cost of a banking crisis, 158 percent.\nFinally, in Step 2 of the Minneapolis Plan, we reduce the risk of a future crisis and bailout to as low as 9 percent. Again, the added safety isn’t free. The total cost is as high as 41 percent of GDP, which is much higher than current regulations, but still much smaller than the cost of a financial crisis. To say it another way, if the Minneapolis Plan prevents one financial crisis, it will have paid for itself multiple times over. These are the trade-offs the public needs to understand in order to assess whether we have done enough to end TBTF or if we should go further. To me, these data make it very clear that we should go much further.\nNext I will describe the Minneapolis Plan.\n  Here I describe the four steps of the Minneapolis Plan and compare them with the current regulatory framework.\nStep 1 of the Minneapolis Plan dramatically increases capital requirements for all bank holding companies larger than $250 billion to 23.5 percent of risk-weighted assets. And we count only common equity as capital. That is a key difference from current regulations, which also set 23.5 percent as the total amount of loss absorption that the largest banks must have, but current regulations include long-term debt in that amount. History has shown that long-term debt is not useful protection against losses in a crisis. That’s why we insist on common equity.\nStep 2 of the Minneapolis Plan then calls on the U.S. Treasury Secretary to analyze and certify that individual large banks are no longer TBTF. If the Treasury Secretary refuses to certify a large bank as not TBTF, that bank will face dramatically increasing capital requirements, until either the Treasury Secretary certifies it as no longer TBTF or its capital reaches 38 percent. This is a critical step, because today there is no time limit for solving the TBTF problem. Today, banks can enjoy their explicit or implicit status as being TBTF potentially indefinitely. In contrast, the Minneapolis Plan puts a hard deadline on Treasury: Certify banks as no longer TBTF within five years, or else that bank will see dramatic increases in capital requirements. We believe the threat of these massive increases in capital will provide strong incentives for the largest banks to restructure themselves so that they are no longer systemically important. Any bank that remains TBTF will have so much capital that it virtually cannot fail. This is the approach regulators have taken with nuclear power plants. People understand that if a nuclear reactor melts down, it is devastating for society. Rather than ban nuclear power, regulators impose such tight restrictions on it in order to truly minimize the risk of failure. Step 2 takes the same approach with the largest banks.\nStep 3 imposes a tax on debt for large shadow banks, greater than $50 billion, including hedge funds, mutual funds, and finance companies, of either 1.2 percent or 2.2 percent, depending on whether they are systemically risky. One of the concerns many experts expressed was the potential for risky activity to move from banks to shadow banks. If we increase capital requirements on banks and the risky activity just moves to large shadow banks, has safety actually improved? To protect against this scenario, our proposed tax will roughly level the playing field between banks and shadow banks by equalizing the cost of the funding so that activity doesn’t just move to a less-regulated segment of the financial system. Shadow banks that do not utilize debt funding will not pay any tax.\nFinally, Step 4 rationalizes regulations on community banks, which are not systemically risky for the U.S. economy and that do have a vital role to play in American communities. Banks with less than $10 billion in assets should be subject to a much simpler and less burdensome regulatory framework that reflects their relative lack of risk to the economy.\nI have gone through these steps very quickly. We will no doubt go into more depth in the discussion, and there are full details in the published materials.\nNow let me turn back to how we estimate the probabilities of future financial crises, because this is essential to evaluating whether current regulations go far enough or if we should do more.\n  As I mentioned, we utilize the best data available on historical financial crises, data from the IMF. This chart utilizes the IMF data to estimate the probability of a future bailout as a function of capital requirements in the banking sector. The X axis is capital ratios and the Y axis is the odds of a bailout over a 100-year time horizon. The black line has steps in it, because it represents actual data from past financial crises, and, as I mentioned previously, crises are fortunately infrequent events. The red line is a smoothed version of the same data, which we use in some of our calculations.\nThe blue star at the top of the chart indicates the regulatory system in 2007, before the crisis.\nThe star a little down from it shows the current regulatory framework, a modest increase in capital and a modest reduction in risk.\nThe next star shows Step 1 of the Minneapolis Plan, with a larger increase in capital and a much larger reduction in risk.\nFinally, the bottom star shows Step 2 of the Minneapolis Plan, with a dramatic increase in capital and reduction in risk for the largest banks. We know this is not an exact science, but looking at prior financial crises is the best way we know how to estimate the effect of potential regulations in order to assess safety in the U.S. financial system.\nFinally, what will the financial system look like after the Minneapolis Plan has been fully implemented? We will have fewer mega banks, and there will be far less concentration in the banking system. We expect that community banks will thrive and mid-size banks will make up a far larger share of the overall system. The financial system as a whole will be much, much better capitalized and capable of withstanding a major shock without triggering a crisis. If there are any TBTF banks left, they will be so well-capitalized that their risk of failure will truly have been minimized. Like terrorism, we can’t eliminate all risk. But we believe the Minneapolis Plan does a much better job of reducing risks at reasonable costs to society than current regulations. Ultimately, the public needs to make their own determination. We hope this process will equip them with the data and analyses they need to make an informed judgment.\nThank you. I now look forward to our discussion.\n[Presentation slides]\nEndnotes\n1 I wish to thank Javier Bianchi, V.V.

            "content": "Thank you, Patrice. It’s a pleasure, in more ways than one, to welcome all of you to this conference. It’s a pleasure, in part, because getting to know a broad range of people like you, and to learn about the issues you care about, is one of the most important and enjoyable responsibilities of a Reserve Bank president. It’s also pleasing because this conference marks a significant milestone—it’s the first major conference at the Bank for our new Center for Indian Country Development. We established the center last year with a mission to help American Indian communities throughout the United States attain their economic development goals. Education, one of the CICD’s primary areas of focus, is a fundamental building block for reservation workforce and economic development.\nMost of all, however, I’m excited to welcome you because your topic, early childhood development in Indian Country, is directly related to one of my own core public policy concerns—ensuring that all American children get a first class education.\nBefore I expand on that, let me give you some background on the Federal Reserve System and the work of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank. As part of that, I should note that the views I express here are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Federal Reserve System, or the Fed, is a public institution serving the American people. We are the nation’s central bank. Our most fundamental responsibility is monetary policy in pursuit of two congressionally determined objectives—maximum employment and stable prices. The Fed also has been given significant authority as supervisor of financial institutions and as a provider of payments services. All of these activities are common to many central banks around the world.\nWhat makes the Fed different, and what brings us together here today, is the Fed’s decentralized structure. Over 100 years ago, Congress created a central bank compatible with the size and diversity of our country. Congress decided that this critical public institution, the U.S. central bank, would not be based just in Washington or New York. Instead, 12 independent Reserve Banks are dispersed across the country, in central cities like Minneapolis, where my peers and I are charged with developing a broad understanding of the communities, economies, and policy concerns of our regional district. It’s that broader mandate that brings us together today—the opportunity to contribute to an array of public policy issues, not just monetary policy.\nWhile this event is the Center for Indian Country Development’s first conference at the Bank, I should note that this work builds on a long tradition here at the Minneapolis Fed. As far back as the 1970s, we were engaged with tribal communities on economic development issues. That work has since then accelerated in scope and scale.\nA key player in that effort has been our Helena, Montana, Branch Executive Sue Woodrow, who is with us here today. Sue’s work with tribes, especially on business development and commercial law codes, is nationally known. This will be Sue’s last major Indian Country conference with the Bank, as she has announced that she will retire at the end of the year. Sue, we will miss you and the energy and focus you’ve brought to this work. But you and I know that the center will be in good hands with Patrice, who will extend the Bank’s commitment to supporting economic growth in Indian Country.\nThis conference taps into another important tradition here at the Minneapolis Fed—our years of research and outreach on the economic and social benefits of high-quality programs for at-risk young children. About 15 years ago, two of today’s presenters, Minneapolis Fed Economist Rob Grunewald and our former Research Director Art Rolnick, assembled facts showing that well-targeted investments in early childhood development not only improve long-term outcomes for the children, but also yield high rates of return to society at large. This message has resonated across the country and around the world, as well as in Indian Country, as we will see in our conference today. Thus, I am so proud to welcome you to a conference that brings together two of this Bank’s strongest traditions—our work on Indian Country development and on early childhood development.\nTo this mix I add my own firmly held beliefs—of the transformative power of education and the importance of providing a good education to all children. Like you, I know that education matters for each person individually and for society as a whole. At a personal level, I believe that a good education is the great equalizer in our society. It clearly has contributed to the success of the eminent American Indian speakers you will hear from today and tomorrow. And it did the same for me, a middle class kid, the son of immigrants, who has lived the American dream simply because he was able to get a good education.\nBy opening these doors of opportunity for individuals, education has the potential to address two big issues confronting the nation, as well as Indian Country—economic growth and economic inequality. Nationally, growth since the Great Recession has been steady but stubbornly slow, leaving output well below expectations. This has contributed to exacerbating the persistent and wide gaps in income among our country’s racial and ethnic groups.\nThese issues of economic inclusion clearly affect Indian Country, where average incomes remain far below national standards. Improving and equalizing educational opportunities for all Americans, including American Indians and Alaska Natives, is essential to enhanced productivity and growth, and to the elimination of racial and ethnic income gaps.\nFor example, Minnesota’s detailed educational assessments show that only 44 percent of American Indian children arrive at kindergarten fully ready to learn, compared with 57 percent of black children and 62 to 63 percent of Asian and white children. These kinds of readiness gaps, observed in other parts of the country too, are one reason that American Indian and Alaska Native children are held back and made to repeat kindergarten at a rate 75 percent higher than for white children. In other words, society is leaving too many Native students behind right at the starting gate. This holds back not only the children, but also our future workforce and economy. At the other end of the spectrum, research shows that top-tier Native students are second to none and achieve large personal and societal benefits if they finish college. So it’s a national priority, not just an Indian County issue, to ensure that all American Indian and Alaska Native students reach their full potential in the future American workforce.\nAs we discuss how to transform the educational system, it is appropriate to first consider the importance of early childhood programs in carrying those gains forward through the K-12 and postsecondary educational systems. We need to finally and forever close the educational achievement gaps that hold back American Indian, Alaska Native, and other minority communities.\nTo that end, let me share with you some of my own views on educational reform. First, I embrace the view that access to good schools is every American child’s basic civil right. I have an open mind about how we create those good schools and will continue to refine my views based on emerging research and experience. Our 50 states and well over 500 independent tribal governments give the United States a rich laboratory of local educational programs to learn from. Through conferences like this and other channels, we need to share the examined evidence from schools and educational programs across the nation. Tribal community leaders have a great opportunity to use their sovereign powers to see what works and decide which reforms to champion and adopt in their own communities. For my part, I have been impressed by the ability of many schools to significantly improve student outcomes when families and educators are engaged in the entire educational system. I encourage you to consider the programs discussed in this conference and seek solutions that work best for you in your own communities to support early childhood development.\nAs you do, I encourage you to think boldly. Look at the educational outcomes in your community. If you see evidence of the big gaps indicated in state and national data on American Indian and Alaska Native students, such as test scores and high school graduation rates that lag well below national average, I hope you also will see the need for decisive action and improvement. One thing I learned in battling the 2008 financial crisis is that you can’t tackle big problems with incremental measures. Big problems require big changes, so think boldly and in terms of not just reforming but rather of transforming your educational system.\nThis is urgent work. Your communities and our nation cannot afford to shortchange the current generation of American Indian and Alaska Native students, let alone future generations. I promise you that as you seek the solutions that will work for you, I and my staff at the Bank and the Center for Indian Country Development will continue to support you, through research, outreach, and convenings like this. I am excited to be part of this conference and look forward to meeting and talking with you.\n\nThank you, Patrice. It’s a pleasure, in more ways than one, to welcome all of you to this conference.

            "content": "Note1\nGood morning, and welcome to Day 2 of the 2015 Federal Reserve System Community Development Research Conference. I hope you found yesterday’s presentations on economic mobility rich and thought provoking, and I am pleased to say that we have an equally interesting agenda today. I congratulate the conference organizers at the Board of Governors and the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for making this outstanding event possible. They have set a high standard for the next conference in 2017, when the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis will take on the role that St. Louis played this year.\nThese biennial conferences serve an important purpose for the Federal Reserve System and, I hope, community development researchers and practitioners in general. On the one hand, much community development work is necessarily very local, requiring deep understanding of the specific issues in thousands of individual communities around the world. On the other hand, a wide perspective is also needed, to understand how each community contends with the broad social and economic forces shaping regions, nations, and the globe. Furthermore, just as each community faces its own special circumstances and challenges, each also has its own lessons to teach us. So it is important to convene, from time to time, a great many thinkers and practitioners in a conference like this, to place our varied community development experiences, insights, and best practices within a common framework. For my part, as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, I want to talk to you about the community development needs and opportunities on American Indian reservations, by which I mean the self-governing American Indian communities collectively defined in federal law as Indian Country. But before I begin, let me note that the views I express today are my own, and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis or the Federal Reserve System.\nTo set the stage for my discussion, recall that, in the 19th century, hundreds of formerly independent and culturally distinct tribes were forced onto reservations, often in remote areas. For many decades thereafter, their cultures and traditional governing institutions were suppressed, their land base was further stripped away, and their affairs were largely controlled and governed by federal officials who permitted little local autonomy. Not surprisingly, economic development lagged on most reservations, leaving them as pockets of extreme rural poverty and underdevelopment. By the 1970s, however, civil rights activism and a shift toward decentralized economic policymaking created a consensus in support of greater tribal self-government. A combination of executive orders and federal legislation finally put tribal sovereignty and self-governance on firmer footing. At about the same time, other initiatives—separate in specifics, but similar in spirit—led to the passage of the Community Reinvestment Act (or CRA) and the formation of the Federal Reserve System’s Community Development function. Thus, meaningful tribal sovereignty within the United States and the Federal Reserve System’s formal commitment to community development both began about 30 to 40 years ago.\nThe community development needs of American Indian reservations immediately stood out by CRA’s criterion of low-to-moderate income. In 1970, the per capita income of Indians on reservations was, in units of 2009 dollars, not far above $5,000 per year. This was about half to two-thirds of the income of Blacks, Hispanics, and nonreservation Indians and about a third of the income of Whites. The per capita income of reservation Indians did not reach $10,000 per year until Census 2000 and is still not far above that low threshold. Even now, poverty rates on reservations are nearly triple the national rate, and over 40 percent of children on reservations live in poverty.2\nIt is also important to note that progress has been made. Growth in real per capita income on Indian reservations accelerated in the 1990s and has outpaced U.S. per capita income growth since then. As a result, the gaps have narrowed somewhat over time, and especially since the year 2000. I won’t go into the details, but this is occurring even on many reservations without large casinos and reflects a lot of hard work by tribes and tribal members across the country. There’s still a long way to go. But we should take heart, and draw inspiration for research, from the fact that on hundreds of reservations, representing over 90 percent of the reservation Indian population, per capita income has grown relatively fast over the past two decades.\nThe community development efforts of the people in this room and their partners around the world and in the Federal Reserve System also may have contributed, at least on the margin, to this relatively rapid growth in reservation Indian income since 1990. The Federal Reserve System’s own work in Indian Country escalated in the early 1990s, after the denial of a proposed banking industry merger due to concerns that one of the institutions involved was not adequately serving an Indian reservation’s credit needs. Partly as a result of this case, the Minneapolis Fed was encouraged by banks and tribes to assist in the development of enhanced tribal commercial laws, to facilitate the flow of credit on reservations. That effort blossomed into a major commitment that has continued through the development of a model tribal secured transactions law in 2005 and continues today in further work with tribes and the Uniform Law Commission toward a model tribal probate code.3 To complement the commercial law initiatives, we helped organize Indian business alliances in several states, so that Indian business owners and others can advocate for good business laws and address financial and other barriers to business development on reservations. Other Reserve Banks, notably San Francisco and Kansas City, undertook related initiatives, such as programs to promote mortgage lending on reservations, and worked hard to build partnerships with the relevant federal agencies as well. Together and with staff at the Board of Governors, we organized periodic national listening sessions and conferences with tribal leaders, such as the Walking the Native Path conference in 1999, the Banking Opportunities in Indian Country conference in 2002, and a series of events across the country in 2011-2012. These last culminated in the Growing Economies in Indian Country national summit meeting at the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., in April 2012, where I was honored to deliver a keynote address on Indian Country economic development.4\nDespite some encouraging progress, real per capita income remains disturbingly low on Indian reservations relative to the rest of the country. I will now discuss how the more recent research on intergenerational mobility presented at this conference adds another layer of concern about the level of economic development in Indian Country.\nThe seminal paper on intergenerational mobility by Chetty, Hendren, Kline, and Saez has already been highlighted at this conference. However, let me reintroduce some of its key concepts before I apply them to Indian Country. One concept is a commuting zone, which is just a small group of contiguous counties, such as an MSA in urban areas that serves as a spatial definition of a local labor market. The other concept is absolute intergenerational mobility.5 For each commuting zone, the Chetty study determines how children who matured there ultimately rank in the national income distribution as adults, at about age 30. Then they regress children’s ranks on their parents’ rank in the national income distribution about 14 years earlier. This determines a linear relationship, for each commuting zone, that predicts a child’s rank based on the parents’ rank. Finally, the Chetty research focuses on children whose parents’ incomes were below the national median income, as represented by a child whose parents ranked at the 25th percentile of the national income distribution. The higher the child’s rank compared to the parents, the greater the level of absolute mobility. For the 1980-82 birth cohort, children of parents at the 25th income percentile typically rose to about the 43rd income percentile by age 30, where “typical” refers to the median commuting zone. In other words, median absolute mobility is about 43. However, the measure ranges considerably among commuting zones, from as high as 64 to as low as 27, a fact that has stimulated a lot of discussion at this conference.\nIndian Country is a part of that discussion, as I know well. That lowest absolute mobility figure of 27 occurs in the Minneapolis Federal Reserve District in a commuting zone that is dominated by reservation land.6 However, the association of Indian reservations and low absolute economic mobility is not limited to my part of the country. The map shows the distribution of the absolute mobility measure by commuting zones, with darker colors indicating lower mobility.7 It also shows the outlines of Indian reservations in the contiguous 48 states. You can see, especially in the western states where the majority of the reservation population resides, a tendency for reservations to fall within the more darkly colored commuting zones. A similar pattern shows up if I ignore reservation boundaries and simply pick out commuting zones with a relatively high percentage of American Indian, Alaska Native, or Native Hawaiian individuals.\nIn fact, for statistical purposes, let me focus on commuting zones where at least 5 percent of the population identifies as American Indian (alone). This picks out 72 commuting zones across the country, generally with significant reservations or Alaska Native settlements, and eliminates commuting zones where the American Indian population is too small to strongly affect the overall results. For those 72 commuting zones, the correlation between absolute mobility and the percentage of the population that identifies as American Indian is -0.7. The least mobile of the 72 are 17 commuting zones that fall in the bottom three deciles of the absolute mobility distribution reported in the Chetty study.8 These 17 have American Indian populations ranging from 5,000 to over 150,000 and are found not just in the Great Plains but also in Alaska, Hawaii, the Southwest, and the Southeast.\nWe can see, then, that American Indian reservations and population centers are significant in the lower tail of the intergenerational mobility distribution revealed by the research of Chetty and his co-authors. In my view, these findings of low intergenerational mobility underscore the urgency of addressing economic underdevelopment in Indian Country. It’s not just that incomes have been very low on reservations for decades. We now have large-scale and very current evidence of poverty persisting across generations within individual families in many reservation-dominated commuting zones. This persistence represents a social and economic failure to develop the full productive and human potential of many of our children.\nWhat then can be done to facilitate more rapid intergenerational mobility? Our understanding of effective solutions remains incomplete. However, it’s worth noting that the Chetty study also shows that low mobility correlates with certain economic and social factors that vary across commuting zones. Commuting zones with a high percentage of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian individuals do not rank low on all of these factors. But they do on some of the most closely correlated factors, including school quality, as measured by either test scores or dropout rates.\nThis next chart shows the relationship between test scores, on the horizontal axis, and absolute mobility, on the vertical axis. The test score measure is expressed as the deviation, in percentile units, of the commuting zone’s actual average test score from the test score predicted for that commuting zone in a regression of test scores on parental income. Thus, half of the mass of all the dots is to the right of zero and half is to the left. The red dots show commuting zones where American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiians make up 5 percent or more of the population. Although there are important exceptions to learn from, the mass of the red dots is shifted to the left, with low test scores (adjusted for parental income). Indeed, the far left-hand tail of the test score distribution consists primarily of commuting zones with a high percentage of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian individuals and low mobility. Again, this is only a correlation, not necessarily a causal relationship. But it suggests that we consider education as a factor in the low mobility seen in Indian Country and as an area where additional community development assistance and learning from best practices may be valuable.\nMore generally, though, the observations on low intergenerational mobility in Indian Country call for better research on the often complex causal relationships with factors like segregation, low-quality schools, and single-parent households. They also call for sustained and well-coordinated multidimensional work on community development in Indian Country.\nAt the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, we are responding to these calls and intend to take the Federal Reserve System’s long-standing work with tribal communities to a new level. In 2015, the Bank will establish a new Center for Indian Country Development. As you see in my next slide, its mission is “to help self-governing communities of American Indians in the United States attain their economic development goals.” Note that this mission is national in scope. This reflects our intent that the Center provide energy and coordination to Indian Country development initiatives across the Federal Reserve System and take a lead role in forging Federal Reserve partnerships with other national and regional organizations.\nOur current Indian Country experts will continue their work through the Center. Some of you know Sue Woodrow, currently our Helena Branch officer and formerly a member of our Community Development staff. She has led many of our Indian Country initiatives since the early 2000s, including our core work on tribal business law development and implementation. I am happy to announce that Sue will serve as a co-director of the Center.\nSue’s leadership will allow the Center to build on our Bank’s past work on business law in Indian country. But the mission of the new Center is deliberately broad in scope. It allows us to engage in a range of new issues, potentially including intergenerational mobility and related topics such as Indian Country education and workforce development. Accordingly, we are currently in the process of searching for a second co-director and expect to find an executive with a record of strong accomplishments in Indian Country. At the leadership level, the two co-directors will give the Center continuity as well as new energy and insights.\nIn addition, and even more importantly over the long term, we are establishing an external Leadership Council composed of 10 to 12 regional and national experts in Indian Country development matters. Its purpose will include advising on and assisting with the development of the Center’s strategy and priorities. We also expect the Leadership Council to advise on emerging issues and policy matters and to assist in building important partnerships and support for the work of the CICD.\nOur plan is to officially launch the Center, and its website, by mid-year. Until then, we are posting information and updates at the website you see at the bottom of my slide.\nAs you may know, I have decided to not seek reappointment when my term as president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank ends next February. I expect to look back on the establishment of the Center for Indian Country Development as an important part of my legacy and am happy to say that it has the strong support of our management team and board of directors. When you meet again for the 2017 Federal Reserve System Community Development Research Conference, I hope that you will be hearing good things about the work and research of the Center for Indian Country Development. Even more importantly, I hope you will also hear about improvements in education, income, business development, and economic mobility in lower-income communities across the nation, including our American Indian reservations.\nThank you.\nEndnotes\n1 I thank Susan Woodrow and especially Dick Todd for much help in developing these remarks.\n2 See Akee and Taylor (2014, pp. 42-43).\n3 For more background on this and related work, see Kocherlakota 2011 and https://www.minneapolisfed.org/community/indian-country.\n4 See Kocherlakota (2012).\n5 Chetty et al. (2014) also define a relative mobility measure that I will not make use of. Loosely speaking, an area’s relative mobility compares children from the area’s lower-income families with children from the area’s upper-income families according to the typical difference between their respective places in the national distribution of income when they are adults. Intergenerational mobility in Indian Country is much closer to national norms by the relative mobility measure than by the absolute mobility measure. I focus on the absolute mobility of children from low-to-moderate income families, who account for the majority of children on reservations.\n6 See Wirtz (2014).\n7 Including Alaska and Hawaii would not change the overall pattern significantly.\n8 See Chetty et al.

I hope you found yesterday’s presentations on economic mobility rich and thought provoking, and I am pleased to say that we have an equally interesting agenda today. I congratulate the conference organizers at the Board of Governors and the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for making this outstanding event possible. They have set a high standard for the next conference in 2017, when the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis will take on the role that St. Louis played this year.\n\nThese biennial conferences serve an important purpose for the Federal Reserve System and, I hope, community development researchers and practitioners in general. On the one hand, much community development work is necessarily very local, requiring deep understanding of the specific issues in thousands of individual communities around the world. On the other hand, a wide perspective is also needed, to understand how each community contends with the broad social and economic forces shaping regions, nations, and the globe. Furthermore, just as each community faces its own special circumstances and challenges, each also has its own lessons to teach us. So it is important to convene, from time to time, a great many thinkers and practitioners in a conference like this, to place our varied community development experiences, insights, and best practices within a common framework. For my part, as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, I want to talk to you about the community development needs and opportunities on American Indian reservations, by which I mean the self-governing American Indian communities collectively defined in federal law as Indian Country. But before I begin, let me note that the views I express today are my own, and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nTo set the stage for my discussion, recall that, in the 19th century, hundreds of formerly independent and culturally distinct tribes were forced onto reservations, often in remote areas. For many decades thereafter, their cultures and traditional governing institutions were suppressed, their land base was further stripped away, and their affairs were largely controlled and governed by federal officials who permitted little local autonomy. Not surprisingly, economic development lagged on most reservations, leaving them as pockets of extreme rural poverty and underdevelopment. By the 1970s, however, civil rights activism and a shift toward decentralized economic policymaking created a consensus in support of greater tribal self-government. A combination of executive orders and federal legislation finally put tribal sovereignty and self-governance on firmer footing. At about the same time, other initiatives—separate in specifics, but similar in spirit—led to the passage of the Community Reinvestment Act (or CRA) and the formation of the Federal Reserve System’s Community Development function. Thus, meaningful tribal sovereignty within the United States and the Federal Reserve System’s formal commitment to community development both began about 30 to 40 years ago.\n\nThe community development needs of American Indian reservations immediately stood out by CRA’s criterion of low-to-moderate income. In 1970, the per capita income of Indians on reservations was, in units of 2009 dollars, not far above $5,000 per year. This was about half to two-thirds of the income of Blacks, Hispanics, and nonreservation Indians and about a third of the income of Whites. The per capita income of reservation Indians did not reach $10,000 per year until Census 2000 and is still not far above that low threshold. Even now, poverty rates on reservations are nearly triple the national rate, and over 40 percent of children on reservations live in poverty.2\n\nIt is also important to note that progress has been made. Growth in real per capita income on Indian reservations accelerated in the 1990s and has outpaced U.S. per capita income growth since then. As a result, the gaps have narrowed somewhat over time, and especially since the year 2000. I won’t go into the details, but this is occurring even on many reservations without large casinos and reflects a lot of hard work by tribes and tribal members across the country. There’s still a long way to go. But we should take heart, and draw inspiration for research, from the fact that on hundreds of reservations, representing over 90 percent of the reservation Indian population, per capita income has grown relatively fast over the past two decades.\n\n\n\nThe community development efforts of the people in this room and their partners around the world and in the Federal Reserve System also may have contributed, at least on the margin, to this relatively rapid growth in reservation Indian income since 1990. The Federal Reserve System’s own work in Indian Country escalated in the early 1990s, after the denial of a proposed banking industry merger due to concerns that one of the institutions involved was not adequately serving an Indian reservation’s credit needs. Partly as a result of this case, the Minneapolis Fed was encouraged by banks and tribes to assist in the development of enhanced tribal commercial laws, to facilitate the flow of credit on reservations. That effort blossomed into a major commitment that has continued through the development of a model tribal secured transactions law in 2005 and continues today in further work with tribes and the Uniform Law Commission toward a model tribal probate code.3 To complement the commercial law initiatives, we helped organize Indian business alliances in several states, so that Indian business owners and others can advocate for good business laws and address financial and other barriers to business development on reservations. Other Reserve Banks, notably San Francisco and Kansas City, undertook related initiatives, such as programs to promote mortgage lending on reservations, and worked hard to build partnerships with the relevant federal agencies as well. Together and with staff at the Board of Governors, we organized periodic national listening sessions and conferences with tribal leaders, such as the Walking the Native Path conference in 1999, the Banking Opportunities in Indian Country conference in 2002, and a series of events across the country in 2011-2012. These last culminated in the Growing Economies in Indian Country national summit meeting at the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., in April 2012, where I was honored to deliver a keynote address on Indian Country economic development.4\n\nDespite some encouraging progress, real per capita income remains disturbingly low on Indian reservations relative to the rest of the country. I will now discuss how the more recent research on intergenerational mobility presented at this conference adds another layer of concern about the level of economic development in Indian Country.\n\nThe seminal paper on intergenerational mobility by Chetty, Hendren, Kline, and Saez has already been highlighted at this conference. However, let me reintroduce some of its key concepts before I apply them to Indian Country. One concept is a commuting zone, which is just a small group of contiguous counties, such as an MSA in urban areas that serves as a spatial definition of a local labor market. The other concept is absolute intergenerational mobility.5 For each commuting zone, the Chetty study determines how children who matured there ultimately rank in the national income distribution as adults, at about age 30. Then they regress children’s ranks on their parents’ rank in the national income distribution about 14 years earlier. This determines a linear relationship, for each commuting zone, that predicts a child’s rank based on the parents’ rank. Finally, the Chetty research focuses on children whose parents’ incomes were below the national median income, as represented by a child whose parents ranked at the 25th percentile of the national income distribution. The higher the child’s rank compared to the parents, the greater the level of absolute mobility. For the 1980-82 birth cohort, children of parents at the 25th income percentile typically rose to about the 43rd income percentile by age 30, where “typical” refers to the median commuting zone. In other words, median absolute mobility is about 43. However, the measure ranges considerably among commuting zones, from as high as 64 to as low as 27, a fact that has stimulated a lot of discussion at this conference.\n\nIndian Country is a part of that discussion, as I know well. That lowest absolute mobility figure of 27 occurs in the Minneapolis Federal Reserve District in a commuting zone that is dominated by reservation land.6 However, the association of Indian reservations and low absolute economic mobility is not limited to my part of the country. The map shows the distribution of the absolute mobility measure by commuting zones, with darker colors indicating lower mobility.7 It also shows the outlines of Indian reservations in the contiguous 48 states. You can see, especially in the western states where the majority of the reservation population resides, a tendency for reservations to fall within the more darkly colored commuting zones. A similar pattern shows up if I ignore reservation boundaries and simply pick out commuting zones with a relatively high percentage of American Indian, Alaska Native, or Native Hawaiian individuals.\n\n\n\nIn fact, for statistical purposes, let me focus on commuting zones where at least 5 percent of the population identifies as American Indian (alone). This picks out 72 commuting zones across the country, generally with significant reservations or Alaska Native settlements, and eliminates commuting zones where the American Indian population is too small to strongly affect the overall results. For those 72 commuting zones, the correlation between absolute mobility and the percentage of the population that identifies as American Indian is -0.7. The least mobile of the 72 are 17 commuting zones that fall in the bottom three deciles of the absolute mobility distribution reported in the Chetty study.8 These 17 have American Indian populations ranging from 5,000 to over 150,000 and are found not just in the Great Plains but also in Alaska, Hawaii, the Southwest, and the Southeast.\n\nWe can see, then, that American Indian reservations and population centers are significant in the lower tail of the intergenerational mobility distribution revealed by the research of Chetty and his co-authors. In my view, these findings of low intergenerational mobility underscore the urgency of addressing economic underdevelopment in Indian Country. It’s not just that incomes have been very low on reservations for decades. We now have large-scale and very current evidence of poverty persisting across generations within individual families in many reservation-dominated commuting zones. This persistence represents a social and economic failure to develop the full productive and human potential of many of our children.\n\nWhat then can be done to facilitate more rapid intergenerational mobility? Our understanding of effective solutions remains incomplete. However, it’s worth noting that the Chetty study also shows that low mobility correlates with certain economic and social factors that vary across commuting zones. Commuting zones with a high percentage of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian individuals do not rank low on all of these factors. But they do on some of the most closely correlated factors, including school quality, as measured by either test scores or dropout rates.\n\nThis next chart shows the relationship between test scores, on the horizontal axis, and absolute mobility, on the vertical axis. The test score measure is expressed as the deviation, in percentile units, of the commuting zone’s actual average test score from the test score predicted for that commuting zone in a regression of test scores on parental income. Thus, half of the mass of all the dots is to the right of zero and half is to the left. The red dots show commuting zones where American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiians make up 5 percent or more of the population. Although there are important exceptions to learn from, the mass of the red dots is shifted to the left, with low test scores (adjusted for parental income). Indeed, the far left-hand tail of the test score distribution consists primarily of commuting zones with a high percentage of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian individuals and low mobility. Again, this is only a correlation, not necessarily a causal relationship. But it suggests that we consider education as a factor in the low mobility seen in Indian Country and as an area where additional community development assistance and learning from best practices may be valuable.\n\n\n\nMore generally, though, the observations on low intergenerational mobility in Indian Country call for better research on the often complex causal relationships with factors like segregation, low-quality schools, and single-parent households. They also call for sustained and well-coordinated multidimensional work on community development in Indian Country.\n\nAt the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, we are responding to these calls and intend to take the Federal Reserve System’s long-standing work with tribal communities to a new level. In 2015, the Bank will establish a new Center for Indian Country Development. As you see in my next slide, its mission is “to help self-governing communities of American Indians in the United States attain their economic development goals.” Note that this mission is national in scope. This reflects our intent that the Center provide energy and coordination to Indian Country development initiatives across the Federal Reserve System and take a lead role in forging Federal Reserve partnerships with other national and regional organizations.\n\n\n\nOur current Indian Country experts will continue their work through the Center.

            "content": "Note1\nThanks for the introduction, and thank you for the invitation to join you here today.\nMy speech today has two distinct parts. The first part has to do with monetary policy. There has been a great deal of recent public conversation about Federal Reserve accountability with respect to monetary policy. I view my talk as being a natural outgrowth of that dialogue. American monetary policymakers like me are employees of the public. As I’ll describe, we are charged by the public’s representatives with achieving certain objectives. In keeping with this employer-employee relationship, my remarks loosely mimic a standard performance evaluation of the kind that takes place in corporations all over America each year. I first provide an assessment of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) performance over the past three years relative to the Committee’s monetary policy goals. I then turn to what I see as appropriate plans for the FOMC in 2015, given the Committee’s goals.\nMy remarks differ in a key respect from many or possibly most other discussions about the FOMC. It is common to focus on what actions the Committee has taken, such as our decisions about asset purchases or interest rates. In my view, these discussions about what has been done are really tangential to monetary policy accountability. Accountability—in any endeavor, including monetary policy—is not about what actions have been taken. Rather, it’s about the results those actions achieve—specifically, how well performance accords with the relevant objectives. Accordingly, my discussion of FOMC performance and plans is relentlessly goal-oriented.2\nThe second part of my speech has to do with community banks. It follows up on remarks that I made last year about improving supervision and regulation by tailoring rules and approaches to the actual risks posed by these entities. I’ll discuss some recent beneficial changes along these lines and suggest some opportunities for further improvements.\nAs I said, the second part of my speech is distinct from the first part about monetary policy. Nonetheless, I see them as entirely consistent with each other. In the first part, I will emphasize the need for monetary policy to achieve the macroeconomic goals set forth by Congress. In the second part, I will describe how tailoring of supervision and regulation can help facilitate the Federal Reserve’s pursuit of these same objectives. Throughout my remarks today, please keep in mind that I will be expressing my own views, and they are not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nI look forward to responding to, and learning from, your questions at the conclusion of my remarks.\nFederal Reserve System objectives\nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to set the path of interest rates over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. However, the Committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a rotating group of four other presidents. I’m not one of those four presidents this year. At FOMC meetings, we decide on the level of monetary stimulus for the economy. For now, I won’t get into too many details of what that term “monetary stimulus” means except to make two high-level points. First, when the FOMC changes the level of stimulus, our actions tend to push inflation—that is, the rate of growth of prices—and employment in the same direction. Raising the level of stimulus puts upward pressure on both inflation and employment. Lowering the level of stimulus puts downward pressure on both inflation and employment. Second, the FOMC’s actions only affect inflation and employment with a lag, usually thought to be about one-and-a-half to two years.\nWhat is the FOMC seeking to achieve by varying the level of monetary stimulus? Congress has charged the FOMC with making monetary policy to promote price stability and to promote maximum employment. The FOMC has interpreted the first goal, price stability, to mean keeping inflation close to 2 percent. The FOMC’s job is to vary monetary stimulus over time to meet these mandated objectives.\nMaximum employment\nWith that context, I now turn to an assessment of the FOMC’s evaluation over the past three years. I’ll begin by showing you data on FOMC performance with respect to its maximum employment mandate over the past three years.\nThe best known measure of labor market performance is the unemployment rate.\nLarge chart\nIn December 2011, the unemployment rate was 8.5 percent. Since that date, the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.6 percent. The fall was especially rapid in 2014. However, the unemployment rate remains elevated compared to the FOMC’s assessments of its long-run value.\nThe unemployment rate is the most widely known measure of labor market performance. But there are good reasons to view it as only one of many useful labor market metrics. Recall that, to estimate the unemployment rate, the Census Bureau asks people two questions: Are you working? And, if not, have you looked for work in the past four weeks? The unemployment rate measures the ratio of the second number—the recent job searchers—to the sum of the two numbers (the recent job searchers and the workers). This means that the unemployment rate can decline for two reasons: because more people are finding work or because fewer people are looking for work. Much of the decline in the unemployment rate over the past three years has occurred because the fraction of people who are looking for work has fallen. This characterization is borne out if we look at the evolution of the fraction of people over the age of 16 who have a job—what’s called the employment-to-population ratio.\nLarge chart\nIn December 2011, the employment-to-population ratio was 58.5 percent. It has risen, but only to 59.2 percent. Arithmetically, this means that people getting jobs accounts for well under one-half of the fall in the unemployment rate over the past three years.\nThe good news is that the employment-to-population ratio did grow markedly in the past year. And this increase is especially notable given underlying demographic trends. As the baby boom birth cohort—born between 1946 and 1964—ages, the fraction of retirees in the population grows steadily. This demographic force, in and of itself, would have led to a decline in the employment-to-population ratio over the past three years.\nOne simple way to adjust for this demographic impulse is to focus on people in their prime working-age years. Here, I’ve plotted the fraction of the population aged 25 to 54 who have a job.\nLarge chart\nAgain, we have seen steady improvement in this fraction over the past three years. The rate of improvement was especially marked in the past year.\nOf course, just because someone has a job does not mean that they are necessarily fully employed. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports each month on the number of Americans who are working part time, would like to work more hours, but are unable to obtain those additional hours. That fraction of the labor force has fallen over the past three years.\nLarge chart\nAll told, these charts document improvement in all of these measures of labor market performance over the past three years. And in all three measures, the rate of improvement was especially rapid in the past year.\nShould Americans view the FOMC’s performance with respect to the maximum employment mandate as being satisfactory? That’s a hard question to answer on the basis of these pictures alone. Employment growth is clearly better than no growth (or, worse, negative growth). But we are still left with the question: Should the FOMC have facilitated even faster employment growth? To answer this question, we need to examine the behavior of prices.\nPrice stability\nAccordingly, I now turn to the FOMC’s performance relative to its price stability objective. As I noted earlier, operationally, the FOMC has translated this objective into keeping the rate of increase of the price level—that is, the inflation rate—close to 2 percent. Even more specifically, the FOMC uses what’s called the personal consumption expenditures (or PCE) price index to calculate inflation. This measure of inflation captures the rate of increase in all goods and services, including those related to food and energy.\nHere’s a graph of how PCE inflation has behaved over the past three years.\nLarge chart\nI see three main take-aways from this picture. First, PCE inflation has averaged 1.3 percent per year since December 2011. This is well under the FOMC’s 2 percent target. Second, PCE inflation has been below 2 percent for a long time—over two-and-a-half years. Finally, there was little pickup in inflation last year.\nThe American public should certainly not expect the FOMC to hit its inflation target every month. But two-and-a-half years is a long time. The FOMC’s performance in terms of price stability can be summarized pretty simply: The Committee has not provided sufficient stimulus to hit its inflation target.\nThis persistent underrun of the inflation target creates a risk to the credibility of the Committee’s target. For monetary policy to be effective, it is critical that investors and other members of the public believe that the FOMC is in fact aiming at 2 percent inflation, and not at some higher or lower figure. Persistent deviations from the target may weaken those beliefs.\nRecently, there have been signs of exactly this kind of reduction in FOMC credibility in financial market data. Here, we’ve plotted the behavior of two market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations.\nLarge chart\nThe main take-away is that both of these metrics have drifted downward over the past three years. Indeed, they have fallen especially sharply in the past few months. The FOMC, so far, has largely failed to take substantial policy action in response to these declines. That lack of a response creates additional downside risk to the credibility of the 2 percent inflation target.\nI close my discussion of price stability by circling back to a question about the employment mandate that I posed earlier: Should the FOMC have stimulated more rapid employment growth? The data on inflation suggest an answer to this question. Recall that monetary stimulus pushes both employment and prices in the same direction. By providing somewhat more stimulus, the FOMC could have stimulated at least somewhat more employment growth, without creating undue inflation. I am sure that this faster employment growth would have been welcomed by the American public. So, even though employment grew, it seems that there was an improvement opportunity: The FOMC should have facilitated even faster employment growth.\nMy summary assessment is that the FOMC underperformed in the past three years with respect to the price stability mandate and the employment mandate. I’m sometimes asked, “What concrete actions could the FOMC have taken to provide additional stimulus?” I think one concrete action would have been not to reduce stimulus. In mid-2013, the FOMC began communicating about the eventual elimination of its asset purchase program that took place from December 2013 and October 2014. These communications, and the follow-up actions, served as a tightening of monetary policy. Accordingly, they were associated with sharp increases in market interest rates and sharp reductions in the rate of home mortgage refinancing.\nFuture choices\nI’ve discussed FOMC performance over the past three years relative to the FOMC’s objectives. I now want to turn to the question of how I believe monetary policy stimulus should evolve over the coming year so as to best achieve the FOMC’s objectives. I will focus on the particular issue of how the FOMC should adjust the target range for the fed funds rate—the short-term interbank lending rate. As has been true for over six years, the target range is currently set between zero and a quarter percentage point. The main issue facing the Committee is: Should that target range be raised soon?\nTo answer this question, I find it helpful to return to my earlier analogy of a corporate performance evaluation. Many employees in America are evaluated in terms of their performance with respect to pre-assigned goals. They are given a great deal of latitude in terms of how to make choices that will achieve those objectives. The best employees, of course, are the ones who consistently use that flexibility to optimize their success with respect to their pre-assigned goals.\nThe FOMC—an employee of the public—also enjoys a great deal of latitude. To be a good employee, it should use that latitude to optimize its success with respect to achieving its macroeconomic goals. This goal-oriented approach to monetary policywould focus on keeping the economy as close as possible to the FOMC’s objectives for prices and employment.\nA goal-oriented approach has sharp implications for near-term monetary policy decisions. My own current assessment is that it will take a few years for inflation to return to 2 percent from its current low level. As I noted earlier, monetary policy affects prices with about a two-year lag. Raising the target range for the fed funds rate in 2015 would only further retard the pace of the slow recovery in inflation. It would also increase the risk of a loss of credibility, in the sense that the public could increasingly perceive the FOMC as aiming at a lower inflation target. Hence, given my current outlook for inflation, I anticipate that, under a goal-oriented approach, the FOMC would not raise the fed funds rate target this year.\nDeciding not to reduce stimulus in 2015 would also be consistent with a goal-oriented approach to the employment mandate. Increases in stimulus would push upward on employment. Such an increase in employment is entirely consistent with the pursuit of maximum employment that Congress has mandated for the FOMC.\nAdmittedly, there has been considerable skepticism over the course of the past five years about the ability of monetary or fiscal policy to stimulate employment growth. I have expressed some of those concerns myself on occasion. But look at how rapidly employment actually grew in 2014! The job market is—finally—on a highly desirable upward trajectory. We are more likely to continue on that welcome trajectory if the FOMC does not tighten monetary policy in 2015.\nCommunity Banks\nIn the rest of the talk, I will turn my attention to community banks. I see community banks as playing an important role in promoting the price and employment goals of the Federal Reserve. Supervision and regulation of these entities is, of course, necessary to mitigate the risk of taxpayer loss. But it is also necessary for the supervisory and regulatory framework to be appropriately structured to allow community banks to fulfill their necessary economic function.\nI will build on remarks I made in the summer of 2014, where I discussed the need to better tailor supervision and regulation to the risks actually posed by community banks. In those remarks, I emphasized the benefits of a statutory approach to tailoring. I’m glad to be able to report that there has been progress along those lines since I spoke in the summer. In that speech, I also provided two additional tailoring options: one concerning regulation and one concerning supervision. We have seen progress on the regulatory options, and I will review those advances. I will conclude with additional thoughts on supervisory tailoring.\nThe statutory advance with respect to regulatory tailoring concerns an expansion in the number of small bank and thrift holding companies exempted from consolidated capital requirements. Late last year, Congress put the vast majority of holding companies, both bank and savings and loan holding companies, with $1 billion or less in assets under the Fed’s small bank holding company policy. This means that approximately 25 additional holding companies in Minnesota will now avoid capital requirements. The Board of Governors issued an interim final rule and notice of proposed rulemaking on Jan. 29, 2015, to further implementation of the new law.  Comments on the rule and the proposal are due by March 4, 2015, and I encourage all of you to provide your feedback.  \nThere are several features of this reform worthy of emulation:\nCongress exempted select small firms explicitly and clearly by statute. As I emphasized last summer, this is the best way to prevent regulatory creep.\nThe reform has the potential to produce cost savings for small firms in multiple ways, including reduction in capital requirements and potential reductions in the costs of regulatory reporting.3\nThe changes went into effect quickly. Legislation to make the change was introduced around the same time that Federal Reserve Governor Tarullo raised this reform option (around early November 2014).4 Congress passed legislation increasing the asset size of holding companies under the policy from $500 million to $1 billion, which the president signed on Dec. 18, 2014.\nI look forward to the Board of Governors continuing the rapid pace of implementation associated with this reform. In particular, I see benefits in extending the small holding company policy to some firms with assets of less than $10 billion. Some firms of that size are effectively large community banks, in terms of their overall risk profile. I am also encouraged by the seriousness with which the Federal Reserve and the other agencies are taking the regulatory review required under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 (EGRPRA). I encourage the Minnesota Bankers Association and all banks in the state of Minnesota and the Ninth Federal Reserve District to continue to provide suggestions on tailoring regulation for community banks under that review.\nBut regulation is not the only area for tailoring. A second fruitful approach to additional tailoring concerns supervision. I worry that our current supervisory methods establish expectations that are too detailed across too many areas of bank operations and too wide a swath of banks. Alternatively, supervisors could concentrate on a smaller number of activities that we believe are correlated with bad outcomes. To be specific, supervisors could choose to focus on rapid loan growth, high lending concentrations, specific high-risk types of lending and wholesale funding strategies, and curtail some of the more detailed reviews at lower-risk institutions. This shift in focus might generate higher returns to society, in terms of improved safety and soundness per dollar spent, than detailed work programs. To be clear: I’m suggesting a tailored approach, and so supervisors would retain the more comprehensive, proscriptive approach for larger, systemically important banks.\nConclusion\nLet me wrap up.\n2014 was an outstanding year from the point of view of employment growth. Nonetheless, as I emphasized in my discussion, the sluggish behavior of prices over the past few years suggests that there is room for further improvement. I expect inflation to remain below 2 percent for a few years. That outlook gives the FOMC plenty of headroom in which to use monetary policy stimulus to facilitate continued labor market improvement. Better tailoring of community bank supervision and regulation, of the kind that I discussed today, would also help promote our price and employment objectives.\nThanks for listening. I look forward to your questions.\nEndnotes\n1 Thanks to Ron Feldman, David Fettig, Terry Fitzgerald and Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for their assistance with these remarks.\n2 In speeches last month, I expressed some concerns about the reference policy rule contained in the proposed Federal Reserve Accountability and Transparency Act. I still have those concerns and will likely return to those themes in future remarks.\n3 Firms covered by the small bank holding company policy file holding company regulatory reports only twice a year instead of four times a year for firms not covered by the policy.\n4 See the speech by Governor Daniel K. Tarullo, “A Tiered Approach to Regulation and Supervision of Community Banks,” at the Community Bankers Symposium, Chicago, Nov. 7, 2014.\n\nNote1\n\nThanks for the introduction, and thank you for the invitation to join you here today.\n\nMy speech today has two distinct parts. The first part has to do with monetary policy. There has been a great deal of recent public conversation about Federal Reserve accountability with respect to monetary policy. I view my talk as being a natural outgrowth of that dialogue. American monetary policymakers like me are employees of the public. As I’ll describe, we are charged by the public’s representatives with achieving certain objectives. In keeping with this employer-employee relationship, my remarks loosely mimic a standard performance evaluation of the kind that takes place in corporations all over America each year. I first provide an assessment of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) performance over the past three years relative to the Committee’s monetary policy goals. I then turn to what I see as appropriate plans for the FOMC in 2015, given the Committee’s goals.\n\nMy remarks differ in a key respect from many or possibly most other discussions about the FOMC. It is common to focus on what actions the Committee has taken, such as our decisions about asset purchases or interest rates. In my view, these discussions about what has been done are really tangential to monetary policy accountability. Accountability—in any endeavor, including monetary policy—is not about what actions have been taken. Rather, it’s about the results those actions achieve—specifically, how well performance accords with the relevant objectives. Accordingly, my discussion of FOMC performance and plans is relentlessly goal-oriented.2\n\nThe second part of my speech has to do with community banks. It follows up on remarks that I made last year about improving supervision and regulation by tailoring rules and approaches to the actual risks posed by these entities. I’ll discuss some recent beneficial changes along these lines and suggest some opportunities for further improvements.\n\nAs I said, the second part of my speech is distinct from the first part about monetary policy. Nonetheless, I see them as entirely consistent with each other. In the first part, I will emphasize the need for monetary policy to achieve the macroeconomic goals set forth by Congress. In the second part, I will describe how tailoring of supervision and regulation can help facilitate the Federal Reserve’s pursuit of these same objectives. Throughout my remarks today, please keep in mind that I will be expressing my own views, and they are not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI look forward to responding to, and learning from, your questions at the conclusion of my remarks.\n\nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to set the path of interest rates over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. However, the Committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a rotating group of four other presidents. I’m not one of those four presidents this year. At FOMC meetings, we decide on the level of monetary stimulus for the economy. For now, I won’t get into too many details of what that term “monetary stimulus” means except to make two high-level points. First, when the FOMC changes the level of stimulus, our actions tend to push inflation—that is, the rate of growth of prices—and employment in the same direction. Raising the level of stimulus puts upward pressure on both inflation and employment. Lowering the level of stimulus puts downward pressure on both inflation and employment. Second, the FOMC’s actions only affect inflation and employment with a lag, usually thought to be about one-and-a-half to two years.\n\nWhat is the FOMC seeking to achieve by varying the level of monetary stimulus? Congress has charged the FOMC with making monetary policy to promote price stability and to promote maximum employment. The FOMC has interpreted the first goal, price stability, to mean keeping inflation close to 2 percent. The FOMC’s job is to vary monetary stimulus over time to meet these mandated objectives.\n\nWith that context, I now turn to an assessment of the FOMC’s evaluation over the past three years. I’ll begin by showing you data on FOMC performance with respect to its maximum employment mandate over the past three years.\n\nThe best known measure of labor market performance is the unemployment rate.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nIn December 2011, the unemployment rate was 8.5 percent. Since that date, the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.6 percent. The fall was especially rapid in 2014. However, the unemployment rate remains elevated compared to the FOMC’s assessments of its long-run value.\n\nThe unemployment rate is the most widely known measure of labor market performance. But there are good reasons to view it as only one of many useful labor market metrics. Recall that, to estimate the unemployment rate, the Census Bureau asks people two questions: Are you working? And, if not, have you looked for work in the past four weeks? The unemployment rate measures the ratio of the second number—the recent job searchers—to the sum of the two numbers (the recent job searchers and the workers). This means that the unemployment rate can decline for two reasons: because more people are finding work or because fewer people are looking for work. Much of the decline in the unemployment rate over the past three years has occurred because the fraction of people who are looking for work has fallen. This characterization is borne out if we look at the evolution of the fraction of people over the age of 16 who have a job—what’s called the employment-to-population ratio.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nIn December 2011, the employment-to-population ratio was 58.5 percent. It has risen, but only to 59.2 percent. Arithmetically, this means that people getting jobs accounts for well under one-half of the fall in the unemployment rate over the past three years.\n\nThe good news is that the employment-to-population ratio did grow markedly in the past year. And this increase is especially notable given underlying demographic trends. As the baby boom birth cohort—born between 1946 and 1964—ages, the fraction of retirees in the population grows steadily. This demographic force, in and of itself, would have led to a decline in the employment-to-population ratio over the past three years.\n\nOne simple way to adjust for this demographic impulse is to focus on people in their prime working-age years. Here, I’ve plotted the fraction of the population aged 25 to 54 who have a job.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nAgain, we have seen steady improvement in this fraction over the past three years. The rate of improvement was especially marked in the past year.\n\nOf course, just because someone has a job does not mean that they are necessarily fully employed. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports each month on the number of Americans who are working part time, would like to work more hours, but are unable to obtain those additional hours. That fraction of the labor force has fallen over the past three years.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nAll told, these charts document improvement in all of these measures of labor market performance over the past three years. And in all three measures, the rate of improvement was especially rapid in the past year.\n\nShould Americans view the FOMC’s performance with respect to the maximum employment mandate as being satisfactory? That’s a hard question to answer on the basis of these pictures alone. Employment growth is clearly better than no growth (or, worse, negative growth). But we are still left with the question: Should the FOMC have facilitated even faster employment growth? To answer this question, we need to examine the behavior of prices.\n\nAccordingly, I now turn to the FOMC’s performance relative to its price stability objective. As I noted earlier, operationally, the FOMC has translated this objective into keeping the rate of increase of the price level—that is, the inflation rate—close to 2 percent. Even more specifically, the FOMC uses what’s called the personal consumption expenditures (or PCE) price index to calculate inflation. This measure of inflation captures the rate of increase in all goods and services, including those related to food and energy.\n\nHere’s a graph of how PCE inflation has behaved over the past three years.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nI see three main take-aways from this picture. First, PCE inflation has averaged 1.3 percent per year since December 2011. This is well under the FOMC’s 2 percent target. Second, PCE inflation has been below 2 percent for a long time—over two-and-a-half years. Finally, there was little pickup in inflation last year.\n\nThe American public should certainly not expect the FOMC to hit its inflation target every month. But two-and-a-half years is a long time. The FOMC’s performance in terms of price stability can be summarized pretty simply: The Committee has not provided sufficient stimulus to hit its inflation target.\n\nThis persistent underrun of the inflation target creates a risk to the credibility of the Committee’s target. For monetary policy to be effective, it is critical that investors and other members of the public believe that the FOMC is in fact aiming at 2 percent inflation, and not at some higher or lower figure. Persistent deviations from the target may weaken those beliefs.\n\nRecently, there have been signs of exactly this kind of reduction in FOMC credibility in financial market data. Here, we’ve plotted the behavior of two market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nThe main take-away is that both of these metrics have drifted downward over the past three years. Indeed, they have fallen especially sharply in the past few months. The FOMC, so far, has largely failed to take substantial policy action in response to these declines. That lack of a response creates additional downside risk to the credibility of the 2 percent inflation target.\n\nI close my discussion of price stability by circling back to a question about the employment mandate that I posed earlier: Should the FOMC have stimulated more rapid employment growth? The data on inflation suggest an answer to this question. Recall that monetary stimulus pushes both employment and prices in the same direction. By providing somewhat more stimulus, the FOMC could have stimulated at least somewhat more employment growth, without creating undue inflation. I am sure that this faster employment growth would have been welcomed by the American public. So, even though employment grew, it seems that there was an improvement opportunity: The FOMC should have facilitated even faster employment growth.\n\nMy summary assessment is that the FOMC underperformed in the past three years with respect to the price stability mandate and the employment mandate. I’m sometimes asked, “What concrete actions could the FOMC have taken to provide additional stimulus?” I think one concrete action would have been not to reduce stimulus. In mid-2013, the FOMC began communicating about the eventual elimination of its asset purchase program that took place from December 2013 and October 2014. These communications, and the follow-up actions, served as a tightening of monetary policy. Accordingly, they were associated with sharp increases in market interest rates and sharp reductions in the rate of home mortgage refinancing.\n\nI’ve discussed FOMC performance over the past three years relative to the FOMC’s objectives. I now want to turn to the question of how I believe monetary policy stimulus should evolve over the coming year so as to best achieve the FOMC’s objectives. I will focus on the particular issue of how the FOMC should adjust the target range for the fed funds rate—the short-term interbank lending rate. As has been true for over six years, the target range is currently set between zero and a quarter percentage point. The main issue facing the Committee is: Should that target range be raised soon?\n\nTo answer this question, I find it helpful to return to my earlier analogy of a corporate performance evaluation. Many employees in America are evaluated in terms of their performance with respect to pre-assigned goals. They are given a great deal of latitude in terms of how to make choices that will achieve those objectives. The best employees, of course, are the ones who consistently use that flexibility to optimize their success with respect to their pre-assigned goals.\n\nThe FOMC—an employee of the public—also enjoys a great deal of latitude. To be a good employee, it should use that latitude to optimize its success with respect to achieving its macroeconomic goals. This goal-oriented approach to monetary policywould focus on keeping the economy as close as possible to the FOMC’s objectives for prices and employment.\n\nA goal-oriented approach has sharp implications for near-term monetary policy decisions. My own current assessment is that it will take a few years for inflation to return to 2 percent from its current low level. As I noted earlier, monetary policy affects prices with about a two-year lag. Raising the target range for the fed funds rate in 2015 would only further retard the pace of the slow recovery in inflation. It would also increase the risk of a loss of credibility, in the sense that the public could increasingly perceive the FOMC as aiming at a lower inflation target. Hence, given my current outlook for inflation, I anticipate that, under a goal-oriented approach, the FOMC would not raise the fed funds rate target this year.\n\nDeciding not to reduce stimulus in 2015 would also be consistent with a goal-oriented approach to the employment mandate. Increases in stimulus would push upward on employment. Such an increase in employment is entirely consistent with the pursuit of maximum employment that Congress has mandated for the FOMC.\n\nAdmittedly, there has been considerable skepticism over the course of the past five years about the ability of monetary or fiscal policy to stimulate employment growth. I have expressed some of those concerns myself on occasion. But look at how rapidly employment actually grew in 2014! The job market is—finally—on a highly desirable upward trajectory. We are more likely to continue on that welcome trajectory if the FOMC does not tighten monetary policy in 2015.\n\nIn the rest of the talk, I will turn my attention to community banks. I see community banks as playing an important role in promoting the price and employment goals of the Federal Reserve. Supervision and regulation of these entities is, of course, necessary to mitigate the risk of taxpayer loss. But it is also necessary for the supervisory and regulatory framework to be appropriately structured to allow community banks to fulfill their necessary economic function.\n\nI will build on remarks I made in the summer of 2014, where I discussed the need to better tailor supervision and regulation to the risks actually posed by community banks.

The Federal Reserve Accountability and Transparency Act (or FRAT Act) would require the FOMC to tell Congress and the public how the Committee plans to change the level of monetary accommodation in response to macroeconomic developments. A key element of the FRAT Act is a reference policy rule that would be intended to serve as a baseline for this communication. The rule frames accountability in terms of what choices the Committee is making, as opposed to how the macroeconomy is performing relative to FOMC objectives. In my discussion, I’ll explain how this approach to accountability means that the reference policy rule in the FRAT Act would be likely to degrade, rather than enhance, the FOMC’s ability to achieve its objectives.\nThroughout my remarks today, please keep in mind that I will be expressing my own views, and they are not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nI look forward to responding to, and learning from, your questions at the conclusion of my remarks.\nFederal Reserve System objectives\nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to set the path of interest rates over the next six to seven weeks.

Rather, they are imputed from the prices of particular financial assets. They use those prices to construct measures of inflation expectations five to 10 years hence. Thus, the measure in late 2014 captures inflation expectations for the period 2019-2024. By looking this far ahead in time, we can strip away temporary, short-run influences on the economy and focus on market participants’ beliefs about the FOMC’s future intentions.\nThe main take-away is that both of these metrics have drifted downward over the past three years.

The data on inflation suggest an answer to this question. Recall that monetary stimulus pushes both employment and prices in the same direction. By providing somewhat more stimulus, the FOMC could have stimulated at least somewhat more employment growth, without creating undue inflation. I am sure that this faster employment growth would have been welcomed by the American public. So, even though employment grew, it seems that there was an improvement opportunity: The FOMC should have facilitated even faster employment growth.\nMy summary assessment is that the FOMC underperformed in the past three years with respect to the price stability mandate and the employment mandate. I’m sometimes asked, “What concrete actions could the FOMC have taken to provide additional stimulus?” I think one concrete action would have been not to reduce stimulus. In mid-2013, the FOMC began communicating about the eventual elimination of its asset purchase program that took place from December 2013 and October 2014. These communications, and the follow-up actions, served as a tightening of monetary policy. Accordingly, they were associated with sharp increases in market interest rates and sharp reductions in the rate of home mortgage refinancing.\nFuture choices\nI’ve discussed FOMC performance over the past three years relative to the FOMC’s objectives. I now want to turn to the question of how I believe monetary policy stimulus should evolve over the coming year so as to best achieve the FOMC’s objectives. I will focus on the particular issue of how the FOMC should adjust the target range for the fed funds rate—the short-term interbank lending rate. As has been true for over six years, that target range is currently set between zero and a quarter percentage point. The main issue facing the Committee is: Should that target range be raised soon?\nI’ll first answer this question using a reference policy rule that is contained in the FRAT Act that is under consideration by Congress. I’ll explain why I believe that this answer may be misleading. I’ll then turn to another approach that I view as more reliable.\nReference policy rule\nThe FRAT Act contains a description of a specific reference policy rule for the FOMC. I’ve depicted that reference policy rule on this slide.\nLarge chart\nThe reference policy rule describes how the Fed should set its target for the fed funds rate, given recent observations on inflation and real gross domestic product (GDP). Note that the rule relies on an estimate of potential real GDP. I’m not going to get into what that complicated term means. I’ll just note that, unlike real GDP itself, there is considerable disagreement among economists about how to measure potential real GDP. My own estimate is that real GDP is about 2 percent below potential real GDP. With this estimate of potential real GDP, the reference policy rule implies that the FOMC should set the target fed funds rate equal to about 2 percent—about 200 basis points higher than its current level.1 In other words, the reference policy rule recommends that the FOMC should be following a much tighter monetary policy.\nBut there are, I believe, good reasons to be skeptical about this recommendation. Clause 9(D) of Section 2c of the FRAT Act has a single word, “two.” This word refers to what macroeconomists call the natural real rate of interest—essentially, the interest rate, net of inflation, that is expected to prevail in normal economic times. For many years before the financial crisis, the natural real rate of interest did seem to be in the vicinity of 2 percent. Most macroeconomists agree, though, that the natural real rate of interest is not fixed (at “two” or anything else) over time. If businesses are particularly uncertain about future tax policy, they’ll all want to save rather than invest in new projects. That extra demand for savings will push down on the natural real rate of interest. If households are particularly uncertain about their future incomes, they’ll want to save rather than spend. Again, that extra demand for savings will push down on the natural real rate of interest. If banks are ordered by their regulators to hold large amounts of government bonds, that will push down on the natural real rate of interest. All of these forces suggest that the natural real rate of interest is lower now than in the past—and therefore lower than “two,” which means that monetary policy should be more accommodative than is implied by the reference policy rule.\nTo be clear, the proposed legislation allows for the FOMC to deviate from the reference policy rule. However, the legislation views deviations from the reference policy rule as being undesirable. (In particular, it requires the FOMC to provide Congress with a “detailed justification” for any departure from the reference policy rule “within 48 hours.”) My point is that this perspective is flawed, because the reference policy rule does not allow for the possibility that the natural real rate of interest varies over time.\nGoal-oriented monetary policy\nI’ve argued that basing policy choices on the reference policy rule enshrined in the FRAT Act is likely to lead to undesirable outcomes. But how else should the FOMC decide on its appropriate policy choices? To answer this question, I find it helpful to return to my earlier analogy of a corporate performance evaluation. Many employees in America are evaluated in terms of their performance with respect to pre-assigned goals. They are given a great deal of latitude in terms of how to make choices that will achieve those objectives. The best employees, of course, are the ones that consistently use that flexibility to optimize their success with respect to their pre-assigned goals.\nThe FOMC—an employee of the public—also enjoys a great deal of latitude. To be a good employee, it should use that latitude to optimize its success with respect to achieving its macroeconomic goals. This goal-oriented approach to monetary policy would focus on keeping the economy as close as possible to the FOMC’s objectives for prices and employment.\nA goal-oriented approach has sharp implications for near-term monetary policy decisions. My own current assessment is that it will take a few years for inflation to return to 2 percent from its current low level. As I noted earlier, monetary policy affects prices with about a two-year lag. Raising the target range for the fed funds rate in 2015 would only further retard the pace of the slow recovery in inflation. It would also increase the risk of a loss of credibility, in the sense that the public could increasingly perceive the FOMC as aiming at a lower inflation target. Hence, given my current outlook for inflation, I anticipate that, under a goal-oriented approach, the FOMC would not raise the fed funds rate target this year.\nDeciding not to reduce stimulus in 2015 would also be consistent with a goal-oriented approach to the employment mandate. Increases in stimulus would push upward on employment. Such an increase in employment is entirely consistent with the pursuit of maximum employment that Congress has mandated for the FOMC.\nAdmittedly, there has been considerable skepticism over the course of the past five years about the ability of monetary or fiscal policy to stimulate employment growth. I have expressed some of those concerns myself on occasion. But look at how rapidly employment actually grew in 2014! The job market is—finally—on a highly desirable upward trajectory. We are more likely to continue on that welcome trajectory if the FOMC does not tighten monetary policy in 2015.\nConclusion\nThe Federal Reserve has been given a lot of latitude by Congress. But that independence is to serve a purpose—to allow the Federal Reserve to achieve key macroeconomic objectives. We are ultimately accountable, for our performance relative to those goals, to the public and its representatives. I have loosely modeled my remarks today on a standard corporate performance evaluation in order to facilitate that accountability.\nMore specifically, I have provided an assessment of the FOMC’s performance, relative to its macroeconomic objectives, over the past three years. That assessment suggested that the FOMC did not provide sufficient accommodation during that time period. There are troubling signs that the credibility of the FOMC’s inflation target may have fallen somewhat as a result. I discussed the possibility that the FOMC might raise the target range for the fed funds rate in 2015. I explained how, according to my current outlook, such an increase would only cause the FOMC to fall further short of its objectives.\nThanks for listening. I look forward to your questions.\nNote\n* Thanks to David Fettig, Terry Fitzgerald, Rob Grunewald and Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for their assistance with these remarks.\nEndnote\n1 This argument abstracts from the stimulative effects being provided by the FOMC’s considerable holdings of longer-term assets. Taking those effects into account would imply that, according to the reference policy rule, the FOMC’s target for the fed funds rate should be higher than 200 basis points.\n\nNote*\n\nThanks for the introduction, and thank you for the invitation to join you here today.\n\nThere has been a great deal of recent public conversation about Federal Reserve accountability with respect to monetary policy. I view my talk today as being a natural outgrowth of that dialogue. American monetary policymakers like me are employees of the public. As I’ll describe, we are charged by the public’s representatives with achieving certain objectives. In keeping with this employer-employee relationship, my remarks to the public this evening loosely mimic a standard performance evaluation of the kind that takes place in corporations all over America each year. I first provide an assessment of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) performance over the past three years relative to the Committee’s monetary policy goals. I then turn to what I see as appropriate plans for the FOMC in 2015, given the Committee’s goals.\n\nMy remarks differ in a key respect from many or possibly most other discussions about the FOMC. It is common to focus on what actions the Committee has taken, such as our decisions about asset purchases or interest rates. In my view, these discussions about what has been done are really tangential to monetary policy accountability. Accountability—in any endeavor, including monetary policy—is not about what actions have been taken. Rather, it’s about the results those actions achieve—specifically, how well performance accords with the relevant objectives. Accordingly, my discussion of FOMC performance and plans is relentlessly goal-oriented.\n\nMy goal-oriented approach to FOMC accountability differs from the approach taken in legislation about monetary policy accountability that is currently under consideration by Congress. The Federal Reserve Accountability and Transparency Act (or FRAT Act) would require the FOMC to tell Congress and the public how the Committee plans to change the level of monetary accommodation in response to macroeconomic developments. A key element of the FRAT Act is a reference policy rule that would be intended to serve as a baseline for this communication. The rule frames accountability in terms of what choices the Committee is making, as opposed to how the macroeconomy is performing relative to FOMC objectives. In my discussion, I’ll explain how this approach to accountability means that the reference policy rule in the FRAT Act would be likely to degrade, rather than enhance, the FOMC’s ability to achieve its objectives.\n\nThroughout my remarks today, please keep in mind that I will be expressing my own views, and they are not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI look forward to responding to, and learning from, your questions at the conclusion of my remarks.\n\nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to set the path of interest rates over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. However, the Committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a rotating group of four other presidents. I’m not one of those four presidents this year. At FOMC meetings, we decide on the level of monetary stimulus for the economy. For now, I won’t get into too many details of what that term “monetary stimulus” means except to make two high-level points. First, when the FOMC changes the level of stimulus, our actions tend to push inflation—that is, the rate of growth of prices—and employment in the same direction. Raising the level of stimulus puts upward pressure on both inflation and employment. Lowering the level of stimulus puts downward pressure on both inflation and employment. Second, the FOMC’s actions only affect inflation and employment with a lag, usually thought to be about one-and-a-half to two years.\n\nWhat is the FOMC seeking to achieve by varying the level of monetary stimulus? Congress has charged the FOMC with making monetary policy to promote price stability and to promote maximum employment. The FOMC has interpreted the first goal, price stability, to mean keeping inflation close to 2 percent. The FOMC’s job is to vary monetary stimulus over time to meet these mandated objectives.\n\nWith that context, I now turn to an assessment of the FOMC’s performance over the past three years. I’ll begin by showing you data on FOMC performance with respect to its maximum employment mandate over the past three years.\n\nThe best known measure of labor market performance is the unemployment rate.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nIn December 2011, the unemployment rate was 8.5 percent. Since that date, the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.6 percent. The fall was especially rapid in 2014. However, the unemployment rate remains elevated compared to the FOMC’s assessments of its long-run value.\n\nThe unemployment rate is the most widely known measure of labor market performance. But there are good reasons to view it as only one of many useful labor market metrics. Recall that, to estimate the unemployment rate, the Census Bureau asks people two questions: Are you working? And, if not, have you looked for work in the past four weeks? The unemployment rate measures the ratio of the second number—the recent job searchers—to the sum of the two numbers (the recent job searchers and the workers). This means that the unemployment rate can decline for two reasons: because more people are finding work or because fewer people are looking for work. Much of the decline in the unemployment rate over the past three years has occurred because the fraction of people who are looking for work has fallen. This characterization is borne out if we look at the evolution of the fraction of people over the age of 16 who have a job—what’s called the employment-to-population ratio.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nIn December 2011, the employment-to-population ratio was 58.6 percent. It has risen, but only to 59.2 percent. Arithmetically, this means that people getting jobs accounts for well under one-half of the fall in the unemployment rate over the past three years.\n\nThe good news is that the employment-to-population ratio did grow markedly in the past year.\n\nAnd this increase is especially notable given underlying demographic trends. As the baby boom birth cohort—born between 1946 and 1964—ages, the fraction of retirees in the population grows steadily. This demographic force, in and of itself, would have led to a decline in the employment-to-population ratio over the past three years.\n\nOne simple way to adjust for this demographic impulse is to focus on people in their prime working-age years. Here, I’ve plotted the fraction of the population aged 25 to 54 who have a job.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nAgain, we have seen steady improvement in this fraction over the past three years. The rate of improvement was especially marked in the past year.\n\nOf course, just because someone has a job does not mean that they are necessarily fully employed. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports each month on the number of Americans who are working part time, would like to work more hours, but are unable to obtain those additional hours. That fraction of the labor force has fallen over the past three years.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nAll told, these charts document improvement in all of these measures of labor market performance over the past three years. And in all three measures, the rate of improvement was especially rapid in the last year.\n\nShould Americans view the FOMC’s performance with respect to the maximum employment mandate as being satisfactory? That’s a hard question to answer on the basis of these pictures alone. Employment growth is clearly better than no growth (or, worse, negative growth). But we are still left with the question: Should the FOMC have facilitated even faster employment growth? To answer this question, we need to examine the behavior of prices.\n\nAccordingly, I now turn to the FOMC’s performance relative to its price stability objective. As I noted earlier, operationally, the FOMC has translated this objective into keeping the rate of increase of the price level—that is, the inflation rate—close to 2 percent. Even more specifically, the FOMC uses what’s called the personal consumption expenditures (or PCE) price index to calculate inflation. This measure of inflation captures the rate of increase in all goods and services, including those related to food and energy.\n\nHere’s a graph of how PCE inflation has behaved over the past three years.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nI see three main take-aways from this picture. First, PCE inflation has averaged (less than) 1.3 percent per year since December 2011. This is well under the FOMC’s 2 percent target. Second, PCE inflation has been below 2 percent for a long time—over two-and-a-half years. Finally, there was little pickup in inflation last year.\n\nThe American public should certainly not expect the FOMC to hit its inflation target every month. But two-and-a-half years is a long time. The FOMC’s performance in terms of price stability can be summarized pretty simply: The Committee has not provided sufficient stimulus to hit its inflation target.\n\nThis persistent underrun of the inflation target creates a risk to the credibility of the Committee’s target. For monetary policy to be effective, it is critical that investors and other members of the public believe that the FOMC is in fact aiming at 2 percent inflation, and not at some higher or lower figure. Persistent deviations from the target may weaken those beliefs.\n\nRecently, there have been signs of exactly this kind of reduction in FOMC credibility in financial market data. Here, we’ve plotted the behavior of two market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nThese series are not based on surveys. Rather, they are imputed from the prices of particular financial assets. They use those prices to construct measures of inflation expectations five to 10 years hence. Thus, the measure in late 2014 captures inflation expectations for the period 2019-2024. By looking this far ahead in time, we can strip away temporary, short-run influences on the economy and focus on market participants’ beliefs about the FOMC’s future intentions.\n\nThe main take-away is that both of these metrics have drifted downward over the past three years. Indeed, they have fallen especially sharply in the past few months. The FOMC, so far, has largely failed to take substantial policy action in response to these declines. That lack of a response creates additional downside risk to the credibility of the 2 percent inflation target.\n\nI close my discussion of price stability by circling back to a question about the employment mandate that I posed earlier: Should the FOMC have stimulated more rapid employment growth? The data on inflation suggest an answer to this question. Recall that monetary stimulus pushes both employment and prices in the same direction. By providing somewhat more stimulus, the FOMC could have stimulated at least somewhat more employment growth, without creating undue inflation. I am sure that this faster employment growth would have been welcomed by the American public. So, even though employment grew, it seems that there was an improvement opportunity: The FOMC should have facilitated even faster employment growth.\n\nMy summary assessment is that the FOMC underperformed in the past three years with respect to the price stability mandate and the employment mandate. I’m sometimes asked, “What concrete actions could the FOMC have taken to provide additional stimulus?” I think one concrete action would have been not to reduce stimulus. In mid-2013, the FOMC began communicating about the eventual elimination of its asset purchase program that took place from December 2013 and October 2014. These communications, and the follow-up actions, served as a tightening of monetary policy. Accordingly, they were associated with sharp increases in market interest rates and sharp reductions in the rate of home mortgage refinancing.\n\nI’ve discussed FOMC performance over the past three years relative to the FOMC’s objectives. I now want to turn to the question of how I believe monetary policy stimulus should evolve over the coming year so as to best achieve the FOMC’s objectives. I will focus on the particular issue of how the FOMC should adjust the target range for the fed funds rate—the short-term interbank lending rate. As has been true for over six years, that target range is currently set between zero and a quarter percentage point. The main issue facing the Committee is: Should that target range be raised soon?\n\nI’ll first answer this question using a reference policy rule that is contained in the FRAT Act that is under consideration by Congress.

The FOMC has interpreted the first goal, price stability, to mean keeping inflation close to 2 percent.

I’ll begin by showing you data on FOMC performance with respect to its maximum employment mandate over the past three years.\nThe best known measure of labor market performance is the unemployment rate.\nLarge chart\nIn December 2011, the unemployment rate was 8.5 percent.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports each month on the number of Americans who are working part time, would like to work more hours, but are unable to obtain those additional hours. That fraction of the labor force has fallen over the past three years.\nLarge chart\nAll told, these charts document improvement in all of these measures of labor market performance over the past three years. And in all three measures, the rate of improvement was especially rapid in the last year.\nShould Americans view the FOMC’s performance with respect to the maximum employment mandate as being satisfactory? That’s a hard question to answer on the basis of these pictures alone. Employment growth is clearly better than no growth (or, worse, negative growth). But we are still left with the question: Should the FOMC have facilitated even faster employment growth? To answer this question, we need to examine the behavior of prices.\nPrice stability\nAccordingly, I now turn to the FOMC’s performance relative to its price stability objective. As I noted earlier, operationally, the FOMC has translated this objective into keeping the rate of increase of the price level—that is, the inflation rate—close to 2 percent. Even more specifically, the FOMC uses what’s called the personal consumption expenditures (or PCE) price index to calculate inflation. This measure of inflation captures the rate of increase in all goods and services, including those related to food and energy.\nHere’s a graph of how PCE inflation has behaved over the past three years.\nLarge chart\nI see three main take-aways from this picture. First, PCE inflation has averaged (less than) 1.3 percent per year since December 2011. This is well under the FOMC’s 2 percent target. Second, PCE inflation has been below 2 percent for a long time—over two-and-a-half years. Finally, there was little pickup in inflation last year.\nThe American public should certainly not expect the FOMC to hit its inflation target every month. But two-and-a-half years is a long time. The FOMC’s performance in terms of price stability can be summarized pretty simply: The Committee has not provided sufficient stimulus to hit its inflation target.\nThis persistent underrun of the inflation target creates a risk to the credibility of the Committee’s target. For monetary policy to be effective, it is critical that investors and other members of the public believe that the FOMC is in fact aiming at 2 percent inflation, and not at some higher or lower figure. Persistent deviations from the target may weaken those beliefs.\nRecently, there have been signs of exactly this kind of reduction in FOMC credibility in financial market data. Here, we’ve plotted the behavior of two market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations.\nLarge chart\nThese series are not based on surveys. Rather, they are imputed from the prices of particular financial assets. They use those prices to construct measures of inflation expectations five to 10 years hence. Thus, the measure in late 2014 captures inflation expectations for the period 2019-2024. By looking this far ahead in time, we can strip away temporary, short-run influences on the economy and focus on market participants’ beliefs about the FOMC’s future intentions.\nThe main take-away is that both of these metrics have drifted downward over the past three years. Indeed, they have fallen especially sharply in the past few months. The FOMC, so far, has largely failed to take substantial policy action in response to these declines. That lack of a response creates additional downside risk to the credibility of the 2 percent inflation target.\nI close my discussion of price stability by circling back to a question about the employment mandate that I posed earlier: Should the FOMC have stimulated more rapid employment growth? The data on inflation suggest an answer to this question. Recall that monetary stimulus pushes both employment and prices in the same direction. By providing somewhat more stimulus, the FOMC could have stimulated at least somewhat more employment growth, without creating undue inflation. I am sure that this faster employment growth would have been welcomed by the American public. So, even though employment grew, it seems that there was an improvement opportunity: The FOMC should have facilitated even faster employment growth.\nMy summary assessment is that the FOMC underperformed in the past three years with respect to the price stability mandate and the employment mandate. I’m sometimes asked, “What concrete actions could the FOMC have taken to provide additional stimulus?” I think one concrete action would have been not to reduce stimulus. In mid-2013, the FOMC began communicating about the eventual elimination of its asset purchase program that took place from December 2013 and October 2014. These communications, and the follow-up actions, served as a tightening of monetary policy. Accordingly, they were associated with sharp increases in market interest rates and sharp reductions in the rate of home mortgage refinancing.\nFuture choices\nI’ve discussed FOMC performance over the past three years relative to the FOMC’s objectives. I now want to turn to the question of how I believe monetary policy stimulus should evolve over the coming year so as to best achieve the FOMC’s objectives. I will focus on the particular issue of how the FOMC should adjust the target range for the fed funds rate—the short-term interbank lending rate. As has been true for over six years, that target range is currently set between zero and a quarter percentage point. The main issue facing the Committee is: Should that target range be raised soon?\nI’ll first answer this question using a reference policy rule that is contained in the FRAT Act that is under consideration by Congress. I’ll explain why I believe that this answer may be misleading. I’ll then turn to another approach that I view as more reliable.\nReference policy rule\nThe FRAT Act contains a description of a specific reference policy rule for the FOMC. I’ve depicted that reference policy rule on this slide.\nLarge chart\nThe reference policy rule describes how the Fed should set its target for the fed funds rate, given recent observations on inflation and real gross domestic product (GDP). Note that the rule relies on an estimate of potential real GDP. I’m not going to get into what that complicated term means. I’ll just note that, unlike real GDP itself, there is considerable disagreement among economists about how to measure potential real GDP. My own estimate is that real GDP is about 2 percent below potential real GDP. With this estimate of potential real GDP, the reference policy rule implies that the FOMC should set the target fed funds rate equal to about 2 percent—about 200 basis points higher than its current level.1 In other words, the reference policy rule recommends that the FOMC should be following a much tighter monetary policy.\nBut there are, I believe, good reasons to be skeptical about this recommendation. Clause 9(D) of Section 2c of the FRAT Act has a single word, “two.” This word refers to what macroeconomists call the natural real rate of interest—essentially, the interest rate, net of inflation, that is expected to prevail in normal economic times. For many years before the financial crisis, the natural real rate of interest did seem to be in the vicinity of 2 percent. Most macroeconomists agree, though, that the natural real rate of interest is not fixed (at “two” or anything else) over time. If businesses are particularly uncertain about future tax policy, they’ll all want to save rather than invest in new projects. That extra demand for savings will push down on the natural real rate of interest. If households are particularly uncertain about their future incomes, they’ll want to save rather than spend. Again, that extra demand for savings will push down on the natural real rate of interest. If banks are ordered by their regulators to hold large amounts of government bonds, that will push down on the natural real rate of interest. All of these forces suggest that the natural real rate of interest is lower now than in the past—and therefore lower than “two,” which means that monetary policy should be more accommodative than is implied by the reference policy rule.\nTo be clear, the proposed legislation allows for the FOMC to deviate from the reference policy rule. However, the legislation views deviations from the reference policy rule as being undesirable. (In particular, it requires the FOMC to provide Congress with a “detailed justification” for any departure from the reference policy rule “within 48 hours.”) My point is that this perspective is flawed, because the reference policy rule does not allow for the possibility that the natural real rate of interest varies over time.\nGoal-oriented monetary policy\nI’ve argued that basing policy choices on the reference policy rule enshrined in the FRAT Act is likely to lead to undesirable outcomes. But how else should the FOMC decide on its appropriate policy choices? To answer this question, I find it helpful to return to my earlier analogy of a corporate performance evaluation. Many employees in America are evaluated in terms of their performance with respect to pre-assigned goals. They are given a great deal of latitude in terms of how to make choices that will achieve those objectives. The best employees, of course, are the ones that consistently use that flexibility to optimize their success with respect to their pre-assigned goals.\nThe FOMC—an employee of the public—also enjoys a great deal of latitude. To be a good employee, it should use that latitude to optimize its success with respect to achieving its macroeconomic goals. This goal-oriented approach to monetary policy would focus on keeping the economy as close as possible to the FOMC’s objectives for prices and employment.\nA goal-oriented approach has sharp implications for near-term monetary policy decisions. My own current assessment is that it will take a few years for inflation to return to 2 percent from its current low level. As I noted earlier, monetary policy affects prices with about a two-year lag. Raising the target range for the fed funds rate in 2015 would only further retard the pace of the slow recovery in inflation. It would also increase the risk of a loss of credibility, in the sense that the public could increasingly perceive the FOMC as aiming at a lower inflation target. Hence, given my current outlook for inflation, I anticipate that, under a goal-oriented approach, the FOMC would not raise the fed funds rate target this year.\nDeciding not to reduce stimulus in 2015 would also be consistent with a goal-oriented approach to the employment mandate. Increases in stimulus would push upward on employment. Such an increase in employment is entirely consistent with the pursuit of maximum employment that Congress has mandated for the FOMC.\nAdmittedly, there has been considerable skepticism over the course of the past five years about the ability of monetary or fiscal policy to stimulate employment growth. I have expressed some of those concerns myself on occasion. But look at how rapidly employment actually grew in 2014! The job market is—finally—on a highly desirable upward trajectory. We are more likely to continue on that welcome trajectory if the FOMC does not tighten monetary policy in 2015.\nConclusion\nThe Federal Reserve has been given a lot of latitude by Congress. But that independence is to serve a purpose—to allow the Federal Reserve to achieve key macroeconomic objectives. We are ultimately accountable, for our performance relative to those goals, to the public and its representatives. I have loosely modeled my remarks today on a standard corporate performance evaluation in order to facilitate that accountability.\nMore specifically, I have provided an assessment of the FOMC’s performance, relative to its macroeconomic objectives, over the past three years. That assessment suggested that the FOMC did not provide sufficient accommodation during that time period. There are troubling signs that the credibility of the FOMC’s inflation target may have fallen somewhat as a result. I discussed the possibility that the FOMC might raise the target range for the fed funds rate in 2015. I explained how, according to my current outlook, such an increase would only cause the FOMC to fall further short of its objectives.\nThanks for listening. I look forward to your questions.\nNote\n* Thanks to David Fettig, Terry Fitzgerald, Rob Grunewald and Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for their assistance with these remarks.\nEndnote\n1 This argument abstracts from the stimulative effects being provided by the FOMC’s considerable holdings of longer-term assets. Taking those effects into account would imply that, according to the reference policy rule, the FOMC’s target for the fed funds rate should be higher than 200 basis points.\n\nNote*\n\nThanks for the introduction, and thank you for the invitation to join you here today.\n\nThere has been a great deal of recent public conversation about Federal Reserve accountability with respect to monetary policy. I view my talk today as being a natural outgrowth of that dialogue. American monetary policymakers like me are employees of the public. As I’ll describe, we are charged by the public’s representatives with achieving certain objectives. In keeping with this employer-employee relationship, my remarks to the public this evening loosely mimic a standard performance evaluation of the kind that takes place in corporations all over America each year. I first provide an assessment of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) performance over the past three years relative to the Committee’s monetary policy goals. I then turn to what I see as appropriate plans for the FOMC in 2015, given the Committee’s goals.\n\nMy remarks differ in a key respect from many or possibly most other discussions about the FOMC. It is common to focus on what actions the Committee has taken, such as our decisions about asset purchases or interest rates. In my view, these discussions about what has been done are really tangential to monetary policy accountability. Accountability—in any endeavor, including monetary policy—is not about what actions have been taken. Rather, it’s about the results those actions achieve—specifically, how well performance accords with the relevant objectives. Accordingly, my discussion of FOMC performance and plans is relentlessly goal-oriented.\n\nMy goal-oriented approach to FOMC accountability differs from the approach taken in legislation about monetary policy accountability that is currently under consideration by Congress. The Federal Reserve Accountability and Transparency Act (or FRAT Act) would require the FOMC to tell Congress and the public how the Committee plans to change the level of monetary accommodation in response to macroeconomic developments. A key element of the FRAT Act is a reference policy rule that would be intended to serve as a baseline for this communication. The rule frames accountability in terms of what choices the Committee is making, as opposed to how the macroeconomy is performing relative to FOMC objectives. In my discussion, I’ll explain how this approach to accountability means that the reference policy rule in the FRAT Act would be likely to degrade, rather than enhance, the FOMC’s ability to achieve its objectives.\n\nThroughout my remarks today, please keep in mind that I will be expressing my own views, and they are not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI look forward to responding to, and learning from, your questions at the conclusion of my remarks.\n\nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to set the path of interest rates over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. However, the Committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a rotating group of four other presidents. I’m not one of those four presidents this year. At FOMC meetings, we decide on the level of monetary stimulus for the economy. For now, I won’t get into too many details of what that term “monetary stimulus” means except to make two high-level points. First, when the FOMC changes the level of stimulus, our actions tend to push inflation—that is, the rate of growth of prices—and employment in the same direction. Raising the level of stimulus puts upward pressure on both inflation and employment. Lowering the level of stimulus puts downward pressure on both inflation and employment. Second, the FOMC’s actions only affect inflation and employment with a lag, usually thought to be about one-and-a-half to two years.\n\nWhat is the FOMC seeking to achieve by varying the level of monetary stimulus? Congress has charged the FOMC with making monetary policy to promote price stability and to promote maximum employment. The FOMC has interpreted the first goal, price stability, to mean keeping inflation close to 2 percent. The FOMC’s job is to vary monetary stimulus over time to meet these mandated objectives.\n\nWith that context, I now turn to an assessment of the FOMC’s performance over the past three years. I’ll begin by showing you data on FOMC performance with respect to its maximum employment mandate over the past three years.\n\nThe best known measure of labor market performance is the unemployment rate.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nIn December 2011, the unemployment rate was 8.5 percent. Since that date, the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.6 percent. The fall was especially rapid in 2014. However, the unemployment rate remains elevated compared to the FOMC’s assessments of its long-run value.\n\nThe unemployment rate is the most widely known measure of labor market performance. But there are good reasons to view it as only one of many useful labor market metrics. Recall that, to estimate the unemployment rate, the Census Bureau asks people two questions: Are you working? And, if not, have you looked for work in the past four weeks? The unemployment rate measures the ratio of the second number—the recent job searchers—to the sum of the two numbers (the recent job searchers and the workers). This means that the unemployment rate can decline for two reasons: because more people are finding work or because fewer people are looking for work. Much of the decline in the unemployment rate over the past three years has occurred because the fraction of people who are looking for work has fallen. This characterization is borne out if we look at the evolution of the fraction of people over the age of 16 who have a job—what’s called the employment-to-population ratio.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nIn December 2011, the employment-to-population ratio was 58.6 percent. It has risen, but only to 59.2 percent. Arithmetically, this means that people getting jobs accounts for well under one-half of the fall in the unemployment rate over the past three years.\n\nThe good news is that the employment-to-population ratio did grow markedly in the past year.\n\nAnd this increase is especially notable given underlying demographic trends. As the baby boom birth cohort—born between 1946 and 1964—ages, the fraction of retirees in the population grows steadily. This demographic force, in and of itself, would have led to a decline in the employment-to-population ratio over the past three years.\n\nOne simple way to adjust for this demographic impulse is to focus on people in their prime working-age years. Here, I’ve plotted the fraction of the population aged 25 to 54 who have a job.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nAgain, we have seen steady improvement in this fraction over the past three years. The rate of improvement was especially marked in the past year.\n\nOf course, just because someone has a job does not mean that they are necessarily fully employed. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports each month on the number of Americans who are working part time, would like to work more hours, but are unable to obtain those additional hours. That fraction of the labor force has fallen over the past three years.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nAll told, these charts document improvement in all of these measures of labor market performance over the past three years. And in all three measures, the rate of improvement was especially rapid in the last year.\n\nShould Americans view the FOMC’s performance with respect to the maximum employment mandate as being satisfactory? That’s a hard question to answer on the basis of these pictures alone. Employment growth is clearly better than no growth (or, worse, negative growth). But we are still left with the question: Should the FOMC have facilitated even faster employment growth?

            "content": "Thanks for joining us here tonight. The plan is for us to spend the bulk of our time answering your questions. However, I thought that it might be informative for me to kick things off with some remarks about monetary policy. I’ll begin with a discussion of monetary policy objectives. I’ll describe how the Federal Reserve has done relative to those objectives over the past three years. Then I’ll turn to a brief analysis of what I anticipate will be appropriate monetary policy choices in 2015, in terms of achieving those objectives. Throughout my remarks tonight, please keep in mind that I will be expressing my own views, and they are not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nFederal Reserve System objectives\nAs you have heard, I have the privilege of serving on the Federal Open Market Committee, the monetary policymaking arm of the Federal Reserve. At FOMC meetings, we decide on the level of monetary stimulus for the economy. For now, I won’t get into too many details of what that term “monetary stimulus” means except to make two high-level points. First, when the FOMC changes the level of stimulus, our actions tend to push inflation—that is, the rate of growth of prices—and employment in the same direction. Raising the level of stimulus puts upward pressure on both inflation and employment. Lowering the level of stimulus puts downward pressure on both inflation and employment. Second, the FOMC’s actions only affect inflation and employment with a lag, usually thought to be about one-and-a-half to two years.\nWhat is the FOMC seeking to achieve by varying the level of monetary stimulus? Congress has charged the FOMC with making monetary policy to promote price stability and to promote maximum employment. The FOMC has interpreted the first goal, price stability, to mean keeping inflation close to 2 percent. The FOMC’s job is to vary monetary stimulus over time to meet these mandated objectives.\nMaximum employment\nWith that context, I now turn to an assessment of the FOMC’s evaluation over the past three years. I’ll begin by showing you data on FOMC performance with respect to its maximum employment mandate over the past three years.\nThe best known measure of labor market performance is the unemployment rate.\nLarge chart \nIn December 2011, the unemployment rate was 8.5 percent. Since that date, the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.8 percent. The fall was especially rapid in 2014. However, the unemployment rate remains elevated compared to the FOMC’s assessments of its long-run value.\nShould Americans view the FOMC’s performance with respect to the maximum employment mandate as being satisfactory? That’s a hard question to answer on the basis of this picture for at least a couple of reasons. First, there are other labor market metrics besides the unemployment rate, and many of these other metrics depict less labor market improvement in the past three years. (All of the metrics agree, though, that labor markets improved markedly in 2014.)\nSecond, regardless of how much we believe labor markets have improved in the past three years, we are still left with the question: “Would it have been appropriate for the FOMC to make choices that would have facilitated even faster improvement in labor market conditions?” To answer this question, we need to turn to the behavior of prices.\nPrice stability\nAccordingly, I now turn to the FOMC’s performance relative to its price stability objective. As I noted earlier, the FOMC has translated this objective into keeping the rate of increase of the price level—that is, the inflation rate—close to 2 percent. Even more specifically, the FOMC uses what’s called the personal consumption expenditures price index, or PCE, to calculate inflation. This measure of inflation captures the rate of increase in all goods and services, including those related to food and energy.\nHere’s a graph of how PCE inflation has behaved over the past three years.\nLarge image\nI see three main take-aways from this picture. First, PCE inflation has averaged (less than) 1.4 percent per year over this time period. This is well under the FOMC’s 2 percent target. Second, PCE inflation has been below 2 percent for a long time—over two-and-a-half years. Finally, there was little pickup in inflation last year.\nThe American public should certainly not expect the FOMC to hit its inflation target every month. But two-and-a-half years is a long time. The FOMC’s performance in terms of price stability can be summarized pretty simply: The Committee has not provided sufficient stimulus to hit its inflation target.\nThis persistent underrun of the inflation target creates a risk to the credibility of the Committee. For monetary policy to be effective, it is critical that investors and other members of the public believe that the FOMC is in fact aiming at 2 percent inflation, and not at some higher or lower figure. Persistent deviations from that target may weaken those beliefs. Recently, there have been signs of exactly this kind of reduction in FOMC credibility in declines in longer-term inflation expectations based on financial market data. The FOMC, so far, has largely failed to take substantial policy action in response to these declines. That lack of a response creates additional downside risk to the credibility of the 2 percent inflation target.\nI close my discussion of price stability by circling back to a question about the employment mandate that I posed earlier: Should the FOMC have stimulated more rapid improvement in labor market conditions? The data on inflation suggest an answer to this question. Recall that monetary stimulus pushes both employment and prices in the same direction. By providing somewhat more stimulus, the FOMC could have stimulated at least somewhat faster improvement in labor market conditions, without creating undue inflation. I am sure that this faster improvement in labor market conditions would have been welcomed by the American public. So, even though the unemployment rate fell, it seems that there was an improvement opportunity: Given how low inflation was, the FOMC could have, and should have, facilitated even faster employment growth.\nFuture choices\nI’ve discussed FOMC performance over the past three years relative to the FOMC’s objectives. I now want to turn to the question of how I believe monetary policy stimulus should evolve over the coming year so as to best achieve the FOMC’s objectives. I will focus on the particular issue of how the FOMC should adjust the target range for the fed funds rate—the short-term interbank lending rate. As has been true for over six years, that target range is currently set between zero and a quarter percentage point. The main issue facing the Committee is this: Should that target range be raised soon?\nMy own current assessment is that it will take a few years for inflation to return to 2 percent from its current low level. As I noted earlier, monetary policy affects prices with roughly a two-year lag. Raising the target range for the fed funds rate in 2015 would only further retard the pace of the slow recovery in inflation. It would also increase the risk to the credibility of the FOMC’s inflation target, in the sense that the public could increasingly perceive the FOMC as aiming at a lower inflation rate. Hence, given my current outlook for inflation, the FOMC can best achieve its macroeconomic objectives by not raising the fed funds rate target this year.\nDeciding not to reduce stimulus in 2015 would also be appropriate in terms of the employment mandate. Increases in stimulus push upward on employment, and employment increases are always consistent with the pursuit of maximum employment that Congress has mandated for the FOMC.\nThanks for listening. And now, let’s turn to the real focus of this evening: your questions.\n\nThanks for joining us here tonight. The plan is for us to spend the bulk of our time answering your questions. However, I thought that it might be informative for me to kick things off with some remarks about monetary policy. I’ll begin with a discussion of monetary policy objectives. I’ll describe how the Federal Reserve has done relative to those objectives over the past three years. Then I’ll turn to a brief analysis of what I anticipate will be appropriate monetary policy choices in 2015, in terms of achieving those objectives. Throughout my remarks tonight, please keep in mind that I will be expressing my own views, and they are not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAs you have heard, I have the privilege of serving on the Federal Open Market Committee, the monetary policymaking arm of the Federal Reserve. At FOMC meetings, we decide on the level of monetary stimulus for the economy. For now, I won’t get into too many details of what that term “monetary stimulus” means except to make two high-level points. First, when the FOMC changes the level of stimulus, our actions tend to push inflation—that is, the rate of growth of prices—and employment in the same direction. Raising the level of stimulus puts upward pressure on both inflation and employment. Lowering the level of stimulus puts downward pressure on both inflation and employment. Second, the FOMC’s actions only affect inflation and employment with a lag, usually thought to be about one-and-a-half to two years.\n\nWhat is the FOMC seeking to achieve by varying the level of monetary stimulus? Congress has charged the FOMC with making monetary policy to promote price stability and to promote maximum employment. The FOMC has interpreted the first goal, price stability, to mean keeping inflation close to 2 percent. The FOMC’s job is to vary monetary stimulus over time to meet these mandated objectives.\n\nWith that context, I now turn to an assessment of the FOMC’s evaluation over the past three years. I’ll begin by showing you data on FOMC performance with respect to its maximum employment mandate over the past three years.\n\nThe best known measure of labor market performance is the unemployment rate.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nIn December 2011, the unemployment rate was 8.5 percent. Since that date, the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.8 percent. The fall was especially rapid in 2014. However, the unemployment rate remains elevated compared to the FOMC’s assessments of its long-run value.\n\nShould Americans view the FOMC’s performance with respect to the maximum employment mandate as being satisfactory? That’s a hard question to answer on the basis of this picture for at least a couple of reasons. First, there are other labor market metrics besides the unemployment rate, and many of these other metrics depict less labor market improvement in the past three years. (All of the metrics agree, though, that labor markets improved markedly in 2014.)\n\nSecond, regardless of how much we believe labor markets have improved in the past three years, we are still left with the question: “Would it have been appropriate for the FOMC to make choices that would have facilitated even faster improvement in labor market conditions?” To answer this question, we need to turn to the behavior of prices.\n\nAccordingly, I now turn to the FOMC’s performance relative to its price stability objective.

            "content": "Note*\nIntroduction\nThank you for that introduction and thank you for the invitation to join you here today.\nI’m planning to spend most of my time today talking about the objectives of monetary policy. As you will hear, the FOMC has made great progress in formulating, and communicating, the objectives of monetary policy to the public. I will discuss some of that progress and then move on to some ideas about how the Committee can make further improvements along these lines. I look forward to your questions, as well—I always learn a lot from Q&A sessions.\nBefore I start, though, I must remind you that the views I express today are my own and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\nFederal Reserve System Basics\nLet me begin with some basics about the Federal Reserve System. I like to tell people that the Fed is a uniquely American institution. What do I mean by that? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve Banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts and includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to make monetary policy. All 12 presidents of the regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. However, the Committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a rotating group of four other presidents. I’m one of those four presidents this year. In this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government, because representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations.\nThis basic federalist structure has a long history. In fact, this year is the centennial of the opening of the 12 Reserve Banks and the start of the work undertaken by the Federal Reserve System. It’s been a fascinating hundred years, with many twists and turns along the way. I’m sure that many of you have questions about that journey. The answers to all of your questions—and probably more—are on a website that the Fed has created at federalreservehistory.org. I encourage you to visit this site to learn more about the people, places and events that have shaped Federal Reserve history.\nI won’t say too much more about Fed history—perhaps to the relief of some of you!—but I do want to draw your attention to one of the things that I think has changed the most over the Federal Reserve’s history: our communication with the public. A hundred years ago, Congress created a system that was designed specifically so that the residents of Main Street would have a voice in monetary policy. Technology has changed a lot since 1914, and so the ways that we gather information from Main Street have changed. But this fact-finding is still an important part of the making of monetary policy. In my travels around the Ninth District, I often meet with local business leaders and citizens to gather exactly this kind of information.\nCommunication is a two-way street, however. During the past century, the Federal Reserve’s communications to the public about its monetary policy actions have also evolved greatly. The pace of change was especially rapid in the eight years under Chairman Bernanke’s leadership. So, as the Federal Reserve System plans for its second century, I would say that the importance of two-way communication is a key lesson from the System’s first century. In order for the Fed to continue to be effective, it needs to communicate its policy decisions transparently to the public. Conversely, it also needs the public’s input on how those policies are affecting them. Events like the one today are a key part of fostering that two-way communication.\nWith that background in mind, let me turn back to the FOMC and the making of monetary policy. I mentioned that the FOMC meets eight times per year. At those meetings, we decide on the level of monetary stimulus for the economy. I won’t get into too many details of what that term “monetary stimulus” means, although I’m more than happy to take questions about it later. For now, I’ll just note that when the FOMC changes the level of stimulus, our actions tend to push inflation—that is, the rate of growth of prices—and employment in the same direction. Raising the level of stimulus puts upward pressure on both inflation and employment. Lowering the level of stimulus puts downward pressure on both inflation and employment.\nI can now turn to the main theme of the remainder of my speech: the goals that the FOMC seeks to achieve by varying the level of monetary stimulus.\nCongressional Mandates\nThe natural starting point for our discussion of monetary policy goals is the Federal Reserve Act, the law in which Congress created the Fed and defined its purposes. Through the Federal Reserve Act, Congress requires the Federal Reserve to make monetary policy so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates. Most economists believe that if the Fed achieved the first two mandates (maximum employment and stable prices), it would automatically achieve the third (moderate long-term interest rates). Hence, monetary policymakers in the United States are usually described as having a dual mandate: to promote price stability and maximum employment.\nCongress’ short overarching description of Federal Reserve objectives is the foundation for current monetary policymaking, but it does not address many specifics. In January 2012, in a key milestone in the evolution of the Fed’s communications, the FOMC adopted a longer and more precise description of its long-run goals. I’ll call this short but pathbreaking document the “framework statement.” It contains a number of important ideas—and indeed I encourage all Americans to read the entire statement—but I’ll stress three main elements.\nThe first element is that the framework statement explicitly translates the words “price stability” into a longer-run goal of a 2 percent annual inflation rate. Here, the term “inflation rate” refers specifically to the personal consumption expenditures (or PCE) inflation rate. This is a measure of the rate of increase in the prices of all goods and services, including those related to food and energy. The adoption of this explicit 2 percent target means that the American public need guess no longer about the Federal Reserve’s inflation intentions—either on the upside or on the downside: 2 percent is our goal.\nSecond, the framework statement discusses the challenges in providing a similar fixed goal for employment. It quite rightly emphasizes that monetary policy is not a prime determinant of maximum employment, even in the long run. The Committee’s policy stance is based on an ever-evolving assessment of the maximum level of employment in both the medium and the long term. My own assessment of the long-run unemployment rate, consistent with 2 percent inflation, is currently 5 percent—and that assessment has fallen greatly over the past 18 months.\nFinally, the framework statement describes how the Committee weighs the two mandates—promoting maximum employment and promoting price stability—against one another. Importantly, it stresses that, from the point of view of monetary policy, the two mandates are typically complementary. As I noted earlier, monetary policy pushes employment and inflation in the same direction. But, as it turns out, most shocks that push employment down also tend to push inflation down over the medium run. Hence, monetary stimulus designed to raise employment will also help the FOMC pursue its inflation objective.\nIndeed, the past few years provide a clear example of the complementarity of the FOMC’s two mandates. In terms of the employment mandate, labor market outcomes since 2007 have been distressingly weak. We can see this weak performance in a number of ways, but I’ll use two particular metrics: the unemployment rate and the employment-population ratio. The unemployment rate rose rapidly beginning in 2007, peaked at 10 percent in late 2009 and has fallen only gradually to its current level of 5.8 percent.\nLarge chart\nThe second graph depicts the fraction of people over the age of 16 who have a job. That fraction fell sharply beginning in 2007 and has since risen only slightly.\nLarge chart\nTo be clear, some of this slow recovery in employment can be attributed to a key demographic force: an increasing fraction of the people aged 16 and over reach retirement age every year. But the recovery in employment is a highly subdued one, even if we strip out this demographic effect by focusing only on those people aged 25 to 54.\nLarge chart\nSo, employment has been below its maximum level over the past seven years. What about inflation? The following graph shows that PCE inflation has averaged 1.5 percent since the beginning of the Great Recession in 2007. So, inflation has also been low relative to the FOMC’s target. And there is little sign of an uptick—over the past 12 months, inflation has been 1.4 percent.\nLarge chart\nThus, the macroeconomic shock of 2007—the Great Recession—pushed both employment and inflation below the FOMC’s goals. In this sense, the two mandates have been entirely complementary over the past seven years. Unfortunately, monetary policy has proven to be insufficiently accommodative to offset either the price or employment effects of this large shock.\nPossible Improvements in the FOMC’s Framework Statement\nThe framework statement was adopted by the FOMC in January 2012. It has been reaffirmed, with only minor wording changes, in January 2013 and again in January 2014. However, the minutes for the January 2014 meeting note that FOMC participants saw the coming year as an appropriate time to consider whether the statement could be improved in any way. I concur: The time is right to consider sharpening the FOMC’s statement of its objectives in several ways.\nI’d like to explain, and express support for, two particular clarifications related to the FOMC’s formulation of the price stability mandate.\nFirst, I believe the FOMC should be clear that its inflation objective is symmetric. Many observers emphasize the need to keep inflation from rising above 2 percent. But in my view, inflation below 2 percent is just as much of a problem as inflation above 2 percent. The central bank of Canada also has a 2 percent inflation target. Its language about symmetry is pretty clear, at least as central banking communications go: “the Bank is equally concerned about inflation rising above or falling below the target and will act … in order to bring inflation down, or to push it back up, to 2 per cent.”1 In my view, the FOMC should use similar language to characterize its inflation objective.\nWhy do I see symmetry as important? Without symmetry, inflation might spend considerably more time below 2 percent than above 2 percent. Inflation persistently below the 2 percent target could create doubts in households and businesses about whether the FOMC is truly aiming for 2 percent inflation, or some lower number. This kind of unmooring of inflation expectations would reduce the effectiveness of monetary policy as a mitigant against adverse macroeconomic shocks.\nSecond, I believe that the FOMC should consider articulating a benchmark two-year time horizon for returning inflation to the 2 percent goal. (Two years is a good choice for a benchmark because monetary policy is generally thought to affect inflation with about a two-year lag.) Right now, although the FOMC has a 2 percent inflation objective over the long run, it has not specified any time frame for achieving that objective. This lack of specificity suggests that appropriate monetary policy might engender inflation that is far from the 2 percent target for years at a time and thereby creates undue inflation (and related employment) uncertainty. Relatedly, the lack of a public timeline for a goal can sometimes lead to a lack of urgency in the pursuit of that goal. I believe that, if the FOMC publicly articulated a reasonable time benchmark for achieving the inflation goal, the Committee would be led to pursue its inflation target with even more alacrity.\nSome might argue that this kind of time horizon is impractical. In fact, many central banks incorporate a similar timing benchmark. For example, the Bank of Canada typically makes its monetary policy choices so that the inflation rate is projected to return to 2 percent within two years.2 I say “typically”—there are certainly situations in which the Bank of Canada chooses policy so that inflation is projected to return to target more slowly (sometimes taking as long as three years) or more rapidly (sometimes as quickly as 18 months). But it continues to treat two years as a benchmark, in the sense that it feels compelled to explain why it is choosing a different time horizon.\nTo sum up: I’ve suggested that the FOMC clarify that its inflation target is symmetric and that the Committee typically seeks to achieve that target within a two-year horizon. Let me emphasize that these two suggestions represent clarifications, not alterations. The framework statement, as written, is completely consistent with the formulations of price stability that I’ve proposed. However, the problem with the current statement is that it is also consistent with other interpretations of price stability (such as a 10-year horizon for returning inflation to the desired target).\n\nThe additional clarity in the framework statement would help the public understand the likely evolution of monetary policy. I’ve suggested that the FOMC should clarify that it has a symmetric inflation objective, and a two-year horizon for achieving that objective. With those goals, it would be inappropriate for the FOMC to reduce its level of accommodation if its outlook is that inflation will be below 2 percent over the following two years. After all, if the FOMC were to tighten policy in such a situation, it would be deliberately delaying the progress of inflation toward the 2 percent objective. Such an action would weaken the credibility of the FOMC’s stated two-year horizon.\nThis conclusion about appropriate monetary policy sheds light on the ongoing public conversation about whether the FOMC should begin targeting a higher range for the fed funds rate sometime in 2015. As you can see from the graph before you, inflation has been low for a long time. Inflation tends to be highly persistent, and so this long stay below target suggests that it will take some time for inflation to get back to 2 percent. Indeed, my benchmark outlook is that PCE inflation will not rise back to 2 percent until 2018. This sluggish inflation outlook implies that, at any FOMC meeting held during 2015, inflation would be expected to be below 2 percent over the following two years. It would be inappropriate for the FOMC to raise the target range for the fed funds rate at any such meeting.\nTo be clear: There is uncertainty about the evolution of the inflation outlook, and so this conclusion about the timing of lift-off is necessarily data-dependent. The language changes to the framework statement that I’ve suggested would not tell the public exactly when interest rates are going to rise. But these changes would allow the public to have a better understanding of what kind of data would engender the first interest rate increase.\nConclusions\nLet me wrap up.\nMost of the conversation about monetary policy in this country concerns what the FOMC is doing—how many assets is the Committee buying this month? How low is the Committee keeping interest rates? These are, no doubt, important questions, especially for those in the financial sector. But I’d like to encourage more discussion of the more important question for most Americans: How is the FOMC doing in terms of meeting its mandated congressional goals? I hope that my remarks today about the FOMC’s goals, and its communication about those goals, will be helpful in steering the conversation in this direction.\nThanks for listening. I look forward to taking your questions.\nNote\n* Thanks to David Fettig, Terry Fitzgerald, Rob Grunewald and Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for their assistance with these remarks.\nEndnote\n1 “Monetary Policy,” Bank of Canada, May 29, 2012.\n2 “Monetary Policy,” Bank of Canada, May 29, 2012.\n\nNote*\n\nThank you for that introduction and thank you for the invitation to join you here today.\n\nI’m planning to spend most of my time today talking about the objectives of monetary policy.

Hence, monetary policymakers in the United States are usually described as having a dual mandate: to promote price stability and maximum employment.\n\nCongress’ short overarching description of Federal Reserve objectives is the foundation for current monetary policymaking, but it does not address many specifics. In January 2012, in a key milestone in the evolution of the Fed’s communications, the FOMC adopted a longer and more precise description of its long-run goals. I’ll call this short but pathbreaking document the “framework statement.” It contains a number of important ideas—and indeed I encourage all Americans to read the entire statement—but I’ll stress three main elements.\n\nThe first element is that the framework statement explicitly translates the words “price stability” into a longer-run goal of a 2 percent annual inflation rate. Here, the term “inflation rate” refers specifically to the personal consumption expenditures (or PCE) inflation rate. This is a measure of the rate of increase in the prices of all goods and services, including those related to food and energy. The adoption of this explicit 2 percent target means that the American public need guess no longer about the Federal Reserve’s inflation intentions—either on the upside or on the downside: 2 percent is our goal.\n\nSecond, the framework statement discusses the challenges in providing a similar fixed goal for employment. It quite rightly emphasizes that monetary policy is not a prime determinant of maximum employment, even in the long run. The Committee’s policy stance is based on an ever-evolving assessment of the maximum level of employment in both the medium and the long term. My own assessment of the long-run unemployment rate, consistent with 2 percent inflation, is currently 5 percent—and that assessment has fallen greatly over the past 18 months.\n\nFinally, the framework statement describes how the Committee weighs the two mandates—promoting maximum employment and promoting price stability—against one another. Importantly, it stresses that, from the point of view of monetary policy, the two mandates are typically complementary. As I noted earlier, monetary policy pushes employment and inflation in the same direction. But, as it turns out, most shocks that push employment down also tend to push inflation down over the medium run. Hence, monetary stimulus designed to raise employment will also help the FOMC pursue its inflation objective.\n\nIndeed, the past few years provide a clear example of the complementarity of the FOMC’s two mandates. In terms of the employment mandate, labor market outcomes since 2007 have been distressingly weak. We can see this weak performance in a number of ways, but I’ll use two particular metrics: the unemployment rate and the employment-population ratio. The unemployment rate rose rapidly beginning in 2007, peaked at 10 percent in late 2009 and has fallen only gradually to its current level of 5.8 percent.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nThe second graph depicts the fraction of people over the age of 16 who have a job. That fraction fell sharply beginning in 2007 and has since risen only slightly.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nTo be clear, some of this slow recovery in employment can be attributed to a key demographic force: an increasing fraction of the people aged 16 and over reach retirement age every year. But the recovery in employment is a highly subdued one, even if we strip out this demographic effect by focusing only on those people aged 25 to 54.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nSo, employment has been below its maximum level over the past seven years. What about inflation? The following graph shows that PCE inflation has averaged 1.5 percent since the beginning of the Great Recession in 2007. So, inflation has also been low relative to the FOMC’s target. And there is little sign of an uptick—over the past 12 months, inflation has been 1.4 percent.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nThus, the macroeconomic shock of 2007—the Great Recession—pushed both employment and inflation below the FOMC’s goals. In this sense, the two mandates have been entirely complementary over the past seven years. Unfortunately, monetary policy has proven to be insufficiently accommodative to offset either the price or employment effects of this large shock.\n\nThe framework statement was adopted by the FOMC in January 2012. It has been reaffirmed, with only minor wording changes, in January 2013 and again in January 2014. However, the minutes for the January 2014 meeting note that FOMC participants saw the coming year as an appropriate time to consider whether the statement could be improved in any way. I concur: The time is right to consider sharpening the FOMC’s statement of its objectives in several ways.\n\nI’d like to explain, and express support for, two particular clarifications related to the FOMC’s formulation of the price stability mandate.\n\nFirst, I believe the FOMC should be clear that its inflation objective is symmetric. Many observers emphasize the need to keep inflation from rising above 2 percent. But in my view, inflation below 2 percent is just as much of a problem as inflation above 2 percent. The central bank of Canada also has a 2 percent inflation target. Its language about symmetry is pretty clear, at least as central banking communications go: “the Bank is equally concerned about inflation rising above or falling below the target and will act … in order to bring inflation down, or to push it back up, to 2 per cent.”1 In my view, the FOMC should use similar language to characterize its inflation objective.\n\nWhy do I see symmetry as important? Without symmetry, inflation might spend considerably more time below 2 percent than above 2 percent. Inflation persistently below the 2 percent target could create doubts in households and businesses about whether the FOMC is truly aiming for 2 percent inflation, or some lower number. This kind of unmooring of inflation expectations would reduce the effectiveness of monetary policy as a mitigant against adverse macroeconomic shocks.\n\nSecond, I believe that the FOMC should consider articulating a benchmark two-year time horizon for returning inflation to the 2 percent goal. (Two years is a good choice for a benchmark because monetary policy is generally thought to affect inflation with about a two-year lag.) Right now, although the FOMC has a 2 percent inflation objective over the long run, it has not specified any time frame for achieving that objective. This lack of specificity suggests that appropriate monetary policy might engender inflation that is far from the 2 percent target for years at a time and thereby creates undue inflation (and related employment) uncertainty. Relatedly, the lack of a public timeline for a goal can sometimes lead to a lack of urgency in the pursuit of that goal. I believe that, if the FOMC publicly articulated a reasonable time benchmark for achieving the inflation goal, the Committee would be led to pursue its inflation target with even more alacrity.\n\nSome might argue that this kind of time horizon is impractical. In fact, many central banks incorporate a similar timing benchmark. For example, the Bank of Canada typically makes its monetary policy choices so that the inflation rate is projected to return to 2 percent within two years.2 I say “typically”—there are certainly situations in which the Bank of Canada chooses policy so that inflation is projected to return to target more slowly (sometimes taking as long as three years) or more rapidly (sometimes as quickly as 18 months). But it continues to treat two years as a benchmark, in the sense that it feels compelled to explain why it is choosing a different time horizon.\n\nTo sum up: I’ve suggested that the FOMC clarify that its inflation target is symmetric and that the Committee typically seeks to achieve that target within a two-year horizon. Let me emphasize that these two suggestions represent clarifications, not alterations. The framework statement, as written, is completely consistent with the formulations of price stability that I’ve proposed. However, the problem with the current statement is that it is also consistent with other interpretations of price stability (such as a 10-year horizon for returning inflation to the desired target).\n\nThe additional clarity in the framework statement would help the public understand the likely evolution of monetary policy. I’ve suggested that the FOMC should clarify that it has a symmetric inflation objective, and a two-year horizon for achieving that objective. With those goals, it would be inappropriate for the FOMC to reduce its level of accommodation if its outlook is that inflation will be below 2 percent over the following two years. After all, if the FOMC were to tighten policy in such a situation, it would be deliberately delaying the progress of inflation toward the 2 percent objective. Such an action would weaken the credibility of the FOMC’s stated two-year horizon.\n\nThis conclusion about appropriate monetary policy sheds light on the ongoing public conversation about whether the FOMC should begin targeting a higher range for the fed funds rate sometime in 2015. As you can see from the graph before you, inflation has been low for a long time. Inflation tends to be highly persistent, and so this long stay below target suggests that it will take some time for inflation to get back to 2 percent. Indeed, my benchmark outlook is that PCE inflation will not rise back to 2 percent until 2018. This sluggish inflation outlook implies that, at any FOMC meeting held during 2015, inflation would be expected to be below 2 percent over the following two years. It would be inappropriate for the FOMC to raise the target range for the fed funds rate at any such meeting.\n\nTo be clear: There is uncertainty about the evolution of the inflation outlook, and so this conclusion about the timing of lift-off is necessarily data-dependent. The language changes to the framework statement that I’ve suggested would not tell the public exactly when interest rates are going to rise. But these changes would allow the public to have a better understanding of what kind of data would engender the first interest rate increase.\n\nLet me wrap up.\n\nMost of the conversation about monetary policy in this country concerns what the FOMC is doing—how many assets is the Committee buying this month? How low is the Committee keeping interest rates? These are, no doubt, important questions, especially for those in the financial sector. But I’d like to encourage more discussion of the more important question for most Americans: How is the FOMC doing in terms of meeting its mandated congressional goals? I hope that my remarks today about the FOMC’s goals, and its communication about those goals, will be helpful in steering the conversation in this direction.\n\nThanks for listening. I look forward to taking your questions."

This afternoon, I’ll give you some background about my job as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. I’ll then talk about two seemingly distinct topics that nonetheless emerge from two related aspects of my job. The first topic is the Bakken oil boom that is under way in western North Dakota and eastern Montana. The second topic is monetary policy—specifically, how the Federal Reserve is doing in terms of achieving its monetary policy goals. At the end of my remarks, I look forward to taking your questions. And please note that my comments today reflect my own views and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\nFederal Reserve System Basics\nLet me begin with some basics about the Federal Reserve System. I like to tell people that the Fed is a uniquely American institution. What do I mean by that? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve Banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank serves as the headquarters for Federal Reserve operations in the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts. The district includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to make monetary policy. All 12 presidents of the regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. However, the Committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a rotating group of four other presidents. I’m one of those four presidents this year. In this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government, because representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations.\nThis description of the structure of the Federal Reserve is a good motivation for the two topics that I plan to discuss today. At each FOMC meeting, Reserve Bank presidents contribute to the discussion of monetary policy by commenting on economic conditions within their own districts. Hence, Federal Reserve Bank staff economists work hard to track, understand and communicate about their district’s economy. My discussion of my first topic—the Bakken oil boom—builds on exactly that kind of work within my own Reserve Bank.\nAs I noted earlier, as a Reserve Bank president, I participate in FOMC meetings that formulate monetary policy for the country. That participation is the basis of the second topic that I plan to discuss: the Federal Reserve’s performance relative to its monetary policy goals.\nThe Bakken Oil Boom: Baseline Facts\nWith that background in mind, let me turn to my discussion of the Bakken oil boom. The term “the Bakken” refers to a shale oil formation in northwestern North Dakota and northeastern Montana.\nLarge map\nAs you can see from this map, in the United States, the Bakken oilfield covers a large swath of North Dakota and a corner of Montana. The heart of the Bakken, though, is around the city of Williston, North Dakota. Correspondingly, most of the oil production in the Bakken is taking place in North Dakota.\nNow, as it turns out, oil finds are actually not a new phenomenon in North Dakota. Oil deposits were originally discovered in North Dakota in 1951 in what is now known as the Williston Basin. Following the run-up in the price of oil in the 1970s, there was a flurry of drilling in the state during the late 1970s and early 1980s. But that boom disappeared when oil prices collapsed in the mid-1980s. By the mid-2000s, oil production in North Dakota was less than 100,000 barrels per day—that is, less than 2 percent of total U.S. oil production.1,2\nThanks to technological innovation, the situation changed greatly about 10 years ago with the combination of horizontal exploration of shale formations along with hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. This process has revolutionized oil and gas production throughout the country and around the world. In the Bakken region, this technological change means that what was once impenetrable rock is now a mother lode of oil that encompasses nearly 15,000 square miles. Thanks to the Bakken, the state of North Dakota is currently producing over 1 million barrels of oil a day—over 10 times what it produced 10 years ago and over seven times what it produced at the peak of the 1980s boom. North Dakota is now responsible for about an eighth of U.S. total crude oil production and over 1 percent of total world oil production.\nThis slide shows the rapid increase in daily oil production in North Dakota. These production levels are expected to continue for some time.\nLarge chart\nThis slide depicts the government of North Dakota’s projections for state oil production. These projections include anticipated production from what’s called the Three Forks—another large shale formation located beneath the Bakken.\nLarge chart\nImpact of the Bakken Boom: Improvements and Challenges\nBy most usual economic metrics, the oil boom has been associated with a large improvement in the North Dakota economy. If we go back to 2006, per capita real gross state product (GSP) was about 10 percent lower in North Dakota than U.S. per capita real gross domestic product (GDP). Over the next seven years, though, North Dakota per capita real GSP grew rapidly—so much so that by 2013, it was about 40 percent higher than U.S. per capita real GDP.3 The fiscal impact on the state has been even more dramatic. In the 2003-05 biennium, the state of North Dakota collected about $120 million in taxes from oil and gas production. It is projected to top $5 billion in the 2013-15 biennium—which is about $7,000 for every man, woman and child in the state! And this is just the direct tax collections. More generally, the state’s tax revenues have tripled in just six years.4\nThese are remarkable measures at the statewide level. But, at the same time, in our studies of the Bakken at the Minneapolis Fed, we have been struck by what might be called the “localness” of the Bakken’s impact.5\nThis localness phenomenon is depicted in terms of wages on this chart. It shows that wages have skyrocketed since 2004 within the Bakken counties. Wages have grown less strongly, but still robustly, in counties that are within 100 miles of the Bakken counties. Once we get outside that 100-mile circle, though, wage growth within a county is essentially unaffected by its distance from the Bakken.\nLarge chart\nAll told, though, in terms of the usual economic metrics, the Bakken boom has been a big positive for the state of North Dakota. Nonetheless, it is important to keep in mind that the boom has also created large challenges for the state. The increased production has meant an influx of people and a spike in strains on existing infrastructure. There are a myriad of ways to see those strains. I will offer just a few anecdotal examples as reported on our website:\nA growth expert we interviewed describes 1 percent to 3 percent population growth as robust. At 4 percent to 5 percent, “things are busting at the seams.” In McKenzie County, that growth rate is 8 percent per year and is expected to grow at that pace for 10 or more years. “How can they possibly keep up?” this official asks.6\nHere is a slide that shows recent population gains in Bakken counties versus the state and the nation. And remember that this is an average of all Bakken counties, so some are growing at quite high rates.\nLarge chart\nEarlier this year, Williston was reported to have the highest rental rates in the country at over $2,000 per month for entry-level, one-bedroom apartments. Rental rates in Dickinson, North Dakota, ranked fourth in the nation.7 In response to the brisk increase in population, communities in western North Dakota have been constructing apartment buildings in areas that had few. For example, in Williston, 49 permits were issued to build apartments during 2013. From 2000 to 2006, no apartment building permits were issued in Williston.8\nJust over one-quarter of the natural gas produced by Bakken oil wells is burned, or flared. This flaring releases carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, as a byproduct of combustion. Recent state regulations, though, are expected to spur increases in gas capture and reduce the proportion of wells that flare gas.9\nWater, a key component in fracking, has become an increasingly important issue as industries and communities vie for this key resource. In the city of Williston alone, water upgrades over the next six years are projected to cost $250 million. In total, new infrastructure will cost the city $625 million over that time.10\nSmaller towns are especially feeling the infrastructure squeeze. The city of Arnegard has a resident population just over 100, but it has a service population of 1,600. “They don’t have public water; their sewer system is overrun and outdated. They were less than underprepared,” said one state official.11\nThese are certainly difficult problems—but I do have confidence in the ability of North Dakotans to solve them. One source of my confidence is the 40-fold increase in tax revenues from oil and gas production that the state has experienced. Those revenues represent resources that can go a long way toward ameliorating the infrastructure strains that I’ve mentioned.\nLet me close my discussion of the Bakken boom by discussing what I see as the biggest opportunity and challenge that the boom creates—namely, the long-term development issues. Over the next 20 years, the world economy will continue to evolve technologically. Of course, we do not know exactly what course that evolution will take. But I suspect that, as has been true over the past two centuries, the evolution of technology will continue to favor the better-educated and especially those who have acquired skills associated with science, technology, engineering and mathematics. How will the residents of the Bakken and North Dakota choose to engage with this process of global technological change over the next two to three decades? The windfall of the Bakken oil boom gives them the ability to answer this question in exciting ways that would have seemed impossible a decade ago.\nMonetary Policy\nLet met turn now to my second topic, monetary policy. I will describe the goals that the FMOC seeks to achieve through its monetary policy choices. I will discuss how the Committee has done in terms of achieving those goals over the past seven years, since the onset of the Great Recession in late 2007. I’ll close by talking about my outlook for the evolution of inflation and how that outlook affects my thinking about current monetary policy choices.\nGoals of Monetary Policy\nThe natural starting point for our discussion of monetary policy goals is the Federal Reserve Act, the law in which Congress created the Fed and defined its purposes. Through the Federal Reserve Act, Congress requires the Federal Reserve to make monetary policy so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates. Most economists believe that if the Fed achieved the first two mandates (maximum employment and stable prices), it would automatically achieve the third (moderate long-term interest rates). Hence, monetary policymakers in the United States are usually described as having a dual mandate: to promote price stability and maximum employment.\nCongress’ short, overarching description of Federal Reserve objectives is the foundation for current monetary policymaking, but it does not address many specifics. In January 2012, in a key milestone in the evolution of the Fed’s communications, the FOMC adopted a longer and more precise description of its long-run goals. I’ll call the associated short but pathbreaking document the “framework statement.” It contains a number of important ideas—and indeed I encourage all Americans to read the entire statement—but I’ll stress two main elements. The first element is that the framework statement explicitly translates the words “price stability” into a longer-run goal of a 2 percent annual inflation rate. Here, the term “inflation rate” refers specifically to the personal consumption expenditures (or PCE) inflation rate. This is a measure of the rate of increase in the prices of all goods and services, including those related to food and energy. The adoption of this explicit 2 percent target means that the American public need guess no longer about the Federal Reserve’s inflation intentions, either on the upside or on the downside: 2 percent is our goal.\nSecond, the framework statement describes how the Committee weighs the two mandates—promoting maximum employment and promoting price stability—against one another. Importantly, it stresses that, from the point of view of monetary policy, the two mandates are typically complementary. As I noted earlier, monetary policy pushes employment and inflation in the same direction. But, as it turns out, most shocks that push employment down also tend to push inflation down over the medium run, and vice versa. The Bakken is a great, albeit local, example: The fracking boom has driven up both employment and prices—most notably, shelter prices—in that area. Hence, monetary stimulus designed to help the FOMC achieve its employment goals will typically help the FOMC achieve its inflation goals, and vice versa.\nMandate Performance since 2007\nI now turn to the FOMC’s performance with respect to its employment and price stability mandates over the past few years. As it turns out, this performance provides a clear example of the complementarity of the FOMC’s two mandates that I just mentioned.\nIn terms of the employment mandate, labor market outcomes, while improving, have been distressingly weak since 2007. We can see this weak performance in a number of ways, but I’ll use two particular metrics: the unemployment rate and the employment-population ratio. The unemployment rate rose rapidly beginning in 2007, peaked at 10 percent in late 2009 and has fallen only gradually to its current level of 5.8 percent.\nLarge chart\nThe second graph depicts the fraction of people over the age of 16 who have a job. That fraction fell sharply beginning in 2007 and has since risen only slightly.\nLarge chart\nTo be clear, some of this slow recovery in employment can be attributed to a key demographic force: an increasing fraction of the people aged 16 and over reach retirement age every year. But the recovery in employment is a highly subdued one, even if we strip out this demographic effect by focusing only on those people aged 25 to 54.\nLarge chart\nSo, employment has been below its maximum level over the past seven years. What about inflation? The following graph shows that PCE inflation has averaged 1.5 percent since the beginning of the Great Recession in 2007. So, inflation has also been low relative to the FOMC’s target. And there is little sign of an uptick—over the past 12 months, inflation has been 1.4 percent.\nLarge chart\nThus, the macroeconomic shock of 2007—the Great Recession—pushed both employment and inflation below the FOMC’s goals. In this sense, the two mandates have been entirely complementary over the past seven years. Unfortunately, monetary policy has proven to be insufficiently accommodative to offset either the price or employment effects of this large shock.\nMy Inflation Outlook and Its Implications for Policy\nAs you can see from the graph before you, inflation has been low for a long time. Inflation tends to be highly persistent, and so this long stay below target suggests that it will take some time for inflation to get back to 2 percent. Indeed, my benchmark outlook is that PCE inflation will not rise back to 2 percent until 2018. Similarly, the minutes from the September FOMC meeting note that Board of Governors staff currently project that inflation will remain below 2 percent over the next few years.\nThis inflation outlook has important implications for my outlook for the appropriate evolution of monetary policy. Many observers have suggested that the FOMC should begin to tighten credit conditions by raising its target range for the fed funds rate at some point in 2015. Given the lags associated with monetary policy, such a move would lower anticipated inflation over the following one to two years—that is, serve to push inflation down and further away from the FOMC’s goal of 2 percent. So, under my current outlook, it will be inappropriate for the FOMC to raise interest rates during 2015.\nLet me make a couple of comments about this conclusion. First, I’ve made no reference to the falling unemployment rate. I don’t see a falling unemployment rate as a reason to tighten policy unless that fall is generating unduly high inflationary pressures. The essence of my inflation outlook is that, despite recent and anticipated falls in the unemployment rate, I don’t see such pressures at this time.\nSecond, my conclusion is, of course, dependent on the data. My inflation outlook could rise. If so, my preferred date of interest rate “lift-off” would come forward in time—possibly into next year.\nConclusions\nLet me wrap up. I’ve discussed two disparate topics, the Bakken oil boom and appropriate monetary policy. I say these topics are disparate—but I nonetheless see them as connected. Of course, I don’t form my views about appropriate monetary policy based on conditions in the Bakken. But the Bakken is a great example of what a booming economy looks like—an economy that is actually pushing the limits of available resources, not an economy that is operating well within the limits of available resources. It is an example that I have found highly instructive as I continue to think about the degree of economic slack left at the national level.\nThank you for your attention. I look forward to taking your questions.\nNote\n*Thanks to David Fettig, Terry Fitzgerald, Rob Grunewald and Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for their assistance with these remarks.\nEndnotes\n1 World and U.S. oil production data: U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n2 North Dakota oil production data: North Dakota Industrial Commission, Department of Mineral Resources, Oil and Gas Division.\n3 Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n4 Ronald A.

This afternoon, I’ll give you some background about my job as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. I’ll then talk about two seemingly distinct topics that nonetheless emerge from two related aspects of my job.

That participation is the basis of the second topic that I plan to discuss: the Federal Reserve’s performance relative to its monetary policy goals.\n\nWith that background in mind, let me turn to my discussion of the Bakken oil boom. The term “the Bakken” refers to a shale oil formation in northwestern North Dakota and northeastern Montana.\n\n\n\nLarge map\n\nAs you can see from this map, in the United States, the Bakken oilfield covers a large swath of North Dakota and a corner of Montana.

But that boom disappeared when oil prices collapsed in the mid-1980s. By the mid-2000s, oil production in North Dakota was less than 100,000 barrels per day—that is, less than 2 percent of total U.S. oil production.1,2\n\nThanks to technological innovation, the situation changed greatly about 10 years ago with the combination of horizontal exploration of shale formations along with hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. This process has revolutionized oil and gas production throughout the country and around the world. In the Bakken region, this technological change means that what was once impenetrable rock is now a mother lode of oil that encompasses nearly 15,000 square miles. Thanks to the Bakken, the state of North Dakota is currently producing over 1 million barrels of oil a day—over 10 times what it produced 10 years ago and over seven times what it produced at the peak of the 1980s boom. North Dakota is now responsible for about an eighth of U.S. total crude oil production and over 1 percent of total world oil production.\n\nThis slide shows the rapid increase in daily oil production in North Dakota. These production levels are expected to continue for some time.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nThis slide depicts the government of North Dakota’s projections for state oil production. These projections include anticipated production from what’s called the Three Forks—another large shale formation located beneath the Bakken.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nBy most usual economic metrics, the oil boom has been associated with a large improvement in the North Dakota economy. If we go back to 2006, per capita real gross state product (GSP) was about 10 percent lower in North Dakota than U.S. per capita real gross domestic product (GDP). Over the next seven years, though, North Dakota per capita real GSP grew rapidly—so much so that by 2013, it was about 40 percent higher than U.S. per capita real GDP.3 The fiscal impact on the state has been even more dramatic. In the 2003-05 biennium, the state of North Dakota collected about $120 million in taxes from oil and gas production. It is projected to top $5 billion in the 2013-15 biennium—which is about $7,000 for every man, woman and child in the state! And this is just the direct tax collections. More generally, the state’s tax revenues have tripled in just six years.4\n\nThese are remarkable measures at the statewide level. But, at the same time, in our studies of the Bakken at the Minneapolis Fed, we have been struck by what might be called the “localness” of the Bakken’s impact.5\n\nThis localness phenomenon is depicted in terms of wages on this chart. It shows that wages have skyrocketed since 2004 within the Bakken counties. Wages have grown less strongly, but still robustly, in counties that are within 100 miles of the Bakken counties. Once we get outside that 100-mile circle, though, wage growth within a county is essentially unaffected by its distance from the Bakken.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nAll told, though, in terms of the usual economic metrics, the Bakken boom has been a big positive for the state of North Dakota. Nonetheless, it is important to keep in mind that the boom has also created large challenges for the state. The increased production has meant an influx of people and a spike in strains on existing infrastructure. There are a myriad of ways to see those strains. I will offer just a few anecdotal examples as reported on our website:\n\nThese are certainly difficult problems—but I do have confidence in the ability of North Dakotans to solve them. One source of my confidence is the 40-fold increase in tax revenues from oil and gas production that the state has experienced. Those revenues represent resources that can go a long way toward ameliorating the infrastructure strains that I’ve mentioned.\n\nLet me close my discussion of the Bakken boom by discussing what I see as the biggest opportunity and challenge that the boom creates—namely, the long-term development issues. Over the next 20 years, the world economy will continue to evolve technologically. Of course, we do not know exactly what course that evolution will take. But I suspect that, as has been true over the past two centuries, the evolution of technology will continue to favor the better-educated and especially those who have acquired skills associated with science, technology, engineering and mathematics. How will the residents of the Bakken and North Dakota choose to engage with this process of global technological change over the next two to three decades? The windfall of the Bakken oil boom gives them the ability to answer this question in exciting ways that would have seemed impossible a decade ago.\n\nLet met turn now to my second topic, monetary policy. I will describe the goals that the FMOC seeks to achieve through its monetary policy choices. I will discuss how the Committee has done in terms of achieving those goals over the past seven years, since the onset of the Great Recession in late 2007. I’ll close by talking about my outlook for the evolution of inflation and how that outlook affects my thinking about current monetary policy choices.\n\nThe natural starting point for our discussion of monetary policy goals is the Federal Reserve Act, the law in which Congress created the Fed and defined its purposes. Through the Federal Reserve Act, Congress requires the Federal Reserve to make monetary policy so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates. Most economists believe that if the Fed achieved the first two mandates (maximum employment and stable prices), it would automatically achieve the third (moderate long-term interest rates). Hence, monetary policymakers in the United States are usually described as having a dual mandate: to promote price stability and maximum employment.\n\nCongress’ short, overarching description of Federal Reserve objectives is the foundation for current monetary policymaking, but it does not address many specifics. In January 2012, in a key milestone in the evolution of the Fed’s communications, the FOMC adopted a longer and more precise description of its long-run goals. I’ll call the associated short but pathbreaking document the “framework statement.” It contains a number of important ideas—and indeed I encourage all Americans to read the entire statement—but I’ll stress two main elements. The first element is that the framework statement explicitly translates the words “price stability” into a longer-run goal of a 2 percent annual inflation rate. Here, the term “inflation rate” refers specifically to the personal consumption expenditures (or PCE) inflation rate. This is a measure of the rate of increase in the prices of all goods and services, including those related to food and energy. The adoption of this explicit 2 percent target means that the American public need guess no longer about the Federal Reserve’s inflation intentions, either on the upside or on the downside: 2 percent is our goal.\n\nSecond, the framework statement describes how the Committee weighs the two mandates—promoting maximum employment and promoting price stability—against one another. Importantly, it stresses that, from the point of view of monetary policy, the two mandates are typically complementary. As I noted earlier, monetary policy pushes employment and inflation in the same direction. But, as it turns out, most shocks that push employment down also tend to push inflation down over the medium run, and vice versa. The Bakken is a great, albeit local, example: The fracking boom has driven up both employment and prices—most notably, shelter prices—in that area. Hence, monetary stimulus designed to help the FOMC achieve its employment goals will typically help the FOMC achieve its inflation goals, and vice versa.\n\nI now turn to the FOMC’s performance with respect to its employment and price stability mandates over the past few years. As it turns out, this performance provides a clear example of the complementarity of the FOMC’s two mandates that I just mentioned.\n\nIn terms of the employment mandate, labor market outcomes, while improving, have been distressingly weak since 2007. We can see this weak performance in a number of ways, but I’ll use two particular metrics: the unemployment rate and the employment-population ratio. The unemployment rate rose rapidly beginning in 2007, peaked at 10 percent in late 2009 and has fallen only gradually to its current level of 5.8 percent.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nThe second graph depicts the fraction of people over the age of 16 who have a job. That fraction fell sharply beginning in 2007 and has since risen only slightly.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nTo be clear, some of this slow recovery in employment can be attributed to a key demographic force: an increasing fraction of the people aged 16 and over reach retirement age every year. But the recovery in employment is a highly subdued one, even if we strip out this demographic effect by focusing only on those people aged 25 to 54.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nSo, employment has been below its maximum level over the past seven years. What about inflation? The following graph shows that PCE inflation has averaged 1.5 percent since the beginning of the Great Recession in 2007. So, inflation has also been low relative to the FOMC’s target. And there is little sign of an uptick—over the past 12 months, inflation has been 1.4 percent.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nThus, the macroeconomic shock of 2007—the Great Recession—pushed both employment and inflation below the FOMC’s goals. In this sense, the two mandates have been entirely complementary over the past seven years. Unfortunately, monetary policy has proven to be insufficiently accommodative to offset either the price or employment effects of this large shock.\n\nAs you can see from the graph before you, inflation has been low for a long time. Inflation tends to be highly persistent, and so this long stay below target suggests that it will take some time for inflation to get back to 2 percent. Indeed, my benchmark outlook is that PCE inflation will not rise back to 2 percent until 2018. Similarly, the minutes from the September FOMC meeting note that Board of Governors staff currently project that inflation will remain below 2 percent over the next few years.\n\nThis inflation outlook has important implications for my outlook for the appropriate evolution of monetary policy. Many observers have suggested that the FOMC should begin to tighten credit conditions by raising its target range for the fed funds rate at some point in 2015. Given the lags associated with monetary policy, such a move would lower anticipated inflation over the following one to two years—that is, serve to push inflation down and further away from the FOMC’s goal of 2 percent. So, under my current outlook, it will be inappropriate for the FOMC to raise interest rates during 2015.\n\nLet me make a couple of comments about this conclusion. First, I’ve made no reference to the falling unemployment rate. I don’t see a falling unemployment rate as a reason to tighten policy unless that fall is generating unduly high inflationary pressures. The essence of my inflation outlook is that, despite recent and anticipated falls in the unemployment rate, I don’t see such pressures at this time.\n\nSecond, my conclusion is, of course, dependent on the data. My inflation outlook could rise. If so, my preferred date of interest rate “lift-off” would come forward in time—possibly into next year.\n\nLet me wrap up. I’ve discussed two disparate topics, the Bakken oil boom and appropriate monetary policy. I say these topics are disparate—but I nonetheless see them as connected. Of course, I don’t form my views about appropriate monetary policy based on conditions in the Bakken. But the Bakken is a great example of what a booming economy looks like—an economy that is actually pushing the limits of available resources, not an economy that is operating well within the limits of available resources. It is an example that I have found highly instructive as I continue to think about the degree of economic slack left at the national level.\n\nThank you for your attention. I look forward to taking your questions."

I would also point out that Mike is a former member of our board of directors, where he played an important role, among others, of describing economic conditions here in western Wisconsin. That kind of input is an important part of monetary policymaking. So thank you, Mike, for your service, and thanks also to anyone else in the audience who has served on our board of directors or on one of our advisory councils.\nI’m planning to spend most of my time today talking about the objectives of monetary policy. As you will hear, the FOMC has made great progress in formulating, and communicating, the objectives of monetary policy to the public. I will discuss some of that progress and then move on to some ideas about how the Committee can make further improvements along these lines. I look forward to your questions, as well—I always learn a lot from Q&A sessions.\nBefore I start, though, I must remind you that the views I express today are my own and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\nFederal Reserve System Basics\nLet me begin with some basics about the Federal Reserve System. I like to tell people that the Fed is a uniquely American institution. What do I mean by that? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve Banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts and includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to make monetary policy. All 12 presidents of the regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. However, the Committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a rotating group of four other presidents. I’m one of those four presidents this year. In this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government, because representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations.\nThis basic federalist structure has a long history. In fact, this year is the centennial of the opening of the 12 Reserve Banks and the start of the work undertaken by the Federal Reserve System. It’s been a fascinating hundred years, with many twists and turns along the way. I’m sure that many of you have questions about that journey. The answers to all of your questions—and probably more—are on a website that the Fed has created at federalreservehistory.org. I encourage you to visit this site to learn more about the people, places and events that have shaped Federal Reserve history.\nI won’t say too much more about Fed history—perhaps to the relief of some of you!—but I do want to draw your attention to one of the things that I think has changed the most over the Federal Reserve’s history: our communication with the public. A hundred years ago, Congress created a system that was designed specifically so that the residents of Main Street would have a voice in monetary policy. Technology has changed a lot since 1914, and so the ways that we gather information from Main Street have changed. But this fact-finding is still an important part of the making of monetary policy. In my travels around the Ninth District, I often meet with local business leaders and citizens to gather exactly this kind of information.\nCommunication is a two-way street, however. During the past century, the Federal Reserve’s communications to the public about its monetary policy actions have also evolved greatly. The pace of change was especially rapid in the eight years under Chairman Bernanke’s leadership. So, as the Federal Reserve System plans for its second century, I would say that the importance of two-way communication is a key lesson from the System’s first century. In order for the Fed to continue to be effective, it needs to communicate its policy decisions transparently to the public. Conversely, it also needs the public’s input on how those policies are affecting them. Events like the one today are a key part of fostering that two-way communication.\nWith that background in mind, let me turn back to the FOMC and the making of monetary policy. I mentioned that the FOMC meets eight times per year. At those meetings, we decide on the level of monetary stimulus for the economy. I won’t get into too many details of what that term “monetary stimulus” means, although I’m more than happy to take questions about it later. For now, I’ll just note that when the FOMC changes the level of stimulus, our actions tend to push inflation—that is, the rate of growth of prices—and employment in the same direction. Raising the level of stimulus puts upward pressure on both inflation and employment. Lowering the level of stimulus puts downward pressure on both inflation and employment.\nI can now turn to the main theme of the remainder of my speech: the goals that the FOMC seeks to achieve by varying the level of monetary stimulus.\nCongressional Mandates\nThe natural starting point for our discussion of monetary policy goals is the Federal Reserve Act, the law in which Congress created the Fed and defined its purposes. Through the Federal Reserve Act, Congress requires the Federal Reserve to make monetary policy so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates. Most economists believe that if the Fed achieved the first two mandates (maximum employment and stable prices), it would automatically achieve the third (moderate long-term interest rates). Hence, monetary policymakers in the United States are usually described as having a dual mandate: to promote price stability and maximum employment.\nCongress’ short overarching description of Federal Reserve objectives is the foundation for current monetary policymaking, but it does not address many specifics. In January 2012, in a key milestone in the evolution of the Fed’s communications, the FOMC adopted a longer and more precise description of its long-run goals. I’ll call this short but pathbreaking document the “framework statement.” It contains a number of important ideas—and indeed I encourage all Americans to read the entire statement—but I’ll stress three main elements.\nThe first element is that the framework statement explicitly translates the words “price stability” into a longer-run goal of a 2 percent annual inflation rate. Here, the term “inflation rate” refers specifically to the personal consumption expenditures (or PCE) inflation rate. This is a measure of the rate of increase in the prices of all goods and services, including those related to food and energy. The adoption of this explicit 2 percent target means that the American public need guess no longer about the Federal Reserve’s inflation intentions—either on the upside or on the downside: 2 percent is our goal.\nSecond, the framework statement discusses the challenges in providing a similar fixed goal for employment. It quite rightly emphasizes that monetary policy is not a prime determinant of maximum employment, even in the long run. The Committee’s policy stance is based on an ever-evolving assessment of the maximum level of employment in both the medium and the long term. My own assessment of the long-run unemployment rate, consistent with 2 percent inflation, is currently 5 percent—and that assessment has fallen greatly over the past 18 months.\nFinally, the framework statement describes how the Committee weighs the two mandates—promoting maximum employment and promoting price stability—against one another. Importantly, it stresses that, from the point of view of monetary policy, the two mandates are typically complementary. As I noted earlier, monetary policy pushes employment and inflation in the same direction. But, as it turns out, most shocks that push employment down also tend to push inflation down over the medium run. Hence, monetary stimulus designed to raise employment will also help the FOMC pursue its inflation objective.\nIndeed, the past few years provide a clear example of the complementarity of the FOMC’s two mandates. In terms of the employment mandate, labor market outcomes since 2007 have been distressingly weak. We can see this weak performance in a number of ways, but I’ll use two particular metrics: the unemployment rate and the employment-population ratio. The unemployment rate rose rapidly beginning in 2007, peaked at 10 percent in late 2009 and has fallen only gradually to its current level of 5.8 percent.\nLarge chart\nThe second graph depicts the fraction of people over the age of 16 who have a job.

In this sense, the two mandates have been entirely complementary over the past seven years. Unfortunately, monetary policy has proven to be insufficiently accommodative to offset either the price or employment effects of this large shock.\nPossible Improvements in the FOMC’s Framework Statement\nThe framework statement was adopted by the FOMC in January 2012. It has been reaffirmed, with only minor wording changes, in January 2013 and again in January 2014. However, the minutes for the January 2014 meeting note that FOMC participants saw the coming year as an appropriate time to consider whether the statement could be improved in any way. I concur: The time is right to consider sharpening the FOMC’s statement of its objectives in several ways.\nI’d like to explain, and express support for, two particular clarifications related to the FOMC’s formulation of the price stability mandate.\nFirst, I believe the FOMC should be clear that its inflation objective is symmetric. Many observers emphasize the need to keep inflation from rising above 2 percent. But in my view, inflation below 2 percent is just as much of a problem as inflation above 2 percent. The central bank of Canada also has a 2 percent inflation target. Its language about symmetry is pretty clear, at least as central banking communications go: “the Bank is equally concerned about inflation rising above or falling below the target and will act … in order to bring inflation down, or to push it back up, to 2 per cent.”1 In my view, the FOMC should use similar language to characterize its inflation objective.\nWhy do I see symmetry as important? Without symmetry, inflation might spend considerably more time below 2 percent than above 2 percent. Inflation persistently below the 2 percent target could create doubts in households and businesses about whether the FOMC is truly aiming for 2 percent inflation, or some lower number. This kind of unmooring of inflation expectations would reduce the effectiveness of monetary policy as a mitigant against adverse macroeconomic shocks.\nSecond, I believe that the FOMC should consider articulating a benchmark two-year time horizon for returning inflation to the 2 percent goal. (Two years is a good choice for a benchmark because monetary policy is generally thought to affect inflation with about a two-year lag.) Right now, although the FOMC has a 2 percent inflation objective over the long run, it has not specified any time frame for achieving that objective. This lack of specificity suggests that appropriate monetary policy might engender inflation that is far from the 2 percent target for years at a time and thereby creates undue inflation (and related employment) uncertainty. Relatedly, the lack of a public timeline for a goal can sometimes lead to a lack of urgency in the pursuit of that goal. I believe that, if the FOMC publicly articulated a reasonable time benchmark for achieving the inflation goal, the Committee would be led to pursue its inflation target with even more alacrity.\nSome might argue that this kind of time horizon is impractical. In fact, many central banks incorporate a similar timing benchmark. For example, the Bank of Canada typically makes its monetary policy choices so that the inflation rate is projected to return to 2 percent within two years.2 I say “typically”—there are certainly situations in which the Bank of Canada chooses policy so that inflation is projected to return to target more slowly (sometimes taking as long as three years) or more rapidly (sometimes as quickly as 18 months). But it continues to treat two years as a benchmark, in the sense that it feels compelled to explain why it is choosing a different time horizon.\nTo sum up: I’ve suggested that the FOMC clarify that its inflation target is symmetric and that the Committee typically seeks to achieve that target within a two-year horizon. Let me emphasize that these two suggestions represent clarifications, not alterations. The framework statement, as written, is completely consistent with the formulations of price stability that I’ve proposed. However, the problem with the current statement is that it is also consistent with other interpretations of price stability (such as a 10-year horizon for returning inflation to the desired target).\n\nThe additional clarity in the framework statement would help the public understand the likely evolution of monetary policy. I’ve suggested that the FOMC should clarify that it has a symmetric inflation objective, and a two-year horizon for achieving that objective. With those goals, it would be inappropriate for the FOMC to reduce its level of accommodation if its outlook is that inflation will be below 2 percent over the following two years. After all, if the FOMC were to tighten policy in such a situation, it would be deliberately delaying the progress of inflation toward the 2 percent objective. Such an action would weaken the credibility of the FOMC’s stated two-year horizon.\nThis conclusion about appropriate monetary policy sheds light on the ongoing public conversation about whether the FOMC should begin targeting a higher range for the fed funds rate sometime in 2015. As you can see from the graph before you, inflation has been low for a long time. Inflation tends to be highly persistent, and so this long stay below target suggests that it will take some time for inflation to get back to 2 percent. Indeed, my benchmark outlook is that PCE inflation will not rise back to 2 percent until 2018. This sluggish inflation outlook implies that, at any FOMC meeting held during 2015, inflation would be expected to be below 2 percent over the following two years. It would be inappropriate for the FOMC to raise the target range for the fed funds rate at any such meeting.\nTo be clear: There is uncertainty about the evolution of the inflation outlook, and so this conclusion about the timing of lift-off is necessarily data-dependent. The language changes to the framework statement that I’ve suggested would not tell the public exactly when interest rates are going to rise. But these changes would allow the public to have a better understanding of what kind of data would engender the first interest rate increase.\nConclusions\nLet me wrap up.\nMost of the conversation about monetary policy in this country concerns what the FOMC is doing—how many assets is the Committee buying this month? How low is the Committee keeping interest rates? These are, no doubt, important questions, especially for those in the financial sector. But I’d like to encourage more discussion of the more important question for most Americans: How is the FOMC doing in terms of meeting its mandated congressional goals? I hope that my remarks today about the FOMC’s goals, and its communication about those goals, will be helpful in steering the conversation in this direction.\nThanks for listening. I look forward to taking your questions.\nNote\n* Thanks to David Fettig, Terry Fitzgerald, Rob Grunewald and Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for their assistance with these remarks.\nEndnote\n1 “Monetary Policy,” Bank of Canada, May 29, 2012.\n2 “Monetary Policy,” Bank of Canada, May 29, 2012.\n\nNote*\n\nThank you for that introduction, Mike, and thank you for the invitation to join you here today.

Here, the term “inflation rate” refers specifically to the personal consumption expenditures (or PCE) inflation rate. This is a measure of the rate of increase in the prices of all goods and services, including those related to food and energy. The adoption of this explicit 2 percent target means that the American public need guess no longer about the Federal Reserve’s inflation intentions—either on the upside or on the downside: 2 percent is our goal.\n\nSecond, the framework statement discusses the challenges in providing a similar fixed goal for employment. It quite rightly emphasizes that monetary policy is not a prime determinant of maximum employment, even in the long run. The Committee’s policy stance is based on an ever-evolving assessment of the maximum level of employment in both the medium and the long term. My own assessment of the long-run unemployment rate, consistent with 2 percent inflation, is currently 5 percent—and that assessment has fallen greatly over the past 18 months.\n\nFinally, the framework statement describes how the Committee weighs the two mandates—promoting maximum employment and promoting price stability—against one another. Importantly, it stresses that, from the point of view of monetary policy, the two mandates are typically complementary. As I noted earlier, monetary policy pushes employment and inflation in the same direction. But, as it turns out, most shocks that push employment down also tend to push inflation down over the medium run. Hence, monetary stimulus designed to raise employment will also help the FOMC pursue its inflation objective.\n\nIndeed, the past few years provide a clear example of the complementarity of the FOMC’s two mandates. In terms of the employment mandate, labor market outcomes since 2007 have been distressingly weak. We can see this weak performance in a number of ways, but I’ll use two particular metrics: the unemployment rate and the employment-population ratio. The unemployment rate rose rapidly beginning in 2007, peaked at 10 percent in late 2009 and has fallen only gradually to its current level of 5.8 percent.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nThe second graph depicts the fraction of people over the age of 16 who have a job. That fraction fell sharply beginning in 2007 and has since risen only slightly.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nTo be clear, some of this slow recovery in employment can be attributed to a key demographic force: an increasing fraction of the people aged 16 and over reach retirement age every year. But the recovery in employment is a highly subdued one, even if we strip out this demographic effect by focusing only on those people aged 25 to 54.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nSo, employment has been below its maximum level over the past seven years. What about inflation? The following graph shows that PCE inflation has averaged 1.5 percent since the beginning of the Great Recession in 2007. So, inflation has also been low relative to the FOMC’s target. And there is little sign of an uptick—over the past 12 months, inflation has been 1.4 percent.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nThus, the macroeconomic shock of 2007—the Great Recession—pushed both employment and inflation below the FOMC’s goals. In this sense, the two mandates have been entirely complementary over the past seven years. Unfortunately, monetary policy has proven to be insufficiently accommodative to offset either the price or employment effects of this large shock.\n\nThe framework statement was adopted by the FOMC in January 2012. It has been reaffirmed, with only minor wording changes, in January 2013 and again in January 2014. However, the minutes for the January 2014 meeting note that FOMC participants saw the coming year as an appropriate time to consider whether the statement could be improved in any way. I concur: The time is right to consider sharpening the FOMC’s statement of its objectives in several ways.\n\nI’d like to explain, and express support for, two particular clarifications related to the FOMC’s formulation of the price stability mandate.\n\nFirst, I believe the FOMC should be clear that its inflation objective is symmetric. Many observers emphasize the need to keep inflation from rising above 2 percent. But in my view, inflation below 2 percent is just as much of a problem as inflation above 2 percent. The central bank of Canada also has a 2 percent inflation target. Its language about symmetry is pretty clear, at least as central banking communications go: “the Bank is equally concerned about inflation rising above or falling below the target and will act … in order to bring inflation down, or to push it back up, to 2 per cent.”1 In my view, the FOMC should use similar language to characterize its inflation objective.\n\nWhy do I see symmetry as important? Without symmetry, inflation might spend considerably more time below 2 percent than above 2 percent. Inflation persistently below the 2 percent target could create doubts in households and businesses about whether the FOMC is truly aiming for 2 percent inflation, or some lower number. This kind of unmooring of inflation expectations would reduce the effectiveness of monetary policy as a mitigant against adverse macroeconomic shocks.\n\nSecond, I believe that the FOMC should consider articulating a benchmark two-year time horizon for returning inflation to the 2 percent goal. (Two years is a good choice for a benchmark because monetary policy is generally thought to affect inflation with about a two-year lag.) Right now, although the FOMC has a 2 percent inflation objective over the long run, it has not specified any time frame for achieving that objective. This lack of specificity suggests that appropriate monetary policy might engender inflation that is far from the 2 percent target for years at a time and thereby creates undue inflation (and related employment) uncertainty. Relatedly, the lack of a public timeline for a goal can sometimes lead to a lack of urgency in the pursuit of that goal. I believe that, if the FOMC publicly articulated a reasonable time benchmark for achieving the inflation goal, the Committee would be led to pursue its inflation target with even more alacrity.\n\nSome might argue that this kind of time horizon is impractical. In fact, many central banks incorporate a similar timing benchmark. For example, the Bank of Canada typically makes its monetary policy choices so that the inflation rate is projected to return to 2 percent within two years.2 I say “typically”—there are certainly situations in which the Bank of Canada chooses policy so that inflation is projected to return to target more slowly (sometimes taking as long as three years) or more rapidly (sometimes as quickly as 18 months). But it continues to treat two years as a benchmark, in the sense that it feels compelled to explain why it is choosing a different time horizon.\n\nTo sum up: I’ve suggested that the FOMC clarify that its inflation target is symmetric and that the Committee typically seeks to achieve that target within a two-year horizon. Let me emphasize that these two suggestions represent clarifications, not alterations. The framework statement, as written, is completely consistent with the formulations of price stability that I’ve proposed. However, the problem with the current statement is that it is also consistent with other interpretations of price stability (such as a 10-year horizon for returning inflation to the desired target).\n\nThe additional clarity in the framework statement would help the public understand the likely evolution of monetary policy. I’ve suggested that the FOMC should clarify that it has a symmetric inflation objective, and a two-year horizon for achieving that objective. With those goals, it would be inappropriate for the FOMC to reduce its level of accommodation if its outlook is that inflation will be below 2 percent over the following two years. After all, if the FOMC were to tighten policy in such a situation, it would be deliberately delaying the progress of inflation toward the 2 percent objective. Such an action would weaken the credibility of the FOMC’s stated two-year horizon.\n\nThis conclusion about appropriate monetary policy sheds light on the ongoing public conversation about whether the FOMC should begin targeting a higher range for the fed funds rate sometime in 2015. As you can see from the graph before you, inflation has been low for a long time. Inflation tends to be highly persistent, and so this long stay below target suggests that it will take some time for inflation to get back to 2 percent. Indeed, my benchmark outlook is that PCE inflation will not rise back to 2 percent until 2018. This sluggish inflation outlook implies that, at any FOMC meeting held during 2015, inflation would be expected to be below 2 percent over the following two years. It would be inappropriate for the FOMC to raise the target range for the fed funds rate at any such meeting.\n\nTo be clear: There is uncertainty about the evolution of the inflation outlook, and so this conclusion about the timing of lift-off is necessarily data-dependent. The language changes to the framework statement that I’ve suggested would not tell the public exactly when interest rates are going to rise. But these changes would allow the public to have a better understanding of what kind of data would engender the first interest rate increase.\n\nLet me wrap up.\n\nMost of the conversation about monetary policy in this country concerns what the FOMC is doing—how many assets is the Committee buying this month? How low is the Committee keeping interest rates? These are, no doubt, important questions, especially for those in the financial sector. But I’d like to encourage more discussion of the more important question for most Americans: How is the FOMC doing in terms of meeting its mandated congressional goals? I hope that my remarks today about the FOMC’s goals, and its communication about those goals, will be helpful in steering the conversation in this direction.\n\nThanks for listening. I look forward to taking your questions."

            "content": "Note*\nThank you for that generous introduction, and thank you all for joining us here today. This is a special day for us at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, especially at the Helena Branch. Dave Solberg, a member of the Branch’s board of directors, will complete his service at the end of this year. I would like to extend my personal thanks to Dave for his service to the Helena Branch and, more broadly, to the Federal Reserve. The time that our directors, and members of our advisory councils, devote to their work is truly valuable. Dave and his colleagues bring important insights about the economy from people on Main Street and on farms and ranches across the region. As I have said many times, we have no end of data at the Federal Reserve, but data are backward-looking, and we need all the information we can get to make judgments about the future course of the economy. So thanks again to Dave and to his colleagues on the board, as well as anyone else in the room who has served on a Federal Reserve board or council. We appreciate your service.\nI’m planning to spend most of my time today talking about the objectives of monetary policy. As you will hear, the FOMC has made great progress in formulating, and communicating, the objectives of monetary policy to the public. I will discuss some of that progress and then move on to some ideas about how the Committee can make further improvements along these lines. I look forward to your questions, as well—I always learn a lot from Q&A sessions.\nBefore I start, though, I must remind you that the views I express today are my own and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues. \nFederal Reserve System Basics\nLet me begin with some basics about the Federal Reserve System. I like to tell people that the Fed is a uniquely American institution. What do I mean by that? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve Banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts and includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to make monetary policy. All 12 presidents of the regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. However, the Committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a rotating group of four other presidents. I’m one of those four presidents this year. In this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government, because representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations.\nThis basic federalist structure has a long history. In fact, this year is the centennial of the opening of the 12 Reserve Banks and the start of the work undertaken by the Federal Reserve System. It’s been a fascinating hundred years, with many twists and turns along the way. I’m sure that many of you have questions about that journey. The answers to all of your questions—and probably more—are on a website that the Fed has created at federalreservehistory.org. I encourage you to visit this site to learn more about the people, places and events that have shaped Federal Reserve history.\nI won’t say too much more about Fed history—perhaps to the relief of some of you!—but I do want to draw your attention to one of the things that I think has changed the most over the Federal Reserve’s history: our communication with the public. A hundred years ago, Congress created a system that was designed specifically so that the residents of Main Street would have a voice in monetary policy. Technology has changed a lot since 1914, and so the ways that we gather information from Main Street have changed. But this fact-finding is still an important part of the making of monetary policy. In my travels around the Ninth District, I often meet with local business leaders and citizens to gather exactly this kind of information.\nCommunication is a two-way street, however. During the past century, the Federal Reserve’s communications to the public about its monetary policy actions have also evolved greatly. The pace of change was especially rapid in the eight years under Chairman Bernanke’s leadership. So, as the Federal Reserve System plans for its second century, I would say that the importance of two-way communication is a key lesson from the System’s first century. In order for the Fed to continue to be effective, it needs to communicate its policy decisions transparently to the public. Conversely, it also needs the public’s input on how those policies are affecting them. Events like the one today are a key part of fostering that two-way communication.\nWith that background in mind, let me turn back to the FOMC and the making of monetary policy. I mentioned that the FOMC meets eight times per year. At those meetings, we decide on the level of monetary stimulus for the economy. I won’t get into too many details of what that term “monetary stimulus” means, although I’m more than happy to take questions about it later. For now, I’ll just note that when the FOMC changes the level of stimulus, our actions tend to push inflation—that is, the rate of growth of prices—and employment in the same direction. Raising the level of stimulus puts upward pressure on both inflation and employment. Lowering the level of stimulus puts downward pressure on both inflation and employment.\nI can now turn to the main theme of the remainder of my speech: the goals that the FOMC seeks to achieve by varying the level of monetary stimulus.\nCongressional Mandates\nThe natural starting point for our discussion of monetary policy goals is the Federal Reserve Act, the law in which Congress created the Fed and defined its purposes. Through the Federal Reserve Act, Congress requires the Federal Reserve to make monetary policy so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates. Most economists believe that if the Fed achieved the first two mandates (maximum employment and stable prices), it would automatically achieve the third (moderate long-term interest rates). Hence, monetary policymakers in the United States are usually described as having a dual mandate: to promote price stability and maximum employment.\nCongress’ short overarching description of Federal Reserve objectives is the foundation for current monetary policymaking, but it does not address many specifics. In January 2012, in a key milestone in the evolution of the Fed’s communications, the FOMC adopted a longer and more precise description of its long-run goals. I’ll call this short but pathbreaking document the “framework statement.” It contains a number of important ideas—and indeed I encourage all Americans to read the entire statement—but I’ll stress three main elements.\nThe first element is that the framework statement explicitly translates the words “price stability” into a longer-run goal of a 2 percent annual inflation rate. Here, the term “inflation rate” refers specifically to the personal consumption expenditures (or PCE) inflation rate. This is a measure of the rate of increase in the prices of all goods and services, including those related to food and energy. The adoption of this explicit 2 percent target means that the American public need guess no longer about the Federal Reserve’s inflation intentions—either on the upside or on the downside: 2 percent is our goal.\nSecond, the framework statement discusses the challenges in providing a similar fixed goal for employment. It quite rightly emphasizes that monetary policy is not a prime determinant of maximum employment, even in the long run. The Committee’s policy stance is based on an ever-evolving assessment of the maximum level of employment in both the medium and the long term. My own assessment of the long-run unemployment rate, consistent with 2 percent inflation, is currently 5 percent—and that assessment has fallen greatly over the past 18 months.\nFinally, the framework statement describes how the Committee weighs the two mandates—promoting maximum employment and promoting price stability—against one another. Importantly, it stresses that, from the point of view of monetary policy, the two mandates are typically complementary. As I noted earlier, monetary policy pushes employment and inflation in the same direction.

Hence, monetary stimulus designed to raise employment will also help the FOMC pursue its inflation objective.\nIndeed, the past few years provide a clear example of the complementarity of the FOMC’s two mandates. In terms of the employment mandate, labor market outcomes have been distressingly weak. We can see this weak performance in a number of ways, but I’ll use two particular metrics: the unemployment rate and the employment-population ratio. The unemployment rate rose rapidly beginning in 2007, peaked at 10 percent in late 2009 and has fallen only gradually to its current level of 5.9 percent.\nLarge chart\nThe second graph depicts the fraction of people over the age of 16 who have a job.

Hence, monetary policymakers in the United States are usually described as having a dual mandate: to promote price stability and maximum employment.\n\nCongress’ short overarching description of Federal Reserve objectives is the foundation for current monetary policymaking, but it does not address many specifics. In January 2012, in a key milestone in the evolution of the Fed’s communications, the FOMC adopted a longer and more precise description of its long-run goals. I’ll call this short but pathbreaking document the “framework statement.” It contains a number of important ideas—and indeed I encourage all Americans to read the entire statement—but I’ll stress three main elements.\n\nThe first element is that the framework statement explicitly translates the words “price stability” into a longer-run goal of a 2 percent annual inflation rate. Here, the term “inflation rate” refers specifically to the personal consumption expenditures (or PCE) inflation rate. This is a measure of the rate of increase in the prices of all goods and services, including those related to food and energy. The adoption of this explicit 2 percent target means that the American public need guess no longer about the Federal Reserve’s inflation intentions—either on the upside or on the downside: 2 percent is our goal.\n\nSecond, the framework statement discusses the challenges in providing a similar fixed goal for employment. It quite rightly emphasizes that monetary policy is not a prime determinant of maximum employment, even in the long run. The Committee’s policy stance is based on an ever-evolving assessment of the maximum level of employment in both the medium and the long term. My own assessment of the long-run unemployment rate, consistent with 2 percent inflation, is currently 5 percent—and that assessment has fallen greatly over the past 18 months.\n\nFinally, the framework statement describes how the Committee weighs the two mandates—promoting maximum employment and promoting price stability—against one another. Importantly, it stresses that, from the point of view of monetary policy, the two mandates are typically complementary. As I noted earlier, monetary policy pushes employment and inflation in the same direction. But, as it turns out, most shocks that push employment down also tend to push inflation down over the medium run. Hence, monetary stimulus designed to raise employment will also help the FOMC pursue its inflation objective.\n\nIndeed, the past few years provide a clear example of the complementarity of the FOMC’s two mandates. In terms of the employment mandate, labor market outcomes have been distressingly weak. We can see this weak performance in a number of ways, but I’ll use two particular metrics: the unemployment rate and the employment-population ratio. The unemployment rate rose rapidly beginning in 2007, peaked at 10 percent in late 2009 and has fallen only gradually to its current level of 5.9 percent.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nThe second graph depicts the fraction of people over the age of 16 who have a job. That fraction fell sharply beginning in 2007 and has since risen only slightly.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nTo be clear, some of this slow recovery in employment can be attributed to a key demographic force: an increasing fraction of the people aged 16 and over reach retirement age every year. But the recovery in employment is a highly subdued one, even if we strip out this demographic effect by focusing only on those people aged 25 to 54.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nSo, employment has been below its maximum level over the past seven years. What about inflation? The following graph shows that PCE inflation has averaged 1.5 percent since the beginning of the Great Recession in 2007. So, inflation has also been low relative to the FOMC’s target. And there is little sign of an uptick—over the past 12 months, inflation has been 1.5 percent.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nThus, the macroeconomic shock of 2007—the Great Recession—pushed both employment and inflation below the FOMC’s goals. In this sense, the two mandates have been entirely complementary over the past seven years. Unfortunately, monetary policy has proven to be insufficiently accommodative to offset either the price or employment effects of this large shock.\n\nThe framework statement was adopted by the FOMC in January 2012. It has been reaffirmed, with only minor wording changes, in January 2013 and again in January 2014. However, the minutes for the January 2014 meeting note that FOMC participants saw the coming year as an appropriate time to consider whether the statement could be improved in any way. I concur: The time is right to consider sharpening the FOMC’s statement of its objectives in several ways.\n\nI’d like to explain, and express support for, two particular clarifications related to the FOMC’s formulation of the price stability mandate.\n\n\n\nWhy do I see symmetry as important? Without symmetry, inflation might spend considerably more time below 2 percent than above 2 percent. Inflation persistently below the 2 percent target could create doubts in households and businesses about whether the FOMC is truly aiming for 2 percent inflation, or some lower number. This kind of unmooring of inflation expectations would reduce the effectiveness of monetary policy as a mitigant against adverse macroeconomic shocks.\n\nSecond, I believe that the FOMC should consider articulating a benchmark two-year time horizon for returning inflation to the 2 percent goal. (Two years is a good choice for a benchmark because monetary policy is generally thought to affect inflation with about a two-year lag.) Right now, although the FOMC has a 2 percent inflation objective over the long run, it has not specified any time frame for achieving that objective. This lack of specificity suggests that appropriate monetary policy might engender inflation that is far from the 2 percent target for years at a time and thereby creates undue inflation (and related employment) uncertainty. Relatedly, the lack of a public timeline for a goal can sometimes lead to a lack of urgency in the pursuit of that goal. I believe that, if the FOMC publicly articulated a reasonable time benchmark for achieving the inflation goal, the Committee would be led to pursue its inflation target with even more alacrity.\n\n\n\nTo sum up: I’ve suggested that the FOMC clarify that its inflation target is symmetric and that the Committee typically seeks to achieve that target within a two-year horizon. Let me emphasize that these two suggestions represent clarifications, not alterations. The framework statement, as written, is completely consistent with the formulations of price stability that I’ve proposed. However, the problem with the current statement is that it is also consistent with other interpretations of price stability (such as a 10-year horizon for returning inflation to the desired target).\n\nThe additional clarity in the framework statement would help the public understand the likely evolution of monetary policy. I’ve suggested that the FOMC should clarify that it has a symmetric inflation objective, and a two-year horizon for achieving that objective. With those goals, it would be inappropriate for the FOMC to reduce its level of accommodation if its outlook is that inflation will be below 2 percent over the following two years. After all, if the FOMC were to tighten policy in such a situation, it would be deliberately delaying the progress of inflation toward the 2 percent objective. Such an action would weaken the credibility of the FOMC’s stated two-year horizon.\n\nThis conclusion about appropriate monetary policy sheds light on the ongoing public conversation about whether the FOMC should begin targeting a higher range for the fed funds rate sometime in 2015. As you can see from the graph before you, inflation has been low for a long time. Inflation tends to be highly persistent, and so this long stay below target suggests that it will take some time for inflation to get back to 2 percent. Indeed, my benchmark outlook is that PCE inflation will not rise back to 2 percent until 2018. This sluggish inflation outlook implies that, at any FOMC meeting held during 2015, inflation would be expected to be below 2 percent over the following two years. It would be inappropriate for the FOMC to raise the target range for the fed funds rate at any such meeting.\n\nTo be clear: There is uncertainty about the evolution of the inflation outlook, and so this conclusion about the timing of lift-off is necessarily data-dependent. The language changes to the framework statement that I’ve suggested would not tell the public exactly when interest rates are going to rise. But these changes would allow the public to have a better understanding of what kind of data would engender the first interest rate increase.\n\nLet me wrap up.\n\nMost of the conversation about monetary policy in this country concerns what the FOMC is doing—how many assets is the Committee buying this month? How low is the Committee keeping interest rates? These are, no doubt, important questions, especially for those in the financial sector. But I’d like to encourage more discussion of the more important question for most Americans: How is the FOMC doing in terms of meeting its mandated congressional goals? I hope that my remarks today about the FOMC’s goals, and its communication about those goals, will be helpful in steering the conversation in this direction.\n\nThanks for listening. I look forward to taking your questions."

This is my second trip to Rapid City since becoming president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis five years ago, and I’m glad to be back.\nI’m planning to spend most of my time today talking about the objectives of monetary policy. As you will hear, the FOMC has made great progress in formulating, and communicating, the objectives of monetary policy to the public. I will discuss some of that progress and then move on to some ideas about how the Committee can make further improvements along these lines. I look forward to your questions, as well—I always learn a lot from Q&A sessions.\nBefore I start, though, I must remind you that the views I express today are my own and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues. \nFederal Reserve System Basics\nLet me begin with some basics about the Federal Reserve System. I like to tell people that the Fed is a uniquely American institution. What do I mean by that? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve Banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts and includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to make monetary policy. All 12 presidents of the regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. However, the Committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a rotating group of four other presidents. I’m one of those four presidents this year. In this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government, because representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations.\nThis basic federalist structure has a long history. In fact, this year is the centennial of the opening of the 12 Reserve Banks and the start of the work undertaken by the Federal Reserve System. It’s been a fascinating hundred years, with many twists and turns along the way. I’m sure that many of you have questions about that journey. The answers to all of your questions—and probably more—are on a website that the Fed has created at federalreservehistory.org. I encourage you to visit this site to learn more about the people, places and events that have shaped Federal Reserve history.\nI won’t say too much more about Fed history—perhaps to the relief of some of you!—but I do want to draw your attention to one of the things that I think has changed the most over the Federal Reserve’s history: our communication with the public. A hundred years ago, Congress created a system that was designed specifically so that the residents of Main Street would have a voice in monetary policy. Technology has changed a lot since 1914, and so the ways that we gather information from Main Street have changed. But this fact-finding is still an important part of the making of monetary policy. Indeed, earlier today, I met with members of the Minneapolis Fed’s Great Plains Advisory Council to gather exactly this kind of information.\nCommunication is a two-way street, however. During the past century, the Federal Reserve’s communications to the public about its monetary policy actions have also evolved greatly. The pace of change was especially rapid in the eight years under Chairman Bernanke’s leadership. So, as the Federal Reserve System plans for its second century, I would say that the importance of two-way communication is a key lesson from the System’s first century. In order for the Fed to continue to be effective, it needs to communicate its policy decisions transparently to the public. Conversely, it also needs the public’s input on how those policies are affecting them. Events like the one today, and my meeting with business leaders tomorrow, are a key part of fostering that two-way communication.\nWith that background in mind, let me turn back to the FOMC and the making of monetary policy. I mentioned that the FOMC meets eight times per year. At those meetings, we decide on the level of monetary stimulus for the economy. I won’t get into too many details of what that term “monetary stimulus” means, although I’m more than happy to take questions about it later. For now, I’ll just note that when the FOMC changes the level of stimulus, our actions tend to push inflation—that is, the rate of growth of prices—and employment in the same direction. Raising the level of stimulus puts upward pressure on both inflation and employment. Lowering the level of stimulus puts downward pressure on both inflation and employment.\nI can now turn to the main theme of the remainder of my speech: the goals that the FOMC seeks to achieve by varying the level of monetary stimulus.\nCongressional Mandates\nThe natural starting point for our discussion of monetary policy goals is the Federal Reserve Act, the law in which Congress created the Fed and defined its purposes. Through the Federal Reserve Act, Congress requires the Federal Reserve to make monetary policy so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates. Most economists believe that if the Fed achieved the first two mandates (maximum employment and stable prices), it would automatically achieve the third (moderate long-term interest rates).

It quite rightly emphasizes that monetary policy is not a prime determinant of maximum employment, even in the long run. The Committee’s policy stance is based on an ever-evolving assessment of the maximum level of employment in both the medium and the long term. My own assessment of the long-run unemployment rate, consistent with 2 percent inflation, is currently 5 percent—and that assessment has fallen greatly over the past 18 months.\nFinally, the framework statement describes how the Committee weighs the two mandates— promoting maximum employment and promoting price stability—against one another.

In this sense, the two mandates have been entirely complementary over the past seven years. Unfortunately, monetary policy has proven to be insufficiently accommodative to offset either the price or employment effects of this large shock.\nPossible Improvements in the FOMC’s Framework Statement\nThe framework statement was adopted by the FOMC in January 2012. It has been reaffirmed, with only minor wording changes, in January 2013 and again in January 2014. However, the minutes for the January 2014 meeting note that FOMC participants saw the coming year as an appropriate time to consider whether the statement could be improved in any way. I concur: The time is right to consider sharpening the FOMC’s statement of its objectives in several ways.\nI’d like to explain, and express support for, two particular clarifications related to the FOMC’s formulation of the price stability mandate.\nFirst, I believe the FOMC should be clear that its inflation objective is symmetric. Many observers emphasize the need to keep inflation from rising above 2 percent. But in my view, inflation below 2 percent is just as much of a problem as inflation above 2 percent. The central bank of Canada also has a 2 percent inflation target. Its language about symmetry is pretty clear, at least as central banking communications go: “the Bank is equally concerned about inflation rising above or falling below the target and will act ... in order to bring inflation down, or to push it back up, to 2 per cent.”1 In my view, the FOMC should use similar language to characterize its inflation objective.\nWhy do I see symmetry as important? Without symmetry, inflation might spend considerably more time below 2 percent than above 2 percent. Inflation persistently below the 2 percent target could create doubts in households and businesses about whether the FOMC is truly aiming for 2 percent inflation, or some lower number. This kind of unmooring of inflation expectations would reduce the effectiveness of monetary policy as a mitigant against adverse macroeconomic shocks.\nSecond, I believe that the FOMC should consider articulating a benchmark two-year time horizon for returning inflation to the 2 percent goal.

Relatedly, the lack of a public timeline for a goal can sometimes lead to a lack of urgency in the pursuit of that goal. I believe that, if the FOMC publicly articulated a reasonable time benchmark for achieving the inflation goal, the Committee would be led to pursue its inflation target with even more alacrity.\nSome might argue that this kind of time horizon is impractical. In fact, many central banks incorporate a similar timing benchmark. For example, the Bank of Canada typically makes its monetary policy choices so that the inflation rate is projected to return to 2 percent within two years.2 I say “typically”—there are certainly situations in which the Bank of Canada chooses policy so that inflation is projected to return to target more slowly (sometimes taking as long as three years) or more rapidly (sometimes as quickly as 18 months). But it continues to treat two years as a benchmark, in the sense that it feels compelled to explain why it is choosing a different time horizon.\nTo sum up: I’ve suggested that the FOMC clarify that its inflation target is symmetric and that the Committee typically seeks to achieve that target within a two-year horizon. Let me emphasize that these two suggestions represent clarifications, not alterations. The framework statement, as written, is completely consistent with the formulations of price stability that I’ve proposed. However, the problem with the current statement is that it is also consistent with other interpretations of price stability (such as a 10-year horizon for returning inflation to the desired target).\n\nThe additional clarity in the framework statement would help the public understand the likely evolution of monetary policy.

Unfortunately, monetary policy has proven to be insufficiently accommodative to offset either the price or employment effects of this large shock.\n\nThe framework statement was adopted by the FOMC in January 2012. It has been reaffirmed, with only minor wording changes, in January 2013 and again in January 2014. However, the minutes for the January 2014 meeting note that FOMC participants saw the coming year as an appropriate time to consider whether the statement could be improved in any way. I concur: The time is right to consider sharpening the FOMC’s statement of its objectives in several ways.\n\nI’d like to explain, and express support for, two particular clarifications related to the FOMC’s formulation of the price stability mandate.\n\nFirst, I believe the FOMC should be clear that its inflation objective is symmetric. Many observers emphasize the need to keep inflation from rising above 2 percent. But in my view, inflation below 2 percent is just as much of a problem as inflation above 2 percent. The central bank of Canada also has a 2 percent inflation target. Its language about symmetry is pretty clear, at least as central banking communications go: “the Bank is equally concerned about inflation rising above or falling below the target and will act ... in order to bring inflation down, or to push it back up, to 2 per cent.”1 In my view, the FOMC should use similar language to characterize its inflation objective.\n\nWhy do I see symmetry as important? Without symmetry, inflation might spend considerably more time below 2 percent than above 2 percent. Inflation persistently below the 2 percent target could create doubts in households and businesses about whether the FOMC is truly aiming for 2 percent inflation, or some lower number. This kind of unmooring of inflation expectations would reduce the effectiveness of monetary policy as a mitigant against adverse macroeconomic shocks.\n\nSecond, I believe that the FOMC should consider articulating a benchmark two-year time horizon for returning inflation to the 2 percent goal. (Two years is a good choice for a benchmark because monetary policy is generally thought to affect inflation with about a two-year lag.) Right now, although the FOMC has a 2 percent inflation objective over the long run, it has not specified any time frame for achieving that objective. This lack of specificity suggests that appropriate monetary policy might engender inflation that is far from the 2 percent target for years at a time and thereby creates undue inflation (and related employment) uncertainty. Relatedly, the lack of a public timeline for a goal can sometimes lead to a lack of urgency in the pursuit of that goal. I believe that, if the FOMC publicly articulated a reasonable time benchmark for achieving the inflation goal, the Committee would be led to pursue its inflation target with even more alacrity.\n\nSome might argue that this kind of time horizon is impractical. In fact, many central banks incorporate a similar timing benchmark. For example, the Bank of Canada typically makes its monetary policy choices so that the inflation rate is projected to return to 2 percent within two years.2 I say “typically”—there are certainly situations in which the Bank of Canada chooses policy so that inflation is projected to return to target more slowly (sometimes taking as long as three years) or more rapidly (sometimes as quickly as 18 months). But it continues to treat two years as a benchmark, in the sense that it feels compelled to explain why it is choosing a different time horizon.\n\nTo sum up: I’ve suggested that the FOMC clarify that its inflation target is symmetric and that the Committee typically seeks to achieve that target within a two-year horizon. Let me emphasize that these two suggestions represent clarifications, not alterations. The framework statement, as written, is completely consistent with the formulations of price stability that I’ve proposed. However, the problem with the current statement is that it is also consistent with other interpretations of price stability (such as a 10-year horizon for returning inflation to the desired target).\n\nThe additional clarity in the framework statement would help the public understand the likely evolution of monetary policy. I’ve suggested that the FOMC should clarify that it has a symmetric inflation objective, and a two-year horizon for achieving that objective. With those goals, it would be inappropriate for the FOMC to reduce its level of accommodation if its outlook is that inflation will be below 2 percent over the following two years. After all, if the FOMC were to tighten policy in such a situation, it would be deliberately delaying the progress of inflation toward the 2 percent objective. Such an action would weaken the credibility of the FOMC’s stated two-year horizon.\n\nThis conclusion about appropriate monetary policy sheds light on the ongoing public conversation about whether the FOMC should begin targeting a higher range for the fed funds rate sometime in 2015. As you can see from the graph before you, inflation has been low for a long time. Inflation tends to be highly persistent, and so this long stay below target suggests that it will take some time for inflation to get back to 2 percent. Indeed, my benchmark outlook is that PCE inflation will not rise back to 2 percent until 2018. This sluggish inflation outlook implies that, at any FOMC meeting held during 2015, inflation would be expected to be below 2 percent over the following two years. It would be inappropriate for the FOMC to raise the target range for the fed funds rate at any such meeting.\n\nTo be clear: There is uncertainty about the evolution of the inflation outlook, and so this conclusion about the timing of lift-off is necessarily data-dependent. The language changes to the framework statement that I’ve suggested would not tell the public exactly when interest rates are going to rise. But these changes would allow the public to have a better understanding of what kind of data would engender the first interest rate increase.\n\nLet me wrap up.\n\nMost of the conversation about monetary policy in this country concerns what the FOMC is doing—how many assets is the Committee buying this month? How low is the Committee keeping interest rates? These are, no doubt, important questions, especially for those in the financial sector. But I’d like to encourage more discussion of the more important question for most Americans: How is the FOMC doing in terms of meeting its mandated congressional goals? I hope that my remarks today about the FOMC’s goals, and its communication about those goals, will be helpful in steering the conversation in this direction.\n\nThanks for listening. I look forward to taking your questions."

            "content": "Note*\nIntroduction\nThank you for that generous introduction, and thank you for the invitation to join you here today. This is my second trip to Marquette since becoming president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis five years ago, and I’m glad to be back.\nI’m planning to spend most of my time today talking about the objectives of monetary policy. As you will hear, the FOMC has made great progress in formulating, and communicating, the objectives of monetary policy to the public. I will discuss some of that progress and then move on to some ideas about how the Committee can make further improvements along these lines. I look forward to your questions, as well—I always learn a lot from Q&A sessions.\nBefore I start, though, I must remind you that the views I express today are my own and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues. \nFederal Reserve System Basics\nLet me begin with some basics about the Federal Reserve System. I like to tell people that the Fed is a uniquely American institution. What do I mean by that? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve Banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts and includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to make monetary policy. All 12 presidents of the regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. However, the Committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a rotating group of four other presidents. I’m one of those four presidents this year. In this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government, because representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations.\nThis basic federalist structure has a long history. In fact, this year is the centennial of the opening of the 12 Reserve Banks and the start of the work undertaken by the Federal Reserve System. It’s been a fascinating hundred years, with many twists and turns along the way. I’m sure that many of you have questions about that journey. The answers to all of your questions—and probably more—are on a website that the Fed has created at federalreservehistory.org. I encourage you to visit this site to learn more about the people, places and events that have shaped Federal Reserve history.\nI won’t say too much more about Fed history—perhaps to the relief of some of you!—but I do want to draw your attention to one of the things that I think has changed the most over the Federal Reserve’s history: our communication with the public. A hundred years ago, Congress created a system that was designed specifically so that the residents of Main Street would have a voice in monetary policy. Technology has changed a lot since 1914—I’m told that they didn’t even have smartphones back then—and so the ways that we gather information from Main Street have changed. But this fact-finding is still an important part of the making of monetary policy. Indeed, tomorrow, I will meet with Upper Peninsula business leaders to gather exactly this kind of information.\nCommunication is a two-way street, however. During the past century, the Federal Reserve’s communications to the public about its monetary policy actions have also evolved greatly. The pace of change was especially rapid in the eight years under Chairman Bernanke’s leadership. So, as the Federal Reserve System plans for its second century, I would say that the importance of two-way communication is a key lesson from the System’s first century. In order for the Fed to continue to be effective, it needs to communicate its policy decisions transparently to the public. Conversely, it also needs the public’s input on how those policies are affecting them. Events like the one today, and my meeting with business leaders tomorrow, are a key part of fostering that two-way communication.\nWith that background in mind, let me turn back to the FOMC and the making of monetary policy. I mentioned that the FOMC meets eight times per year. At those meetings, we decide on the level of monetary stimulus for the economy. I won’t get into too many details of what that term “monetary stimulus” means, although I’m more than happy to take questions about it later. For now, I’ll just note that when the FOMC changes the level of stimulus, our actions tend to push inflation—that is, the rate of growth of prices—and employment in the same direction. Raising the level of stimulus puts upward pressure on both inflation and employment. Lowering the level of stimulus puts downward pressure on both inflation and employment.\nI can now turn to the main theme of the remainder of my speech: the goals that the FOMC seeks to achieve by varying the level of monetary stimulus.\nCongressional Mandates\nThe natural starting point for our discussion of monetary policy goals is the Federal Reserve Act, the law in which Congress created the Fed and defined its purposes. Through the Federal Reserve Act, Congress requires the Federal Reserve to make monetary policy so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates. Most economists believe that if the Fed achieved the first two mandates (maximum employment and stable prices), it would automatically achieve the third (moderate long-term interest rates). Hence, monetary policymakers in the United States are usually described as having a dual mandate: to promote price stability and maximum employment.\nCongress’ short, overarching description of Federal Reserve objectives is the foundation for current monetary policymaking, but it does not address many specifics. In January 2012, in a key milestone in the evolution of the Fed’s communications, the FOMC adopted a longer and more precise description of its long-run goals. I’ll call this short but pathbreaking document the “framework statement.” It contains a number of important ideas—and indeed I encourage all Americans to read the entire statement—but I’ll stress three main elements.\nThe first element is that the framework statement explicitly translates the words “price stability” into a longer-run goal of a 2 percent annual inflation rate. Here, the term “inflation rate” refers specifically to the personal consumption expenditures (or PCE) inflation rate. This is a measure of the rate of increase in the prices of all goods and services, including those related to food and energy. The adoption of this explicit 2 percent target means that the American public need guess no longer about the Federal Reserve’s inflation intentions—either on the upside or on the downside: 2 percent is our goal.\nSecond, the framework statement discusses the challenges in providing a similar fixed goal for employment. It quite rightly emphasizes that monetary policy is not a prime determinant of maximum employment, even in the long run. The Committee’s policy stance is based on an ever-evolving assessment of the maximum level of employment in both the medium and the long term. My own assessment of the long-run unemployment rate, consistent with 2 percent inflation, is currently 5 percent—and that assessment has fallen greatly over the past 18 months.\nFinally, the framework statement describes how the Committee weighs the two mandates— promoting maximum employment and promoting price stability—against one another. Importantly, it stresses that, from the point of view of monetary policy, the two mandates are typically complementary. As I noted earlier, monetary policy pushes employment and inflation in the same direction. But, as it turns out, most shocks that push employment down also tend to push inflation down over the medium run. Hence, monetary stimulus designed to raise employment will also help the FOMC pursue its inflation objective. I think that this point is often underemphasized in popular discussions of monetary policy.\nThe statement notes that there may be cases in which the mandates are not complementary—meaning that inflation is expected to be above target when the unemployment rate is expected to be unduly high. The framework statement explains that, in these circumstances, the FOMC will use a balanced approach to the two mandates when formulating monetary policy. In earlier speeches, I’ve discussed this language in some detail. In my view, this language implies that the FOMC is willing to allow inflation to run above 2 percent for some time to facilitate a faster decline in the unemployment rate.\nPossible Improvements in the FOMC’s Framework Statement\nThe framework statement was adopted by the FOMC in January 2012. It has been reaffirmed, with only minor wording changes, in January 2013 and again in January 2014. However, the minutes for the January 2014 meeting note that FOMC participants saw the coming year as an appropriate time to consider whether the statement could be improved in any way. I concur: The time is right to consider sharpening the FOMC’s statement of its objectives in several ways.\nThe minutes note two possible changes along these lines. I’d like to explain, and express support for, both of these.\nVideo excerpt: The FOMC’s inflation objective should be symmetric (78 seconds)\nFirst, I believe the FOMC should be clear that its inflation objective is symmetric. Many observers emphasize the need to keep inflation from rising above 2 percent. But in my view, inflation below 2 percent is just as much of a problem as inflation above 2 percent. The central bank of Canada also has a 2 percent inflation target. Its language about symmetry is pretty clear, at least as central banking communications go: “the Bank is equally concerned about inflation rising above or falling below the target and will act ... in order to bring inflation down, or to push it back up, to 2 percent.”1 In my view, the FOMC should use similar language to characterize its inflation objective.\nVideo excerpt: Why symmetry is important (35 seconds)\nWhy do I see symmetry as important? Without symmetry, inflation might spend considerably more time below 2 percent than above 2 percent. Inflation persistently below the 2 percent target could create doubts in households and businesses about whether the FOMC is truly aiming for 2 percent inflation, or some lower number. This kind of unmooring of inflation expectations would reduce the effectiveness of monetary policy as a mitigant against adverse macroeconomic shocks.\nAnother way to improve the FOMC’s framework statement would be to describe more clearly how the mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability are linked with financial stability considerations. Many observers, including FOMC participants, have noted that the stance of monetary policy could affect the buildup of risks and risk sensitivities in the financial system. For example, it is sometimes argued that the current low interest rate policies designed to stimulate economic activity will also encourage households and corporations to accumulate large amounts of debt. We saw in 2007 that this kind of leverage, if undertaken in sufficient magnitudes, has the potential to create risks to employment and inflation.\nTwo Other Possible Improvements\nThe two issues I’ve just mentioned—symmetry of the inflation objective and the role of financial stability—have been noted as under discussion in previous FOMC minutes. In my view, there are two other possible improvements to the FOMC’s statement of its long-run goals that have not yet been mentioned in the minutes but deserve further Committee study.\nVideo excerpt: The need for a clear time horizon (58 seconds)\nFirst, I believe that the FOMC should consider articulating a benchmark two-year time horizon for returning inflation to the 2 percent goal. (Two years is a good choice for a benchmark because monetary policy is generally thought to affect inflation with about a two-year lag.) Right now, although the FOMC has a 2 percent inflation objective over the long run, it has not specified any time frame for achieving that objective. This lack of specificity suggests that appropriate monetary policy might engender inflation that is far from the 2 percent target for years at a time and thereby creates undue inflation (and related employment) uncertainty.

I believe that, if the FOMC publicly articulated a reasonable time benchmark for achieving the inflation goal, the Committee would be led to pursue its inflation target with even more alacrity.\nSome might argue that this kind of time horizon is impractical. In fact, many central banks incorporate a similar timing benchmark.

I say “typically”—there are certainly situations in which the Bank of Canada chooses policy so that inflation is projected to return to target more slowly (sometimes taking as long as three years) or more rapidly (sometimes as quickly as 18 months). But it continues to treat two years as a benchmark, in the sense that it feels compelled to explain why it is choosing a different time horizon.\nThe second possible change in the framework statement that deserves further study is to consider targeting the price level, as opposed to the inflation rate. I’ve discussed the benefits of price level targeting, relative to inflation targeting, at some length in prior speeches. The relevant issues are somewhat technical, and so I don’t plan to talk about them today. However, I’m certainly happy to talk about the two kinds of targeting during the Q&A period if anyone is interested.\nConclusions\nThe Federal Reserve has existed for over a hundred years. No organization lasts for so long without an ability to evolve in response to changes in conditions. The Federal Reserve is no exception. The changes in our public communications about monetary policy are especially notable.\nThe release of our framework statement for monetary policymaking in January 2012 was a key milestone in the evolution of our communications. But I am glad that, as we indicated in January 2014, we are willing to consider amending the statement in possibly substantial ways. We are always learning how to communicate about policy in better ways.\nThanks for listening. I look forward to taking your questions.\nNote\n* Thanks to David Fettig, Terry Fitzgerald and Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for their assistance with these remarks.\nEndnote\n1 “Monetary Policy,” Bank of Canada, May 29, 2012.\n\nNote*\n\nThank you for that generous introduction, and thank you for the invitation to join you here today.

            "content": "Thanks for the introduction, Tom. It’s a pleasure to be back in Helena—the site of the only branch office of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.\nI’ll kick things off with some basics about the Federal Reserve System and some thoughts about Fed history. But the plan is for us to spend the bulk of our evening on your questions. One key point before I proceed: The views I express today are my own and are not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System, including my colleagues on the FOMC.\nIn terms of basics about the Fed: I like to tell people that the Fed is a uniquely American institution. What do I mean by that? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve Banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts and includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to set monetary policy over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. However, the Committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a rotating group of four other presidents. I’m one of those four presidents this year. In this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government, because representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations.\nThis basic federalist structure has a long history. In fact, this year is the centennial of the opening of the 12 Reserve Banks and the start of the work undertaken by the Federal Reserve System. It’s been a fascinating hundred years, with many twists and turns along the way. I’m sure that many of you have questions about that journey. The answers to all of your questions—and probably more—are on a website that the Fed has created at federalreservehistory.org. I encourage you to visit this site to learn more about the people, places and events that have shaped Federal Reserve history. I’d especially encourage you to look up Norman Holter. Mr. Holter was one of the original directors of the Minneapolis Reserve Bank, and he played the key role in a branch office being established here in Helena in 1921.\nI’ve always enjoyed reading and studying history. And I strongly believe that history can help inform policymakers’ decisions in the current day. But, at the same time, I do think that policymakers need to be careful in how they use history. The monetary history of the 1970s is a great example of this need for care. I’m sure that some of you in this room remember that inflation—the rate of growth of prices—rose to disturbingly high levels in the 1970s. Faced with this challenge, President Ford launched a national campaign to “Whip Inflation Now”—WIN for short. The famous Broadway composer Meredith Willson wrote a song for the WIN campaign in which he summarized the economic situation in these catchy lyrics: “Who needs inflation? Not this nation! Who’s going to pass it by? You are and so am I!”\nMr. Willson’s pithy characterization was spot on in 1974. But 40 years later, I would suggest that it’s exactly backward. Right now, this nation needs more inflation. The Federal Reserve aims to keep the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation rate at 2 percent. But since the start of the recession almost seven years ago, the PCE inflation rate has averaged 1.5 percent. Over the past year, it has averaged 1.6 percent. And I expect it to remain below 2 percent until 2018.\nThe persistently below-target inflation rate is a signal that the U.S. economy is not taking advantage of all of its available resources. If demand were sufficiently high to generate 2 percent, then demand would be sufficiently high to allow the economy to make use of the underutilized resources. And the most important of those resources is the American people. There are many people in this country who want to work more hours, and our society is deprived of their production.\nSo, it’s fun and educational to read about the 1970s on the Fed history gateway. I encourage you to do so. But it’s critical for monetary policymakers like myself to realize that the times, and challenges, that we face are different from the ones that Mr. Willson wrote about back in 1974.\nThanks again for coming tonight. And now let’s turn to your questions.\n\nThanks for the introduction, Tom.

            "content": "Note*\nI want to thank Marshall and other ICBM officers and members for inviting me to your annual conference. I appreciate the opportunity to share my views on community banking with all of you, but just as importantly, I look forward to your questions and our discussion following my talk. Today I will talk mainly about the state of community banking, especially here in Minnesota, and I will conclude with some thoughts on the country’s economic performance. Before I begin, just a reminder that the following views are my own and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\nThis pairing of community banking and economic performance is natural and important. What happens in Main Street credit markets has a significant influence on the broader economy. Community banks are an essential credit provider for Main Street. Community banks have the skills and knowledge to evaluate borrowers who, because of their size, activity or location, are relatively costly for an outside firm to evaluate. As a result, community banks facilitate beneficial economic activity that would not otherwise take place. The individuals and businesses receiving credit from your banks are key components in both local and national economies; they produce valuable output and provide numerous jobs. As I will describe later, these are central concerns of the Federal Reserve as we seek to promote maximum employment and price stability.\nI will make my four main points on the state of community banking.\nCommunity bank recovery from the financial crisis has been strong with regard to asset quality, but earnings and loan growth have lagged.\nLagging earnings and loans have raised questions about the cost of new, post-crisis supervision and regulation.\nLow earnings and higher regulatory costs have also raised concerns about community bank consolidation and its potential acceleration.\nIn response to these concerns and as a matter of prudent public policy, I strongly support “tailoring” supervision and regulation to reflect the risks and roles of community banks.\nI will now describe these issues in more detail.\nCommunity bank conditions\nCommunity banks in Minnesota and the nation experienced a very sharp increase in problem loans during the financial crisis. Fortunately, that trend has now reversed.\n\nConsider a standard measure of problem loans: the ratio of noncurrent and delinquent loans to bank capital and the allowance for loan loss. In the first quarter of 2009, that ratio rose for all loans to 24 percent for the median Minnesota bank, double the 25-year median level of 12 percent. For commercial real estate loans, the problem loan ratio rose to about 9 percent, nine times higher than the 20-year median of 1 percent.\nThe problem loan story has changed completely. The ratio for total loans is at 9.5 percent for the median Minnesota bank, right around the 25-year low. And the ratio for problem commercial real estate loans for the median Minnesota bank is at 2 percent and rapidly returning to pre-crisis levels. These same general patterns hold for the nation’s banks.\nThe low earnings and negative loan growth for the median Minnesota bank have also improved, but not yet to pre-crisis levels. Return on average assets, a standard measure of profitability, has been holding very steady for the past several years at just below 1 percent. This is clearly better than the trough of 0.5 percent during the crisis. But the 20-year median is 1.15 percent. Currently, the return on average assets of the median Minnesota bank is at 0.94 percent, which is at the 19th percentile for the past 20 years.\nYear-over-year net loan growth for the Minnesota median bank is at 4.6 percent. Again, this is much better than the -4.7 percent crisis trough; indeed, negative growth persisted through the end of 2012. But the 25-year median is nearly 6 percent for Minnesota banks, while 4.6 percent is at the 39th percentile. The nation’s banks show similar general patterns.\nSo, yes, there has been recovery in important ways for community banks in the state. But other important measures continue to lag historical norms more than five years after crisis depths. This weaker-than-hoped-for performance is one factor raising concerns for community banks about the additional supervision and regulation burden that faces them post-crisis. I’d like to turn to those concerns now.\nPost-financial crisis supervision and regulation of community banks\nLow earnings levels have many potential sources. Let me mention three. First, on the revenue side, weak loan growth naturally leads to more competition for available loans and drives down returns. Second, if banks can’t make more loans, they typically replace loans going off their books with securities. But securities usually earn less than loans, lowering bank returns. Finally, interest rates are at very low levels, and that compresses bank margins.\nHigher costs can also reduce bank earnings, and it is clear that the costs of complying with bank regulation and supervision are increasing. Since the financial crisis, and the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, supervision of community banks and the entire banking sector has become more intense. This is not a transitory change reflecting weak asset quality. Instead, supervisors have recalibrated risk management expectations broadly for community banks. I see higher expectations continuing to spread across bank operations. Meeting these expectations will increase bank costs.\nTo what extent has additional supervision and regulation raised costs, reduced earnings and shrunk profits? This is difficult to answer with precision, but analysis at the Minneapolis Fed indicates that reductions to profitability could be material, particularly for the smallest community banks. Our estimates suggest, for example, that the median reduction in return on assets for banks with less than $50 million in assets would be 14 basis points if they need to increase staff by half a person, and 45 basis points if by two employees.1\nReduced returns on assets can encourage capital to flow from the banking industry. And, indeed, bankers routinely raise concerns with me about the potential for more regulation to drive consolidation in the industry, a topic to which I now turn.\nCommunity bank consolidation\nThe number of community banks in Minnesota has been falling for some time. There were 341 banks chartered in Minnesota as of the first quarter of 2014, down from a peak of 760 in 1980. As noted, many are concerned that the rate of decline will rise as increased supervision and regulation depresses earnings. Many bankers also tell me about intangible costs, arguing that some new compliance requirements distract from serving customers. These soft costs could also drive bankers to exit the industry.\nMy concern is with the public policy aspect of this matter. It is possible that the evolution of information technology may have increased the returns to scale in banking. As a society, we should expect and indeed welcome consolidation as a response to this natural economic force. But there is a policy concern if negative benefit/cost regulation or supervision drives out banks that would otherwise effectively serve customers.\nTo help determine if new regulations and supervision introduced since the financial crisis have led to more rapid consolidation, the Minneapolis Fed is estimating future consolidation of banks in the United States and Ninth District states based on historical trends. If consolidation exceeds projected rates, that might suggest that new supervision and regulation has changed the dynamics of banking. So far, however, the rate of recent consolidation of Minnesota community banks has been consistent with historical patterns. We continue to monitor consolidation rates relative to forecasts in order to be able to detect changes that are not readily attributable to technological forces. Our website contains quarterly updates of these forecasts.\nBut both bankers and policymakers are concerned about the long-term health of community banking, not just next year’s numbers. How many community banks will exist in 10 years? Of course, I cannot answer this question with certainty, but I can offer a few perspectives. If historical patterns continue, the number will fall considerably. There will be just 263 banks in Minnesota in 2024, a 23 percent decline from 341 currently, assuming that consolidation over the next 10 years continues the trend seen over the past 30. Or we could assume a slower rate of consolidation, like the 14 percent decline from 1995 to 2005. That would put the number at 293 community banks 10 years from now.\nThis is an admittedly crude modeling approach. We have also constructed a more elaborate statistical model of the potential long-run decline in the number of banks in Minnesota. Our statistical model is based on the historical movement of banks into, and out of, different asset groupings. Some banks get larger and move from one size bucket to another, while other banks exit the industry altogether. This transitional model—which we use to forecast the number of banks in Minnesota one year out on our website—suggests that the number of banks in the state will fall to 282 in 10 years.\nI’ve discussed three different estimates. They all predict that the number of banks in Minnesota will fall sharply over the next 10 years—from the current 341 to a number in the high 200s. By way of comparison, the median decline in the number of banks for all states across all 10-year periods since 1985 is 25 percent, a bit higher than some of the estimates we provided.\nTo be clear, these forecasts are only estimates. They should be interpreted accordingly. The actual number of banks may turn out to be smaller—or, indeed, it might turn out be larger.\nTailoring community bank supervision\nI’ve already noted that it is a matter of considerable public policy concern if regulations, not market forces, are important causes of bank consolidation. Federal Reserve policymakers have recently discussed how better tailoring of supervision and regulation to community banks can be helpful in reducing the extent of this problem.2 The Federal Reserve does some tailoring already, but I think we should do more. I’ll mention two examples of the kind of tailoring that I have in mind. I’ll then turn to two additional steps we might consider.\nOn safety and soundness, the Federal Reserve and other agencies received excellent comments from community banks on the Basel III proposal. These comments led to changes to the proposed rule that reduce unnecessary burdens on smaller banks.3 Smaller banks can opt out from having their capital levels vary due to changes in particularly volatile aspects of income. The final rule also allows smaller institutions to continue to count certain types of stock or securities as capital, when larger banks cannot. I think the rule-making process worked well in this instance. Issuing a preliminary rule and receiving comments from bankers allowed the final regulation to better address the actual risks posed by community banks.\nOn the consumer side, the Federal Reserve has moved to a more risk-focused exam process, from the less flexible previous approach. The new framework allows our examiners to better tailor their exams to the consumer risks that a particular bank may actually pose. Many banks that the Minneapolis Fed supervises do not engage in activities that pose a high risk to consumer protection. And many also have a strong, documented record of compliance and relatively little change in operations. Under the new framework, examiners can more readily eliminate certain areas of review.\nThe benefits of the new consumer program go beyond a more focused scope. The new framework encourages more of our supervisory work to occur off-site, thereby reducing the on-site burden we put on community banks. At the same time, where there are potentially risky activities, the new framework allows for a deeper dive.\nIn sum, I think the new consumer exam framework epitomizes the tailoring we need. It’s based on an analytical approach aimed at improving supervision, and it also captures institution-specific details where appropriate.\nWhere can we engage in additional tailoring? Governor Daniel Tarullo has noted potential benefits in reviewing statutes that apply new regulations to all banks. Community banks may not create the risks that a specific regulation addresses. In that vein, he noted the so-called Volcker rule and Dodd-Frank incentive compensation requirements. I strongly agree with Governor Tarullo’s point that Congress and supervisors should exempt all community banks from certain regulations. Exempting is the best way to guard against regulatory trickle-down.\nA second fruitful approach to additional tailoring concerns supervision, not regulation. I worry that our current supervisory methods establish expectations that are too detailed across too many areas of bank operations and too wide a swath of banks. Alternatively, supervisors could concentrate on a smaller number of activities that we believe are correlated with bad outcomes. To be specific, supervisors could choose to focus on rapid loan growth, high lending concentrations, specific high-risk types of lending and wholesale funding strategies and skip some of the more detailed reviews. This shift in focus might generate higher returns to society, in terms of improved safety and soundness per dollar spent, than detailed work programs. To be clear: I’m suggesting a tailored approach, and so supervisors could retain the more comprehensive, proscriptive approach for larger, systemically important banks.\nI offer these ideas not as final prescriptions, but in the spirit of open inquiry. My main point is that we need to further investigate ways to tailor the supervision and regulation of community banks. For the remainder of my remarks, I will turn my attention to the country’s economic performance.\nBrief economic review\nHowever, don’t worry—I won’t have as much to say about the state of the economy as I did about community banking. I’m a member of the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—and, as a monetary policymaker, my discussion will be framed by the goals of monetary policy. Congress has charged the FOMC with making monetary policy so as to promote price stability and maximum employment. I’ll discuss the state of the macroeconomy in terms of these goals.\nLet me start with price stability. The FOMC has translated the price stability objective into an inflation rate goal of 2 percent per year. This inflation rate target refers to the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, price index. This is a measure of inflation that is based on the rate of increase in the prices of all goods and services, including those related to food and energy. That rate currently stands at 1.6 percent, which is below the FOMC’s target of 2 percent. In fact, the inflation rate has averaged 1.6 percent since the start of the recession six and a half years ago, and inflation is expected to remain low for some time. For example, the minutes from the June FOMC meeting reveal that the Federal Reserve Board staff outlook is for inflation to remain below 2 percent over the next few years.\nIn a similar vein, earlier this year, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) predicted that inflation will not reach 2 percent until 2018—more than 10 years after the beginning of the Great Recession. I agree with this forecast. This means that the FOMC is still a long way from meeting its targeted goal of price stability.\nThe second FOMC goal is to promote maximum employment. What, then, is the state of U.S. labor markets? The latest unemployment rate was 6.2 percent for July. This number is representative of the significant improvement in labor market conditions that we’ve seen since October 2009, when the unemployment rate was 10 percent. And I expect this number to fall further through the course of this year, to around 5.7 percent. However, this progress in the decline of the unemployment rate masks continued weakness in labor markets.\nThere are many ways to see this continued weakness. I’ll mention two that I see as especially significant. First, the fraction of people aged 25 to 54—our prime-aged potential workers—who actually have a job is still at a disturbingly low rate. Second, a historically high percentage of workers would like a full-time job, but can only find part-time work. Bottom line: I see labor markets as remaining some way from meeting the FOMC’s goal of full employment.\nSo I’ve told you that inflation rates will remain low for a number of years and that labor markets are still weak. It is important, I think, to understand the connection between these two phenomena. As I have discussed in greater detail in recent speeches, a persistently below-target inflation rate is a signal that the U.S. economy is not taking advantage of all of its available resources. If demand were sufficiently high to generate 2 percent inflation, the underutilized resources would be put to work. And the most important of those resources is the American people. There are many people in this country who want to work more hours, and our society is deprived of their production.\nAs bankers, you know this all too well. You see this underutilization of resources in your own communities. I began this talk describing the important link between what you do as community lenders and what we strive to achieve at the FOMC—namely, to put the economy’s resources to work. The FOMC’s low-interest rate policy in recent years has certainly provided some challenges for banks, but the Committee’s ultimate goal is one that we share with you—a stronger, growing economy that benefits all. On that, I’m sure we can all agree.\nThank you once again for the invitation to join you here today. I look forward to your questions.\n  Note\n* Thanks to Ron Feldman, David Fettig, Terry Fitzgerald, Paul Schreck and Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for their assistance with these remarks and the supporting materials.\n  Endnote\n1 These examples reflect a baseline scenario with a fixed set of key assumptions detailed on our website. The impact of new regulatory costs in our model includes the hiring of additional staff, which results in higher total compensation and lower profitability. We then analyze the changes in the distribution of community bank profitability.\n2 Chair Janet Yellen, Governor Daniel Tarullo and President Dennis Lockhart have all spoken to this issue in recent months.\n3 See the Summer 2013 Central Banker.\n\nNote*\n\nI want to thank Marshall and other ICBM officers and members for inviting me to your annual conference. I appreciate the opportunity to share my views on community banking with all of you, but just as importantly, I look forward to your questions and our discussion following my talk.

If historical patterns continue, the number will fall considerably. There will be just 263 banks in Minnesota in 2024, a 23 percent decline from 341 currently, assuming that consolidation over the next 10 years continues the trend seen over the past 30. Or we could assume a slower rate of consolidation, like the 14 percent decline from 1995 to 2005. That would put the number at 293 community banks 10 years from now.\n\nThis is an admittedly crude modeling approach. We have also constructed a more elaborate statistical model of the potential long-run decline in the number of banks in Minnesota. Our statistical model is based on the historical movement of banks into, and out of, different asset groupings. Some banks get larger and move from one size bucket to another, while other banks exit the industry altogether. This transitional model—which we use to forecast the number of banks in Minnesota one year out on our website—suggests that the number of banks in the state will fall to 282 in 10 years.\n\nI’ve discussed three different estimates. They all predict that the number of banks in Minnesota will fall sharply over the next 10 years—from the current 341 to a number in the high 200s. By way of comparison, the median decline in the number of banks for all states across all 10-year periods since 1985 is 25 percent, a bit higher than some of the estimates we provided.\n\nTo be clear, these forecasts are only estimates. They should be interpreted accordingly. The actual number of banks may turn out to be smaller—or, indeed, it might turn out be larger.\n\nI’ve already noted that it is a matter of considerable public policy concern if regulations, not market forces, are important causes of bank consolidation. Federal Reserve policymakers have recently discussed how better tailoring of supervision and regulation to community banks can be helpful in reducing the extent of this problem.2 The Federal Reserve does some tailoring already, but I think we should do more. I’ll mention two examples of the kind of tailoring that I have in mind. I’ll then turn to two additional steps we might consider.\n\nOn safety and soundness, the Federal Reserve and other agencies received excellent comments from community banks on the Basel III proposal. These comments led to changes to the proposed rule that reduce unnecessary burdens on smaller banks.3 Smaller banks can opt out from having their capital levels vary due to changes in particularly volatile aspects of income. The final rule also allows smaller institutions to continue to count certain types of stock or securities as capital, when larger banks cannot. I think the rule-making process worked well in this instance. Issuing a preliminary rule and receiving comments from bankers allowed the final regulation to better address the actual risks posed by community banks.\n\nOn the consumer side, the Federal Reserve has moved to a more risk-focused exam process, from the less flexible previous approach. The new framework allows our examiners to better tailor their exams to the consumer risks that a particular bank may actually pose. Many banks that the Minneapolis Fed supervises do not engage in activities that pose a high risk to consumer protection. And many also have a strong, documented record of compliance and relatively little change in operations. Under the new framework, examiners can more readily eliminate certain areas of review.\n\nThe benefits of the new consumer program go beyond a more focused scope. The new framework encourages more of our supervisory work to occur off-site, thereby reducing the on-site burden we put on community banks. At the same time, where there are potentially risky activities, the new framework allows for a deeper dive.\n\nIn sum, I think the new consumer exam framework epitomizes the tailoring we need. It’s based on an analytical approach aimed at improving supervision, and it also captures institution-specific details where appropriate.\n\nWhere can we engage in additional tailoring? Governor Daniel Tarullo has noted potential benefits in reviewing statutes that apply new regulations to all banks. Community banks may not create the risks that a specific regulation addresses. In that vein, he noted the so-called Volcker rule and Dodd-Frank incentive compensation requirements. I strongly agree with Governor Tarullo’s point that Congress and supervisors should exempt all community banks from certain regulations. Exempting is the best way to guard against regulatory trickle-down.\n\nA second fruitful approach to additional tailoring concerns supervision, not regulation. I worry that our current supervisory methods establish expectations that are too detailed across too many areas of bank operations and too wide a swath of banks. Alternatively, supervisors could concentrate on a smaller number of activities that we believe are correlated with bad outcomes. To be specific, supervisors could choose to focus on rapid loan growth, high lending concentrations, specific high-risk types of lending and wholesale funding strategies and skip some of the more detailed reviews. This shift in focus might generate higher returns to society, in terms of improved safety and soundness per dollar spent, than detailed work programs. To be clear: I’m suggesting a tailored approach, and so supervisors could retain the more comprehensive, proscriptive approach for larger, systemically important banks.\n\nI offer these ideas not as final prescriptions, but in the spirit of open inquiry. My main point is that we need to further investigate ways to tailor the supervision and regulation of community banks. For the remainder of my remarks, I will turn my attention to the country’s economic performance.\n\nHowever, don’t worry—I won’t have as much to say about the state of the economy as I did about community banking. I’m a member of the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—and, as a monetary policymaker, my discussion will be framed by the goals of monetary policy. Congress has charged the FOMC with making monetary policy so as to promote price stability and maximum employment. I’ll discuss the state of the macroeconomy in terms of these goals.\n\nLet me start with price stability. The FOMC has translated the price stability objective into an inflation rate goal of 2 percent per year. This inflation rate target refers to the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, price index. This is a measure of inflation that is based on the rate of increase in the prices of all goods and services, including those related to food and energy. That rate currently stands at 1.6 percent, which is below the FOMC’s target of 2 percent. In fact, the inflation rate has averaged 1.6 percent since the start of the recession six and a half years ago, and inflation is expected to remain low for some time. For example, the minutes from the June FOMC meeting reveal that the Federal Reserve Board staff outlook is for inflation to remain below 2 percent over the next few years.\n\nIn a similar vein, earlier this year, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) predicted that inflation will not reach 2 percent until 2018—more than 10 years after the beginning of the Great Recession. I agree with this forecast. This means that the FOMC is still a long way from meeting its targeted goal of price stability.\n\nThe second FOMC goal is to promote maximum employment. What, then, is the state of U.S. labor markets? The latest unemployment rate was 6.2 percent for July. This number is representative of the significant improvement in labor market conditions that we’ve seen since October 2009, when the unemployment rate was 10 percent. And I expect this number to fall further through the course of this year, to around 5.7 percent. However, this progress in the decline of the unemployment rate masks continued weakness in labor markets.\n\nThere are many ways to see this continued weakness. I’ll mention two that I see as especially significant. First, the fraction of people aged 25 to 54—our prime-aged potential workers—who actually have a job is still at a disturbingly low rate. Second, a historically high percentage of workers would like a full-time job, but can only find part-time work. Bottom line: I see labor markets as remaining some way from meeting the FOMC’s goal of full employment.\n\nSo I’ve told you that inflation rates will remain low for a number of years and that labor markets are still weak. It is important, I think, to understand the connection between these two phenomena. As I have discussed in greater detail in recent speeches, a persistently below-target inflation rate is a signal that the U.S. economy is not taking advantage of all of its available resources. If demand were sufficiently high to generate 2 percent inflation, the underutilized resources would be put to work. And the most important of those resources is the American people. There are many people in this country who want to work more hours, and our society is deprived of their production.\n\nAs bankers, you know this all too well. You see this underutilization of resources in your own communities. I began this talk describing the important link between what you do as community lenders and what we strive to achieve at the FOMC—namely, to put the economy’s resources to work. The FOMC’s low-interest rate policy in recent years has certainly provided some challenges for banks, but the Committee’s ultimate goal is one that we share with you—a stronger, growing economy that benefits all. On that, I’m sure we can all agree.\n\nThank you once again for the invitation to join you here today. I look forward to your questions."

It’s a pleasure to speak to the Partnership again.\nI’ll begin my speech with some basics about the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). But the bulk of my remarks should be viewed as a quarterly report of sorts. Your elected representatives, the Congress of the United States, have charged the Federal Reserve with achieving key macroeconomic goals. My speech will be a report to you, the Minnesota Business Partnership, about how the FOMC is doing in terms of achieving those goals. Please keep in mind, though, that I will be expressing my own views, and they are not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nI look forward to responding to, and learning from, your questions at the conclusion of my remarks.\nFederal Reserve System Basics\nLet me begin with some basics about the Federal Reserve System. I like to tell people that the Fed is a uniquely American institution. What do I mean by that? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve Banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our Bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts and includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\nEight times per year, the FOMC meets to set the path of interest rates over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve Banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. However, the Committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a rotating group of four other presidents. I’m one of those four presidents this year. In this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government, because representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations.\nAt those eight meetings, the FOMC decides on the level of monetary stimulus for the economy. I won’t get into too many details of what that term “monetary stimulus” means, although I’m more than happy to take questions about it later. For now, I’ll just make three high-level points. First, when the FOMC changes the level of stimulus, our actions tend to push inflation—that is, the rate of growth of prices—and employment in the same direction. Raising the level of stimulus puts upward pressure on both inflation and employment. Lowering the level of stimulus puts downward pressure on both inflation and employment. Second, the FOMC’s actions only affect inflation and employment with a lag, usually thought to be about one-and-a-half to two years. Finally, over the long run, monetary policy is the prime determinant of the overall rate of inflation in the economy, but many factors beyond monetary policy affect the long-run level of employment.\nWhat is the FOMC seeking to achieve by varying the level of monetary stimulus? Congress has charged the FOMC with making monetary policy to promote price stability and to promote maximum employment. The FOMC has interpreted the first goal, price stability, to mean keeping inflation close to 2 percent. The FOMC’s job is to vary monetary stimulus over time to meet these mandated objectives.\nThe remainder of my speech will take the form of a report to you about how the FOMC is doing in terms of meeting these goals set for us by your elected representatives in Congress.\nPrice Stability\nI will start with price stability. Again, operationally, the FOMC has translated this into keeping the rate of increase of the price level—that is, the inflation rate—close to 2 percent. Even more specifically, the FOMC uses what’s called the personal consumption expenditure price index, or PCE, to calculate inflation. This measure of inflation captures the rate of increase in all goods and services, including those related to food and energy.\nThe Great Recession is dated as starting in December 2007. Here’s a graph of how PCE inflation has behaved since that date.\nLarge chart\nThe main take-away is that, since the beginning of the Great Recession, the PCE inflation rate has averaged 1.5 percent per year.\nIn some sense, going back to 2007 is a little misleading, because the FOMC did not adopt its 2 percent inflation target until January 2012. However, even since that decision, PCE inflation has been running lower than 2 percent.\nSo, whether we look over the past six years or over the past two years, inflation has been running too low to be consistent with price stability. The good news is that the FOMC does expect inflation to turn back toward 2 percent. However, that return to 2 percent could take a long time. For example, the minutes from the April FOMC meeting reveal that the Federal Reserve Board staff outlook is for inflation to remain below 2 percent over the next few years. In a similar vein, earlier this year, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) predicted that inflation will not reach 2 percent until 2018—more than 10 years after the beginning of the Great Recession.\nThis subdued inflation forecast may be surprising to some of you. After all, as you look at the chart, you can see that PCE inflation has risen relatively rapidly over the past three months and is now 1.8 percent—very close to the FOMC’s target. But the chart also clearly shows that many large fluctuations in PCE inflation end up being purely transitory. To formulate an accurate forecast for inflation, we need to look through these transitory fluctuations, no matter how large they might be—and that’s not always easy.\nOf course, my forecast is only a forecast. I am extremely confident that the actual path of inflation over the next four years will turn out to be higher or lower than what I currently expect it to be! What you should take away, though, is that I currently see the probability of inflation’s averaging more than 2 percent over the next four years as being considerably lower than the probability of inflation’s averaging less than 2 percent over the next four years. And that’s why I conclude my discussion of inflation by saying that the FOMC is undershooting its price stability goal.\nLow Inflation: Why It Matters\nI’ve told you that inflation has been, is and will be too low relative to the FOMC’s target of 2 percent. But why should you care that inflation is too low? Isn’t it a good thing when goods and services aren’t as expensive to buy? There are two answers to this—very good—question.\nThe first answer is that borrowers and lenders in our economy count on the Federal Reserve to deliver the inflation rate it targeted. If inflation is higher than the target, lenders are harmed because they receive payments that are smaller than they expected in real terms. Put another way, they can buy fewer goods and services with their payments than they expected. If inflation is lower than the target, borrowers are harmed because they must make payments that are larger than they expected in real terms. Why is that? When inflation is below target, goods and services are indeed cheaper, but wages also tend to be lower. Depressed wages mean that a family’s mortgage payment consumes a larger fraction of the family’s income than they expected when they took out the loan. That unexpectedly high mortgage payment harms the family, and it’s a harm that the FOMC can prevent by achieving the inflation rate that it targeted.\nThe second answer is: You should care about below-target inflation because it signals a significant problem in our economy.\nLet me explain what I mean. At a basic level, you should think of prices as a signal about how our economy is using its available resources. In 2012, I had an experience that brought home this intuition in a very clear way. I visited Williston, on the western edge of North Dakota. As it is today, when I visited Williston, it was in the heart of a major oil boom. That boom was pushing hard on the physical resources—like roads, water, housing—available to Williston and pushing hard on the human resources available to Williston. The result was relatively high inflation.\nSo, when inflation is high compared to the Fed’s target, like it was in Williston, we know that demand is pushing hard on available resources. The converse is also true: Inflation is low compared to the Fed’s target when the demand for goods and services is too low to fully use the available resources in society. The low inflation in the United States tells us that resources are being wasted.\nWhat exactly are these wasted resources? There are multiple answers to this question—when demand is too low, lots of resources are left unused. But the biggest and most disturbing answer is our fellow Americans. There are many productive people in the United States available to work more hours, and our society is deprived of their production.\nThis key point is generally underappreciated. I’ve said that the FOMC is undershooting its price stability objective and is expected to continue to do so. But we should all keep in mind that this outcome—and especially the forecast for continued undershooting—typically means that the FOMC is also underperforming on its other objective of promoting maximum employment.\nShould the FOMC Make Up for Past Inflation Misses?\nI’ve described how I expect that the PCE inflation rate will run below the FOMC’s 2 percent target for several years—possibly until 2018. Let’s assume that forecast turns out to be right. This outcome raises a key policy question: How should the FOMC’s inflation goals in the years following 2018 be influenced by the undershooting of the inflation target in the preceding years?\nIn addressing this question, I’ll compare two possible approaches: the standard approach of inflation targeting and the more novel approach of price level targeting. Let me note before I begin that I won’t take a stand today on which of those approaches is better. My goal is simply to initiate a policy conversation about future—indeed, possibly far-off future—monetary policy choices.\nLarge chart\nThe FOMC announced its 2 percent inflation target in January 2012. Since that date, inflation has averaged about 1.4 percent per year. As I noted earlier, I anticipate that inflation will rise only slowly. As you know, the inflation rate is the growth rate of the price level—that is, how much people pay for a typical bundle of goods and services. Hence, the downside misses with respect to inflation cumulate into a significantly lower price level. If my inflation forecast is right, the price level in 2018 will be about 2.2 percent below what it would have been had the FOMC hit its inflation target over the preceding six years.\nHow should the FOMC respond to this shortfall in the price level? If the FOMC simply targets a 2 percent inflation rate after 2018, then the price level will be permanently 2.2 percent lower than was expected in 2012. This approach to policy—which is the standard one followed by most leading central banks around the world—is called inflation targeting. But there is an alternative: The FOMC could target a slightly higher inflation rate for a few years after 2018 in order to make up for the shortfall in the price level. This latter policy approach is often termed price level targeting.\nLarge chart\nWhy would the FOMC want to use price level targeting? There are two reasons—and they are closely related to the concerns about low inflation that I raised earlier.\nThe first reason is that price level targeting makes long-term contracts safer for borrowers and lenders. For example, suppose a family took out a 30-year mortgage in 2012, under the expectation that the FOMC would deliver on its commitment to keep inflation at 2 percent. Because inflation has been so low over the past two years, the borrower’s current repayments are now surprisingly expensive in real terms. (By “real terms,” I mean that the borrower has to give up a surprising amount of goods and services to be able to afford the repayments.) The FOMC can’t solve that problem today, of course. But if the FOMC uses inflation targeting, the borrower’s repayments are likely to remain surprisingly expensive in real terms even in 2042, 30 years after taking out the mortgage. In contrast, if the FOMC uses price level targeting, the borrower’s repayments in 2042 are likely to be close, in real terms, to what the borrower expected when originally taking on the loan.\nThe second reason that the FOMC might want to use price level targeting is that it would serve as an automatic stabilizer for the economy. As I described earlier, when demand is low, inflation tends to be below target. With price level targeting, the FOMC makes up for low inflation by using monetary policy to stimulate higher future inflation and higher future demand. But this prospect of higher future demand is an incentive for businesses to hire and invest more now. Thus, with price level targeting, the FOMC’s anticipated future policy choices automatically offset current adverse shocks.1\nI’ve framed the decision about inflation targeting versus price level targeting in terms of its impact on the FOMC’s future policy decisions. As I’ve just talked through, though, these future decisions have the potential to affect near-term macroeconomic outcomes. In particular, if the FOMC were to decide today to follow price level targeting, then businesses would anticipate more stimulative future monetary policy and, consequently, higher future demand. That expectation of higher demand would provide an additional incentive for them to hire and invest today. In this way, the FOMC’s decision about price level targeting—a decision about choices to be made several years from now—has the potential to affect the near-term speed of the economy’s recovery.\nI suspect that all of this sounds pretty dry to some of you. I assure you that the debate over price level versus inflation targeting is about as exciting as central banking can get! I’m certainly not trying to resolve that debate today. In particular, I’ve not talked at all about the thorny and important question of how the FOMC should respond to past overshooting of its inflation target. But I do think that the question of whether to target the inflation rate or the price level should be a subject for serious discussion among central bankers.\nMaximum Employment\nI’ve argued that the low inflation rate is a signal that the FOMC is underperforming with respect to its maximum employment objective. But we don’t need to rely on this signal to reach this conclusion. We can readily see this underperformance in numerous key metrics of labor market performance.\nLarge chart\nI’ll begin by showing you data on the evolution of the unemployment rate. In March 2007, the unemployment rate was 4.4 percent. It rose slowly throughout 2007 to reach 5 percent by the end of the year. The National Bureau of Economic Research dates the Great Recession as having begun in that month. In the wake of the recession, the unemployment rate reached a peak of 10 percent in October 2009.\nSince that date—over four years ago!—the unemployment rate has fallen slowly to 6.1 percent. While this decline reflects a welcome improvement, the current unemployment rate remains above most forecasts of its expected long-run level. Personally, I expect that, over the long run, the unemployment rate will converge to just over 5 percent.\nBut I would say that this measure could well overstate the degree of improvement in the U.S. labor market. To estimate the unemployment rate, the Census Bureau asks people two questions: Are you working? And, if not, have you looked for work in the past four weeks? The unemployment rate measures the ratio of the second number—the recent job searchers—to the sum of the two numbers (the recent job searchers and the workers). This means that the unemployment rate can decline for two reasons: because more people are finding work or because fewer people are looking for work. Much of the decline in the unemployment rate since October 2009 has occurred because the fraction of people who are looking for work has fallen. This characterization is borne out if we look at the evolution of the fraction of people over the age of 16 who have a job—what’s called the employment-to-population ratio.\nLarge chart\nIn March 2007, the employment-to-population ratio was over 63 percent. The employment-to-population ratio fell sharply during the Great Recession and bottomed out at just over 58 percent in mid-2011. The percentage has risen little from this low point and remains lower than at any time between 1986 and 2007.\nIt is true that, even without the Great Recession, demographic forces would have led to some decline in the employment-to-population ratio since 2007. As the baby boom birth cohort—born between 1946 and 1964—ages, the fraction of retirees in the population grows steadily. But these demographic forces are still not large enough to account for most of the decline in the employment-to-population ratio that I’ve described. One way to see this—but not the only way—is to focus on people who are outside the normal retirement age. Here, I’ve plotted the fraction of the population aged 25 to 54 who have a job. This ratio has improved from its low point, but also remains lower than at any time between 1986 and 2007.\nLarge chart\nEven among those who have a job, there are signs that the economy is significantly underemploying our human resources. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports each month on the number of Americans who are working part time, would like to work more hours, but are unable to obtain those additional hours. That fraction of the labor force has fallen, but remains unusually high.\nLarge chart\nTo summarize what we learn from the charts: The good news is that the labor market has improved since the end of the Great Recession. The bad news is that the rate of improvement over the past four-plus years has been painfully slow. As a consequence, there is still significant underutilization of our country’s most important resource—its people. We have to conclude that the FOMC is underperforming with respect to its goal of promoting maximum employment.\nConclusions\nEarlier, I asked you to consider this speech as a report to you on the FOMC’s performance with respect to its two congressionally mandated objectives. We’ve seen that the FOMC is undershooting its price stability objective, in that inflation is running below the FOMC’s goal of 2 percent and is expected to remain low for several years. The undershooting is problematic because it suggests that the American economy is wasting available resources, especially its human resources. We’ve seen evidence of this underutilization in the performance of key labor market metrics. Hence, the FOMC is also underperforming with respect to its maximum employment objective. I continue to believe that we need to do better as a Committee.\nThank you for listening.

To formulate an accurate forecast for inflation, we need to look through these transitory fluctuations, no matter how large they might be—and that’s not always easy.\n\nOf course, my forecast is only a forecast. I am extremely confident that the actual path of inflation over the next four years will turn out to be higher or lower than what I currently expect it to be! What you should take away, though, is that I currently see the probability of inflation’s averaging more than 2 percent over the next four years as being considerably lower than the probability of inflation’s averaging less than 2 percent over the next four years. And that’s why I conclude my discussion of inflation by saying that the FOMC is undershooting its price stability goal.\n\nI’ve told you that inflation has been, is and will be too low relative to the FOMC’s target of 2 percent. But why should you care that inflation is too low? Isn’t it a good thing when goods and services aren’t as expensive to buy? There are two answers to this—very good—question.\n\nThe first answer is that borrowers and lenders in our economy count on the Federal Reserve to deliver the inflation rate it targeted. If inflation is higher than the target, lenders are harmed because they receive payments that are smaller than they expected in real terms. Put another way, they can buy fewer goods and services with their payments than they expected. If inflation is lower than the target, borrowers are harmed because they must make payments that are larger than they expected in real terms. Why is that? When inflation is below target, goods and services are indeed cheaper, but wages also tend to be lower. Depressed wages mean that a family’s mortgage payment consumes a larger fraction of the family’s income than they expected when they took out the loan. That unexpectedly high mortgage payment harms the family, and it’s a harm that the FOMC can prevent by achieving the inflation rate that it targeted.\n\nThe second answer is: You should care about below-target inflation because it signals a significant problem in our economy.\n\nLet me explain what I mean. At a basic level, you should think of prices as a signal about how our economy is using its available resources. In 2012, I had an experience that brought home this intuition in a very clear way. I visited Williston, on the western edge of North Dakota. As it is today, when I visited Williston, it was in the heart of a major oil boom. That boom was pushing hard on the physical resources—like roads, water, housing—available to Williston and pushing hard on the human resources available to Williston. The result was relatively high inflation.\n\nSo, when inflation is high compared to the Fed’s target, like it was in Williston, we know that demand is pushing hard on available resources. The converse is also true: Inflation is low compared to the Fed’s target when the demand for goods and services is too low to fully use the available resources in society. The low inflation in the United States tells us that resources are being wasted.\n\nWhat exactly are these wasted resources? There are multiple answers to this question—when demand is too low, lots of resources are left unused. But the biggest and most disturbing answer is our fellow Americans. There are many productive people in the United States available to work more hours, and our society is deprived of their production.\n\nThis key point is generally underappreciated. I’ve said that the FOMC is undershooting its price stability objective and is expected to continue to do so. But we should all keep in mind that this outcome—and especially the forecast for continued undershooting—typically means that the FOMC is also underperforming on its other objective of promoting maximum employment.\n\nI’ve described how I expect that the PCE inflation rate will run below the FOMC’s 2 percent target for several years—possibly until 2018. Let’s assume that forecast turns out to be right. This outcome raises a key policy question: How should the FOMC’s inflation goals in the years following 2018 be influenced by the undershooting of the inflation target in the preceding years?\n\nIn addressing this question, I’ll compare two possible approaches: the standard approach of inflation targeting and the more novel approach of price level targeting. Let me note before I begin that I won’t take a stand today on which of those approaches is better. My goal is simply to initiate a policy conversation about future—indeed, possibly far-off future—monetary policy choices.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nThe FOMC announced its 2 percent inflation target in January 2012. Since that date, inflation has averaged about 1.4 percent per year. As I noted earlier, I anticipate that inflation will rise only slowly. As you know, the inflation rate is the growth rate of the price level—that is, how much people pay for a typical bundle of goods and services. Hence, the downside misses with respect to inflation cumulate into a significantly lower price level. If my inflation forecast is right, the price level in 2018 will be about 2.2 percent below what it would have been had the FOMC hit its inflation target over the preceding six years.\n\nHow should the FOMC respond to this shortfall in the price level? If the FOMC simply targets a 2 percent inflation rate after 2018, then the price level will be permanently 2.2 percent lower than was expected in 2012. This approach to policy—which is the standard one followed by most leading central banks around the world—is called inflation targeting. But there is an alternative: The FOMC could target a slightly higher inflation rate for a few years after 2018 in order to make up for the shortfall in the price level. This latter policy approach is often termed price level targeting.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nWhy would the FOMC want to use price level targeting? There are two reasons—and they are closely related to the concerns about low inflation that I raised earlier.\n\nThe first reason is that price level targeting makes long-term contracts safer for borrowers and lenders. For example, suppose a family took out a 30-year mortgage in 2012, under the expectation that the FOMC would deliver on its commitment to keep inflation at 2 percent. Because inflation has been so low over the past two years, the borrower’s current repayments are now surprisingly expensive in real terms. (By “real terms,” I mean that the borrower has to give up a surprising amount of goods and services to be able to afford the repayments.) The FOMC can’t solve that problem today, of course. But if the FOMC uses inflation targeting, the borrower’s repayments are likely to remain surprisingly expensive in real terms even in 2042, 30 years after taking out the mortgage. In contrast, if the FOMC uses price level targeting, the borrower’s repayments in 2042 are likely to be close, in real terms, to what the borrower expected when originally taking on the loan.\n\nThe second reason that the FOMC might want to use price level targeting is that it would serve as an automatic stabilizer for the economy. As I described earlier, when demand is low, inflation tends to be below target. With price level targeting, the FOMC makes up for low inflation by using monetary policy to stimulate higher future inflation and higher future demand. But this prospect of higher future demand is an incentive for businesses to hire and invest more now. Thus, with price level targeting, the FOMC’s anticipated future policy choices automatically offset current adverse shocks.1\n\nI’ve framed the decision about inflation targeting versus price level targeting in terms of its impact on the FOMC’s future policy decisions. As I’ve just talked through, though, these future decisions have the potential to affect near-term macroeconomic outcomes. In particular, if the FOMC were to decide today to follow price level targeting, then businesses would anticipate more stimulative future monetary policy and, consequently, higher future demand. That expectation of higher demand would provide an additional incentive for them to hire and invest today. In this way, the FOMC’s decision about price level targeting—a decision about choices to be made several years from now—has the potential to affect the near-term speed of the economy’s recovery.\n\nI suspect that all of this sounds pretty dry to some of you. I assure you that the debate over price level versus inflation targeting is about as exciting as central banking can get! I’m certainly not trying to resolve that debate today. In particular, I’ve not talked at all about the thorny and important question of how the FOMC should respond to past overshooting of its inflation target. But I do think that the question of whether to target the inflation rate or the price level should be a subject for serious discussion among central bankers.\n\nI’ve argued that the low inflation rate is a signal that the FOMC is underperforming with respect to its maximum employment objective. But we don’t need to rely on this signal to reach this conclusion. We can readily see this underperformance in numerous key metrics of labor market performance.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nI’ll begin by showing you data on the evolution of the unemployment rate. In March 2007, the unemployment rate was 4.4 percent. It rose slowly throughout 2007 to reach 5 percent by the end of the year. The National Bureau of Economic Research dates the Great Recession as having begun in that month. In the wake of the recession, the unemployment rate reached a peak of 10 percent in October 2009.\n\nSince that date—over four years ago!—the unemployment rate has fallen slowly to 6.1 percent. While this decline reflects a welcome improvement, the current unemployment rate remains above most forecasts of its expected long-run level. Personally, I expect that, over the long run, the unemployment rate will converge to just over 5 percent.\n\nBut I would say that this measure could well overstate the degree of improvement in the U.S. labor market. To estimate the unemployment rate, the Census Bureau asks people two questions: Are you working? And, if not, have you looked for work in the past four weeks? The unemployment rate measures the ratio of the second number—the recent job searchers—to the sum of the two numbers (the recent job searchers and the workers). This means that the unemployment rate can decline for two reasons: because more people are finding work or because fewer people are looking for work. Much of the decline in the unemployment rate since October 2009 has occurred because the fraction of people who are looking for work has fallen. This characterization is borne out if we look at the evolution of the fraction of people over the age of 16 who have a job—what’s called the employment-to-population ratio.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nIn March 2007, the employment-to-population ratio was over 63 percent. The employment-to-population ratio fell sharply during the Great Recession and bottomed out at just over 58 percent in mid-2011. The percentage has risen little from this low point and remains lower than at any time between 1986 and 2007.\n\nIt is true that, even without the Great Recession, demographic forces would have led to some decline in the employment-to-population ratio since 2007. As the baby boom birth cohort—born between 1946 and 1964—ages, the fraction of retirees in the population grows steadily. But these demographic forces are still not large enough to account for most of the decline in the employment-to-population ratio that I’ve described. One way to see this—but not the only way—is to focus on people who are outside the normal retirement age. Here, I’ve plotted the fraction of the population aged 25 to 54 who have a job. This ratio has improved from its low point, but also remains lower than at any time between 1986 and 2007.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nEven among those who have a job, there are signs that the economy is significantly underemploying our human resources. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports each month on the number of Americans who are working part time, would like to work more hours, but are unable to obtain those additional hours. That fraction of the labor force has fallen, but remains unusually high.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nTo summarize what we learn from the charts: The good news is that the labor market has improved since the end of the Great Recession. The bad news is that the rate of improvement over the past four-plus years has been painfully slow. As a consequence, there is still significant underutilization of our country’s most important resource—its people. We have to conclude that the FOMC is underperforming with respect to its goal of promoting maximum employment.\n\nEarlier, I asked you to consider this speech as a report to you on the FOMC’s performance with respect to its two congressionally mandated objectives. We’ve seen that the FOMC is undershooting its price stability objective, in that inflation is running below the FOMC’s goal of 2 percent and is expected to remain low for several years. The undershooting is problematic because it suggests that the American economy is wasting available resources, especially its human resources. We’ve seen evidence of this underutilization in the performance of key labor market metrics. Hence, the FOMC is also underperforming with respect to its maximum employment objective. I continue to believe that we need to do better as a Committee.\n\nThank you for listening. I’d be happy to take your questions."

            "content": "Note*\nIntroduction\nThanks for the invitation to speak at this great conference.\nIn my talk today, I will provide some perspectives on appropriate monetary policy and financial stability. I start by arguing that, over the past seven years, we have seen dramatic changes in the demand for and supply of safe assets. Given those changes, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is only able to achieve its congressionally mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability by taking actions that serve to keep the real—that is, net of inflation—interest rate well below its 2007 level. I suggest that these changes in asset demand and asset supply are likely to persist over a considerable period of time—possibly the next five years or so. It follows that the FOMC will only be able to meet its objectives over that time frame by taking policy actions that ensure that real interest rates remain unusually low.\nI then point out that low real interest rates are often associated with financial market phenomena that are seen as signifying instability. It follows that, for many years to come, the FOMC will only be able to achieve its congressionally mandated objectives by following policies that may result in signs of financial market instability.\nFinally, I discuss how the FOMC should take those signs of instability into account when formulating monetary policy.\nBefore proceeding I need to stress that my remarks today reflect only my views and not necessarily those of any other FOMC participant.\nLow Real Interest Rates\nEconomists generally distinguish between nominal and real interest rates. The nominal interest rate is the interest rate reported on a typical savings account or mortgage. It tells you how many dollars a saver or a lender will get in the future for giving up a dollar today. The real interest rate adjusts those future dollars for the anticipated rate of price increases—that is, for the anticipated rate of inflation. This means that the real interest rate tells you how much purchasing power a saver or lender will get in the future for giving up a dollar of purchasing power today.\nWhen I was a student, back in the seventies and eighties, the real interest rate was a somewhat mysterious, unobservable object. That’s no longer true. Treasury inflation-protected securities—bonds that are colloquially called TIPS—make coupon payments that are indexed to the inflation rate. This indexation means that TIPS coupon payments provide a fixed amount of purchasing power to the bondholder, not a fixed amount of dollars. As a result, TIPS yields provide a useful measure of the real interest rate.\nWhen we look at TIPS yields, we see that real interest rates have fallen sharply over the past six years. In the first half of 2007, five-year TIPS had a real yield of about 2.5 percent and 10-year TIPS also had a real yield of about 2.5 percent. By 2012, both real yields had fallen well below zero, and while they have risen slightly, real yields continue to be low today. The five-year real TIPS yield is still below zero, around negative 0.3 percent. The 10-year real TIPS yield is only slightly positive—around 0.4 percent. Note that, together, these market prices imply that the five year-five year forward real interest rate is around 1 percent. The 10 year-10 year forward real interest rate is only slightly higher.\nWhy have real interest rates fallen so much? At one level, the answer is obvious: monetary policy. Certainly, over the past seven years, the FOMC has taken a number of actions designed to put downward pressure on nominal bond yields. With inflationary expectations well-anchored, these actions tend to push downward on real interest rates.\nBut I think that the obvious monetary policy answer is actually deeply misleading. It is true that the FOMC takes monetary policy actions so as to influence the real interest rate. But, ultimately, these actions are designed to allow the FOMC to achieve its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. In 2007, the macroeconomic outlook was broadly consistent with the Committee’s mandated objectives. In this sense, we can say that the real interest rate of 2.5 percent was mandate-consistent1 in 2007.\nThe situation is different in 2014. As I’ve argued in previous speeches, the outlook for both employment and prices is too low relative to the FOMC’s goals. For example, Personal Consumption Expenditure inflation—the Fed’s preferred measure—is currently at 1.6 percent. I expect it to remain below the FOMC’s inflation target of 2 percent for several years. This subdued outlook for both prices and employment suggests that the current path of real interest rates is actually too high to be consistent with the FOMC’s mandated macroeconomic outcomes. Hence, I would argue that the mandate-consistent real interest rate is even lower than is suggested by the current yield on TIPS.\nWhat Happened?\nI’ve argued that the mandate-consistent path of real interest rates has fallen since 2007. I now turn to a discussion of why this has happened. I see the decline in mandate-consistent real interest rates as grounded in an increase in the demand for, and a fall in the supply of, safe financial investment vehicles. Importantly, I see these changes as likely to be highly persistent.\nThere are many factors underlying the increased demand for safe assets. I’ll discuss three that strike me as particularly important: tighter credit access, heightened perceptions of macroeconomic risk and increased uncertainty about federal fiscal policy.\nIn terms of credit access, I don’t think that it’s controversial to say that credit access is more limited than in 2007. What is less generally realized, I think, is that restrictions on households’ and businesses’ ability to borrow typically lead them to spend less and save more.\nI can best illustrate this point through an example. Consider a household that wants to purchase a new home. In 2007, that household could have received a mortgage with a down payment of 10 percent of the purchase price, or even lower. In 2014, that same household is considerably more likely to need a down payment of 20 percent. These tighter mortgage standards mean that, to buy a similarly priced house, the household needs to first acquire more assets.\nThus, the demand for safe assets has risen because of tighter limits on credit access. It has also risen because of households’ and businesses’ assessments of macroeconomic risk. As of 2007, the United States had just gone through nearly 25 years of macroeconomic tranquility. As a consequence, relatively few workers or businesses (or macroeconomists!) in the United States saw a severe macroeconomic shock as a relevant contingency.\nHowever, in the wake of the Great Recession and the Not-So-Great Recovery, the story is different. Now, more workers see themselves as being exposed to the risk of persistent deterioration in labor incomes. More businesses see themselves as being exposed to the risk of a radical and persistent downshift in the demand for their products. These workers and businesses have an incentive to accumulate more safe assets as a way to self-insure against this enhanced macroeconomic risk.\nThe federal fiscal situation is the third key source of elevated uncertainty. The federal government faces a long-run disconnect between its overt commitments and the baseline path of federal tax collections. This disconnect can only be resolved by raising taxes and/or cutting the long-run arc of spending.\nOf course, this tension between revenues and expenditures predated the 2007 downturn. However, it is at least arguable that the fiscal debates of the past few years have made more Americans aware of the uncertainties associated with resolving this long-run disconnect. And these uncertainties affect the demand for safe assets. The possibility of higher future taxes on corporate profits gives businesses an incentive to demand safe short-term financial assets as opposed to engaging in long-term investments. The prospect of reductions in Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security gives some households an incentive to demand more safe assets as a way of replacing those lost potential benefits.\nI’ve argued that, due in part to tighter credit access and higher uncertainty, the demand for safe financial assets has risen since 2007. At the same time, the global supply of assets perceived as safe has also fallen. Americans—and many others around the world—thought in 2007 that it was highly unlikely that American residential land, and assets backed by land, could ever fall in value by 30 percent. Not anymore. Similarly, investors around the world viewed all forms of European sovereign debt as a safe investment. Not anymore.\nThus, the FOMC is confronted with a greater demand for safe assets and tighter supply of safe assets than in 2007. These changes in asset markets mean that, at any given level of real interest rates, households and businesses spend less. Their decline in spending pushes down on both prices and employment. As a result, the FOMC has to lower the real interest rate to achieve its objectives.2\nI often hear that the FOMC has created a low interest rate environment that is harmful for savers and others. In my view, like savers, the FOMC is being forced to make unusual decisions by an unusual economic environment that is not of its own making. The FOMC has been confronted with a significant increase in safe asset demand and a significant fall in safe asset supply. Faced with these changes, the Committee can only achieve its macroeconomic objectives by taking actions to push down the real interest rate. Indeed, as I argued earlier, the subdued outlook for prices and employment suggests that the FOMC’s actions have not lowered the real interest rate sufficiently.\nWhat about the future? The passage of time will ameliorate these changes in the demand for and supply of safe assets—but only partially. Any long-run forecast has enormous attendant uncertainties. But I expect that for a considerable period of time—possibly the next five years or more—credit market access will remain limited relative to what borrowers had available in 2007. I expect that many workers and businesses will remain more concerned than in 2007 about the risk of a large adverse shock. And I also expect that businesses will continue to feel a heightened degree of uncertainty about taxes and households will continue to feel a heightened degree of uncertainty about the level of federal government benefits. These considerations suggest that, for many years to come, the FOMC will have to maintain low real interest rates to achieve its congressionally mandated goals. I see this conclusion as broadly consistent with the April FOMC statement, which predicts that the target fed funds rate will remain low for some time after inflation and employment are near mandate-consistent levels.\nFinancial Market Outcomes Associated with Low Real Interest Rates\nI have argued that, for some time to come, the FOMC will only be able to achieve its dual mandate outcomes if the time path of real interest rates is considerably lower than in 2007—as much as two full percentage points lower.\nI now turn to the consequences of these unusually low real interest rates for broader financial market conditions. My main point is that unusually low real interest rates are likely to be associated with other unusual financial market outcomes. I’ll discuss three of these outcomes in some detail: inflated asset prices, unusually volatile asset returns and high merger activity.\nThe first consequence of low real interest rates that I mentioned—higher asset prices—is the most obvious. Long-lived assets are somewhat substitutable for each other. Hence, investors generally respond to low real yields on bonds by bidding up the price of other long-lived assets—including gold, land, stocks or machines. It follows that when real interest rates are unusually low by historical norms, asset prices will typically be unusually high relative to historical norms.\nThe second consequence of low real interest rates is that asset returns should be expected to be highly volatile. When the real interest rate is very high, only the near term matters to investors. Hence, variations in an asset’s price only reflect changes in investors’ information about the asset’s near-term dividends or risk premiums. But when the real interest rate is unusually low, then an asset’s price will become correspondingly sensitive to information about dividends or risk premiums in the distant future. This new source of relevant information should be expected to induce more variability into asset prices and returns.3\nFinally, I believe that when real interest rates are low, we should expect to see more mergers. Mergers typically involve enduring current costs in exchange for a flow of future benefits. For example, to initiate the merger, the acquiring firm has to search for an appropriate target, and that search can be costly. As well, after the merger, it may be necessary to undertake a one-time costly reorganization of people and materiel to achieve the anticipated gains in revenue. Businesses will be more willing to pay the upfront costs of a merger in exchange for the anticipated flow of future benefits associated with the merger if the real interest rate is low.4\nIn this way, unusually low real interest rates should be expected to be linked with inflated asset prices, high asset return volatility and heightened merger activity. All of these financial market outcomes are often interpreted as signifying financial market instability. And this observation brings me to a key conclusion. I’ve suggested that it is likely that, for a number of years to come, the FOMC will only achieve its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability if its actions are able to keep real interest rates unusually low. I’ve also argued that when real interest rates are low, we are likely to see financial market outcomes that signify instability. It follows that, for a considerable period of time, the FOMC may only be able to achieve its macroeconomic objectives in association with signs of instability in financial markets.\nFinancial Stability and Monetary Policy\nThese financial market phenomena could pose macroeconomic risks. In my view, such potentialities are best addressed through effective supervision and regulation of the financial sector. It is possible, though, that these tools may only partially mitigate the relevant macroeconomic risks. How, if at all, should the FOMC adapt monetary policy in response to any residual risk?\nIn remarks that I gave earlier this year, I described an analytical mean-variance framework that the Committee could use to answer this question.5 Today, I’ll simply sketch the elements of that framework. Basically, the FOMC will need to confront an ongoing probabilistic cost-benefit calculation. On the one hand, raising the real interest rate will definitely lead to lower employment and prices. On the other hand, raising the real interest rate may reduce the risk of a financial crisis—a crisis that could give rise to a much larger fall in employment and prices. Thus, the Committee has to weigh the certainty of a costly deviation from its dual mandate objectives against the benefit of reducing the probability of an even larger deviation from those objectives.\nIn my view, this cost-benefit assessment is relatively clear right now. As I mentioned earlier, employment and prices are expected to be quite low over the medium term. In these circumstances, the cost of tightening policy has to be seen as great. At the same time, the Survey of Professional Forecasters reveals that forecasters see little chance of a large downward movement in employment and prices. These forecasts suggest that there would be little gain, in terms of forestalling adverse macroeconomic outcomes, from monetary policy tightening.\nHowever, I expect this assessment to become more difficult for monetary policymakers in the future. Eventually, the outlook for employment and prices will improve to be broadly consistent with the FOMC’s objectives. As I’ve described, I expect that the real interest rate will still be unusually low at that juncture. In these circumstances, I anticipate that financial stability considerations are likely to play a substantial role in the determination of the appropriate level of monetary accommodation.\nI should stress that the Committee is in a better position to carry out this kind of probabilistic cost-benefit analysis in 2014 than it was in 2007. The Federal Reserve System now dedicates a significant amount of our best staff resources to financial system surveillance. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis contributes to these efforts in a number of ways, including our ongoing monitoring of the risk-neutral probability distributions of future asset values.6 As a result of these efforts, the FOMC has a lot more information, on an ongoing basis, about the extent of financial system risks.\nNonetheless, as always, there is more to be learned. We need to understand better, in light of the current state of supervision and regulation, which residual financial system risks have the potential to translate into macroeconomic risks. And we need to understand better to what extent monetary policy tightening can in fact temper those residual financial system risks.\nConclusions\nLet me wrap up.\nOver the past seven years, there have been big changes in the demand for and supply of safe assets. These changes seem likely to be persistent, and they mean that the FOMC may need to keep real interest rates unusually low for years if it is to achieve its objectives of maximum employment and price stability. I see this conclusion as broadly consistent with the last sentence of the FOMC’s April statement.\nIt follows that, to attain maximum employment and price stability over the same long period of time, Americans will likely face the consequences of low real interest rates. I’ve emphasized consequences related to financial market instability, like inflated asset prices, volatile asset returns and heightened merger activity. Even in the presence of effective supervision and regulation, these phenomena could pose residual macroeconomic risks. The FOMC’s decision about whether to respond to those residual risks using the rather blunt tool of monetary policy will necessarily depend on a delicate probabilistic cost-benefit calculation.\nThanks for listening.

It follows that the FOMC will only be able to meet its objectives over that time frame by taking policy actions that ensure that real interest rates remain unusually low.\n\nI then point out that low real interest rates are often associated with financial market phenomena that are seen as signifying instability. It follows that, for many years to come, the FOMC will only be able to achieve its congressionally mandated objectives by following policies that may result in signs of financial market instability.\n\nFinally, I discuss how the FOMC should take those signs of instability into account when formulating monetary policy.\n\nBefore proceeding I need to stress that my remarks today reflect only my views and not necessarily those of any other FOMC participant.\n\nEconomists generally distinguish between nominal and real interest rates. The nominal interest rate is the interest rate reported on a typical savings account or mortgage. It tells you how many dollars a saver or a lender will get in the future for giving up a dollar today. The real interest rate adjusts those future dollars for the anticipated rate of price increases—that is, for the anticipated rate of inflation. This means that the real interest rate tells you how much purchasing power a saver or lender will get in the future for giving up a dollar of purchasing power today.\n\nWhen I was a student, back in the seventies and eighties, the real interest rate was a somewhat mysterious, unobservable object. That’s no longer true. Treasury inflation-protected securities—bonds that are colloquially called TIPS—make coupon payments that are indexed to the inflation rate. This indexation means that TIPS coupon payments provide a fixed amount of purchasing power to the bondholder, not a fixed amount of dollars. As a result, TIPS yields provide a useful measure of the real interest rate.\n\nWhen we look at TIPS yields, we see that real interest rates have fallen sharply over the past six years. In the first half of 2007, five-year TIPS had a real yield of about 2.5 percent and 10-year TIPS also had a real yield of about 2.5 percent. By 2012, both real yields had fallen well below zero, and while they have risen slightly, real yields continue to be low today. The five-year real TIPS yield is still below zero, around negative 0.3 percent. The 10-year real TIPS yield is only slightly positive—around 0.4 percent. Note that, together, these market prices imply that the five year-five year forward real interest rate is around 1 percent. The 10 year-10 year forward real interest rate is only slightly higher.\n\nWhy have real interest rates fallen so much? At one level, the answer is obvious: monetary policy. Certainly, over the past seven years, the FOMC has taken a number of actions designed to put downward pressure on nominal bond yields. With inflationary expectations well-anchored, these actions tend to push downward on real interest rates.\n\nBut I think that the obvious monetary policy answer is actually deeply misleading. It is true that the FOMC takes monetary policy actions so as to influence the real interest rate. But, ultimately, these actions are designed to allow the FOMC to achieve its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. In 2007, the macroeconomic outlook was broadly consistent with the Committee’s mandated objectives. In this sense, we can say that the real interest rate of 2.5 percent was mandate-consistent1 in 2007.\n\nThe situation is different in 2014. As I’ve argued in previous speeches, the outlook for both employment and prices is too low relative to the FOMC’s goals. For example, Personal Consumption Expenditure inflation—the Fed’s preferred measure—is currently at 1.6 percent. I expect it to remain below the FOMC’s inflation target of 2 percent for several years. This subdued outlook for both prices and employment suggests that the current path of real interest rates is actually too high to be consistent with the FOMC’s mandated macroeconomic outcomes. Hence, I would argue that the mandate-consistent real interest rate is even lower than is suggested by the current yield on TIPS.\n\nI’ve argued that the mandate-consistent path of real interest rates has fallen since 2007. I now turn to a discussion of why this has happened. I see the decline in mandate-consistent real interest rates as grounded in an increase in the demand for, and a fall in the supply of, safe financial investment vehicles. Importantly, I see these changes as likely to be highly persistent.\n\nThere are many factors underlying the increased demand for safe assets. I’ll discuss three that strike me as particularly important: tighter credit access, heightened perceptions of macroeconomic risk and increased uncertainty about federal fiscal policy.\n\nIn terms of credit access, I don’t think that it’s controversial to say that credit access is more limited than in 2007. What is less generally realized, I think, is that restrictions on households’ and businesses’ ability to borrow typically lead them to spend less and save more.\n\nI can best illustrate this point through an example. Consider a household that wants to purchase a new home. In 2007, that household could have received a mortgage with a down payment of 10 percent of the purchase price, or even lower. In 2014, that same household is considerably more likely to need a down payment of 20 percent. These tighter mortgage standards mean that, to buy a similarly priced house, the household needs to first acquire more assets.\n\nThus, the demand for safe assets has risen because of tighter limits on credit access. It has also risen because of households’ and businesses’ assessments of macroeconomic risk. As of 2007, the United States had just gone through nearly 25 years of macroeconomic tranquility. As a consequence, relatively few workers or businesses (or macroeconomists!) in the United States saw a severe macroeconomic shock as a relevant contingency.\n\nHowever, in the wake of the Great Recession and the Not-So-Great Recovery, the story is different. Now, more workers see themselves as being exposed to the risk of persistent deterioration in labor incomes. More businesses see themselves as being exposed to the risk of a radical and persistent downshift in the demand for their products. These workers and businesses have an incentive to accumulate more safe assets as a way to self-insure against this enhanced macroeconomic risk.\n\nThe federal fiscal situation is the third key source of elevated uncertainty. The federal government faces a long-run disconnect between its overt commitments and the baseline path of federal tax collections. This disconnect can only be resolved by raising taxes and/or cutting the long-run arc of spending.\n\nOf course, this tension between revenues and expenditures predated the 2007 downturn. However, it is at least arguable that the fiscal debates of the past few years have made more Americans aware of the uncertainties associated with resolving this long-run disconnect. And these uncertainties affect the demand for safe assets. The possibility of higher future taxes on corporate profits gives businesses an incentive to demand safe short-term financial assets as opposed to engaging in long-term investments. The prospect of reductions in Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security gives some households an incentive to demand more safe assets as a way of replacing those lost potential benefits.\n\nI’ve argued that, due in part to tighter credit access and higher uncertainty, the demand for safe financial assets has risen since 2007. At the same time, the global supply of assets perceived as safe has also fallen. Americans—and many others around the world—thought in 2007 that it was highly unlikely that American residential land, and assets backed by land, could ever fall in value by 30 percent. Not anymore. Similarly, investors around the world viewed all forms of European sovereign debt as a safe investment. Not anymore.\n\nThus, the FOMC is confronted with a greater demand for safe assets and tighter supply of safe assets than in 2007. These changes in asset markets mean that, at any given level of real interest rates, households and businesses spend less. Their decline in spending pushes down on both prices and employment. As a result, the FOMC has to lower the real interest rate to achieve its objectives.2\n\nI often hear that the FOMC has created a low interest rate environment that is harmful for savers and others. In my view, like savers, the FOMC is being forced to make unusual decisions by an unusual economic environment that is not of its own making. The FOMC has been confronted with a significant increase in safe asset demand and a significant fall in safe asset supply. Faced with these changes, the Committee can only achieve its macroeconomic objectives by taking actions to push down the real interest rate. Indeed, as I argued earlier, the subdued outlook for prices and employment suggests that the FOMC’s actions have not lowered the real interest rate sufficiently.\n\nWhat about the future? The passage of time will ameliorate these changes in the demand for and supply of safe assets—but only partially. Any long-run forecast has enormous attendant uncertainties. But I expect that for a considerable period of time—possibly the next five years or more—credit market access will remain limited relative to what borrowers had available in 2007. I expect that many workers and businesses will remain more concerned than in 2007 about the risk of a large adverse shock. And I also expect that businesses will continue to feel a heightened degree of uncertainty about taxes and households will continue to feel a heightened degree of uncertainty about the level of federal government benefits. These considerations suggest that, for many years to come, the FOMC will have to maintain low real interest rates to achieve its congressionally mandated goals. I see this conclusion as broadly consistent with the April FOMC statement, which predicts that the target fed funds rate will remain low for some time after inflation and employment are near mandate-consistent levels.\n\nI have argued that, for some time to come, the FOMC will only be able to achieve its dual mandate outcomes if the time path of real interest rates is considerably lower than in 2007—as much as two full percentage points lower.\n\nI now turn to the consequences of these unusually low real interest rates for broader financial market conditions. My main point is that unusually low real interest rates are likely to be associated with other unusual financial market outcomes. I’ll discuss three of these outcomes in some detail: inflated asset prices, unusually volatile asset returns and high merger activity.\n\nThe first consequence of low real interest rates that I mentioned—higher asset prices—is the most obvious. Long-lived assets are somewhat substitutable for each other. Hence, investors generally respond to low real yields on bonds by bidding up the price of other long-lived assets—including gold, land, stocks or machines. It follows that when real interest rates are unusually low by historical norms, asset prices will typically be unusually high relative to historical norms.\n\nThe second consequence of low real interest rates is that asset returns should be expected to be highly volatile. When the real interest rate is very high, only the near term matters to investors. Hence, variations in an asset’s price only reflect changes in investors’ information about the asset’s near-term dividends or risk premiums. But when the real interest rate is unusually low, then an asset’s price will become correspondingly sensitive to information about dividends or risk premiums in the distant future. This new source of relevant information should be expected to induce more variability into asset prices and returns.3\n\nFinally, I believe that when real interest rates are low, we should expect to see more mergers. Mergers typically involve enduring current costs in exchange for a flow of future benefits. For example, to initiate the merger, the acquiring firm has to search for an appropriate target, and that search can be costly. As well, after the merger, it may be necessary to undertake a one-time costly reorganization of people and materiel to achieve the anticipated gains in revenue. Businesses will be more willing to pay the upfront costs of a merger in exchange for the anticipated flow of future benefits associated with the merger if the real interest rate is low.4\n\nIn this way, unusually low real interest rates should be expected to be linked with inflated asset prices, high asset return volatility and heightened merger activity. All of these financial market outcomes are often interpreted as signifying financial market instability. And this observation brings me to a key conclusion. I’ve suggested that it is likely that, for a number of years to come, the FOMC will only achieve its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability if its actions are able to keep real interest rates unusually low. I’ve also argued that when real interest rates are low, we are likely to see financial market outcomes that signify instability. It follows that, for a considerable period of time, the FOMC may only be able to achieve its macroeconomic objectives in association with signs of instability in financial markets.\n\nThese financial market phenomena could pose macroeconomic risks. In my view, such potentialities are best addressed through effective supervision and regulation of the financial sector. It is possible, though, that these tools may only partially mitigate the relevant macroeconomic risks. How, if at all, should the FOMC adapt monetary policy in response to any residual risk?\n\nIn remarks that I gave earlier this year, I described an analytical mean-variance framework that the Committee could use to answer this question.5 Today, I’ll simply sketch the elements of that framework. Basically, the FOMC will need to confront an ongoing probabilistic cost-benefit calculation. On the one hand, raising the real interest rate will definitely lead to lower employment and prices. On the other hand, raising the real interest rate may reduce the risk of a financial crisis—a crisis that could give rise to a much larger fall in employment and prices. Thus, the Committee has to weigh the certainty of a costly deviation from its dual mandate objectives against the benefit of reducing the probability of an even larger deviation from those objectives.\n\nIn my view, this cost-benefit assessment is relatively clear right now. As I mentioned earlier, employment and prices are expected to be quite low over the medium term. In these circumstances, the cost of tightening policy has to be seen as great. At the same time, the Survey of Professional Forecasters reveals that forecasters see little chance of a large downward movement in employment and prices. These forecasts suggest that there would be little gain, in terms of forestalling adverse macroeconomic outcomes, from monetary policy tightening.\n\nHowever, I expect this assessment to become more difficult for monetary policymakers in the future. Eventually, the outlook for employment and prices will improve to be broadly consistent with the FOMC’s objectives. As I’ve described, I expect that the real interest rate will still be unusually low at that juncture. In these circumstances, I anticipate that financial stability considerations are likely to play a substantial role in the determination of the appropriate level of monetary accommodation.\n\nI should stress that the Committee is in a better position to carry out this kind of probabilistic cost-benefit analysis in 2014 than it was in 2007. The Federal Reserve System now dedicates a significant amount of our best staff resources to financial system surveillance. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis contributes to these efforts in a number of ways, including our ongoing monitoring of the risk-neutral probability distributions of future asset values.6 As a result of these efforts, the FOMC has a lot more information, on an ongoing basis, about the extent of financial system risks.\n\nNonetheless, as always, there is more to be learned. We need to understand better, in light of the current state of supervision and regulation, which residual financial system risks have the potential to translate into macroeconomic risks. And we need to understand better to what extent monetary policy tightening can in fact temper those residual financial system risks.\n\nLet me wrap up.\n\nOver the past seven years, there have been big changes in the demand for and supply of safe assets. These changes seem likely to be persistent, and they mean that the FOMC may need to keep real interest rates unusually low for years if it is to achieve its objectives of maximum employment and price stability. I see this conclusion as broadly consistent with the last sentence of the FOMC’s April statement.\n\nIt follows that, to attain maximum employment and price stability over the same long period of time, Americans will likely face the consequences of low real interest rates. I’ve emphasized consequences related to financial market instability, like inflated asset prices, volatile asset returns and heightened merger activity. Even in the presence of effective supervision and regulation, these phenomena could pose residual macroeconomic risks. The FOMC’s decision about whether to respond to those residual risks using the rather blunt tool of monetary policy will necessarily depend on a delicate probabilistic cost-benefit calculation.\n\nThanks for listening.

            "content": "Note*\nThanks for the introduction, and thank you for the invitation to join you here today. It’s a pleasure to be back at the Economic Club of Minnesota.\nI’ll begin my speech with some basics about the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). But the bulk of my remarks should be viewed as a quarterly report of sorts. Your elected representatives, the Congress of the United States, have charged the Federal Reserve with achieving key macroeconomic goals. My speech will be a report to you, the Economic Club of Minnesota, about how the FOMC is doing in terms of achieving those goals. Please keep in mind, though, that I will be expressing my own views, and they are not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nI look forward to responding to, and learning from, your questions at the conclusion of my remarks.\nFederal Reserve System Basics\nLet me begin with some basics about the Federal Reserve System. I like to tell people that the Fed is a uniquely American institution. What do I mean by that? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve Banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our Bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts and includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\nEight times per year, the FOMC meets to set the path of interest rates over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve Banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. However, the Committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a rotating group of four other presidents. I’m one of those four presidents this year. In this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government, because representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations.\nAt those eight meetings, the FOMC decides on the level of monetary stimulus for the economy. I won’t get into too many details of what that term “monetary stimulus” means, although I’m more than happy to take questions about it later. For now, I’ll just make three high-level points. First, when the FOMC changes the level of stimulus, our actions tend to push inflation—that is, the rate of growth of prices—and employment in the same direction. Raising the level of stimulus puts upward pressure on both inflation and employment. Lowering the level of stimulus puts downward pressure on both inflation and employment. Second, the FOMC’s actions only affect inflation and employment with a lag, usually thought to be about one-and-a-half to two years. Finally, over the long run, monetary policy is the prime determinant of the overall rate of inflation in the economy, but many factors beyond monetary policy affect the long-run level of employment.\nWhat is the FOMC seeking to achieve by varying the level of monetary stimulus? Congress has charged the FOMC with making monetary policy to promote price stability and to promote maximum employment. The FOMC has interpreted the first goal, price stability, to mean keeping inflation close to 2 percent. The FOMC’s job is to vary monetary stimulus over time to meet these mandated objectives.\nThe remainder of my speech will take the form of a report to you about how the FOMC is doing in terms of meeting these goals set for us by your elected representatives in Congress.\nPrice Stability\nI will start with price stability. Again, operationally, the FOMC has translated this into keeping the rate of increase of the price level—that is, the inflation rate—close to 2 percent. Even more specifically, the FOMC uses what’s called the personal consumption expenditure price index, or PCE, to calculate inflation. This measure of inflation captures the rate of increase in all goods and services, including those related to food and energy.\nThe Great Recession is dated as starting in December 2007. Here’s a graph of how PCE inflation has behaved since that date.\nLarge chart\nThe main take-away is that, since that date, the PCE inflation rate has averaged 1.5 percent per year.\nIn some sense, going back to 2007 is a little misleading, because the FOMC did not adopt its 2 percent inflation target until January 2012. However, since that decision, PCE inflation has continued to drift downward. Currently, the PCE inflation rate is running slightly above 1 percent.\nSo, whether we look over the past six years or over the past two years, inflation has been running too low to be consistent with price stability. The good news is that the FOMC does expect inflation to turn back toward 2 percent. However, I expect that return to 2 percent to take a long time—possibly on the order of four years. And I’m not the only one forecasting a slow return to 2 percent inflation. Earlier this year, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) predicted that inflation will not reach 2 percent until 2018.\nTo sum up: The FOMC is undershooting its price stability goal.\nLow Inflation: Why It Matters\nI’ve told you that inflation has been, is and will be too low relative to the FOMC’s target of 2 percent. But why should you care that inflation is too low? Isn’t it a good thing when goods and services aren’t as expensive to buy? There are two answers to this—very good—question.\nThe first answer is that borrowers and lenders in our economy count on the Federal Reserve to deliver the inflation rate it targeted. If inflation is higher than the target, lenders are harmed because they receive payments that are smaller than they expected in real terms. Put another way, they can buy fewer goods and services with their payments than they expected. If inflation is lower than the target, borrowers are harmed because they must make payments that are larger than they expected in real terms. Why is that? When inflation is below target, goods and services are indeed cheaper, but wages also tend to be lower. Depressed wages mean that a family’s mortgage payment consumes a larger fraction of the family’s income than they expected when they took out the loan. That unexpectedly high mortgage payment harms the family, and it’s a harm that the FOMC can prevent by achieving the inflation rate that it targeted.\nThe second answer is: You should care about below-target inflation because it signals a significant problem in our economy.\nLet me explain what I mean. At a basic level, you should think of prices as a signal about how our economy is using its available resources. In 2012, I had an experience that brought home this intuition in a very clear way. I visited Williston, on the western edge of North Dakota. As it is today, when I visited Williston, it was in the heart of a major oil boom. That boom was pushing hard on the physical resources—like roads, water, housing—available to Williston and pushing hard on the human resources available to Williston. The result was relatively high inflation.\nSo, when inflation is high compared to the Fed’s target, like it was in Williston, we know that demand is pushing hard on available resources. The converse is also true: Inflation is low compared to the Fed’s target when the demand for goods and services is too low to fully use the available resources in society. The low inflation in the United States tells us that resources are being wasted.\nWhat exactly are these wasted resources? There are multiple answers to this question—when demand is too low, lots of resources are left unused. But the biggest and most disturbing answer is our fellow Americans. There are many productive people in the United States available to work more hours, and our society is deprived of their production.\nThis key point is generally underappreciated. I’ve said that the FOMC is undershooting its price stability objective and is expected to continue to do so. But we should all keep in mind that this outcome—and especially the forecast for continued undershooting—typically means that the FOMC is also underperforming on its other objective of promoting maximum employment.\nShould the FOMC Make Up for Past Inflation Misses?\nI’ve described how I expect that the PCE inflation rate will run below the FOMC’s 2 percent target for several years—possibly until 2018. Let’s assume that forecast turns out to be right. This outcome raises a key policy question: How should the FOMC’s inflation goals in the years following 2018 be influenced by the undershooting of the inflation target in the preceding years?\nIn addressing this question, I’ll compare two possible approaches: the standard approach of inflation targeting and the more novel approach of price level targeting. Let me note before I begin that I won’t take a stand today on which of those approaches is better. My goal is simply to initiate a policy conversation about future—indeed, possibly far-off future—monetary policy choices.\nThe FOMC announced its 2 percent inflation target in January 2012. Since that date, inflation has averaged about 1.3 percent per year. Like the CBO, I anticipate that inflation will rise only slowly, returning to the FOMC’s target in about 2018.\nLarge chart\nAs you know, the inflation rate is the growth rate of the price level—that is, how much people pay for a typical bundle of goods and services. Hence, the downside misses with respect to inflation cumulate into a significantly lower price level. If my inflation forecast is right, the price level in 2018 will be about 2.5 percent below what it would have been had the FOMC hit its inflation target over the preceding six years.\nLarge chart\nHow should the FOMC respond to this shortfall in the price level? If the FOMC simply targets a 2 percent inflation rate after 2018, then the price level will be permanently 2.5 percent lower than was expected in 2012. This approach to policy—which is the standard one followed by most leading central banks around the world—is called inflation targeting. But there is an alternative: The FOMC could target a slightly higher inflation rate for a few years after 2018 in order to make up for the shortfall in the price level. This latter policy approach is often termed price level targeting.\nWhy would the FOMC want to use price level targeting? There are two reasons—and they are closely related to the concerns about low inflation that I raised earlier.\nThe first reason is that price level targeting makes long-term contracts safer for borrowers and lenders. For example, suppose a family took out a 30-year mortgage in 2012, under the expectation that the FOMC would deliver on its commitment to keep inflation at 2 percent. Because inflation has been so low over the past two years, the borrower’s current repayments are now surprisingly expensive in real terms. (By “real terms,” I mean that the borrower has to give up a surprising amount of goods and services to be able to afford the repayments.) The FOMC can’t solve that problem today, of course. But if the FOMC uses inflation targeting, the borrower’s repayments are likely to remain surprisingly expensive in real terms even in 2042, 30 years after taking out the mortgage. In contrast, if the FOMC uses price level targeting, the borrower’s repayments in 2042 are likely to be close, in real terms, to what the borrower expected when originally taking on the loan.\nThe second reason that the FOMC might want to use price level targeting is that it would serve as an automatic stabilizer for the economy. As I described earlier, when demand is low, inflation tends to be below target. With price level targeting, the FOMC makes up for low inflation by using monetary policy to stimulate higher future inflation and higher future demand. But this prospect of higher future demand is an incentive for businesses to hire and invest more now. Thus, with price level targeting, the FOMC’s anticipated future policy choices automatically offset current adverse shocks.1\nI’ve framed the decision about inflation targeting versus price level targeting in terms of its impact on the FOMC’s future policy decisions. As I’ve just talked through, though, these future decisions have the potential to affect near-term macroeconomic outcomes. In particular, if the FOMC were to decide today to follow price level targeting, then businesses would anticipate more stimulative future monetary policy and, consequently, higher future demand. That expectation of higher demand would provide an additional incentive for them to hire and invest today. In this way, the FOMC’s decision about price level targeting—a decision about choices to be made several years from now—has the potential to affect the near-term speed of the economy’s recovery.\nI suspect that all of this sounds pretty dry to some of you. I assure you that the debate over price level versus inflation targeting is about as exciting as central banking can get! I’m certainly not trying to resolve that debate today. In particular, I’ve not talked at all about the thorny and important question of how the FOMC should respond to past overshooting of its inflation target. But I do think that the question of whether to target the inflation rate or the price level should be a subject for serious discussion among central bankers.\nMaximum Employment\nI’ve argued that the low inflation rate is a signal that the FOMC is underperforming with respect to its maximum employment objective. But we don’t need to rely on this signal to reach this conclusion. We can readily see this underperformance in numerous key metrics of labor market performance.\nI’ll begin by showing you data on the evolution of the unemployment rate. In March 2007, the unemployment rate was 4.4 percent. It rose slowly throughout 2007 to reach 5 percent by the end of the year. The National Bureau of Economic Research dates the Great Recession as having begun in that month. In the wake of the recession, the unemployment rate reached a peak of 10 percent in October 2009.\nSince that date—over four years ago!—the unemployment rate has fallen slowly to 6.3 percent. This is still unusually high relative to the past quarter century or so. The current unemployment rate is also high relative to most forecasts of its expected long-run level. Personally, I expect that, over the long run, the unemployment rate will converge to just over 5 percent. Basically, an unemployment rate of 6.3 percent means that the U.S. labor market is not healthy.\nBut I would say that this measure—troubling as it is—could well overstate the degree of improvement in the U.S. labor market. To estimate the unemployment rate, the Census Bureau asks people two questions: Are you working? And, if not, have you looked for work in the past four weeks? The unemployment rate measures the ratio of the second number—the recent job searchers—to the sum of the two numbers (the recent job searchers and the workers). This means that the unemployment rate can decline for two reasons: because more people are finding work or because fewer people are looking for work. Most of the declines in the unemployment rate since October 2009 have occurred because the fraction of people who are looking for work has fallen. This characterization is borne out if we look at the evolution of the fraction of people over the age of 16 who have a job—what’s called the employment-to-population ratio.\nLarge chart\nIn March 2007, the employment-to-population ratio was over 63 percent. The employment-to-population ratio fell sharply during the Great Recession and bottomed out at just over 58 percent in mid-2011. The percentage has risen little from this low point and remains lower than at any time between 1986 and 2007.\nIt is true that, even without the Great Recession, demographic forces would have led to some decline in the employment-to-population ratio since 2007. As the baby boom birth cohort—born between 1946 and 1964—ages, the fraction of retirees in the population grows steadily. But these demographic forces are still not large enough to account for most of the decline in the employment-to-population ratio that I’ve described. One way to see this—but not the only way—is to focus on people who are outside the normal retirement age. Here, I’ve plotted the fraction of the population aged 25 to 54 who have a job. This ratio has improved from its low point, but also remains lower than at any time between 1986 and 2007.\nLarge chart\nEven among those who have a job, there are signs that the economy is significantly underemploying our human resources. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports each month on the number of Americans who are working part time, would like to work more hours, but are unable to obtain those additional hours. That fraction of the labor force has fallen, but remains unusually high.\nLarge chart\nTo summarize what we learn from the charts: The good news is that the labor market has improved since the end of the Great Recession. The bad news is that the rate of improvement over the past four-plus years has been painfully slow. As a consequence, there is still significant underutilization of our country’s most important resource—its people. We have to conclude that the FOMC is underperforming with respect to its goal of promoting maximum employment.\nConclusions\nEarlier, I asked you to consider this speech as a report to you on the FOMC’s performance with respect to its two congressionally mandated objectives. We’ve seen that the FOMC is undershooting its price stability objective, in that inflation is running well below the FOMC’s goal of 2 percent and is expected to remain that low for several years. The undershooting is problematic because it suggests that the American economy is wasting available resources, especially its human resources. We’ve seen strong evidence of this underutilization in the performance of key labor market metrics. Hence, the FOMC is also underperforming with respect to its maximum employment objective. I continue to believe that we need to do better as a Committee.\nThank you for listening. I’d be happy to take your questions.\nNote\n* Thanks to Manuel Amador, David Fettig, Terry Fitzgerald and Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for their assistance with these remarks and the supporting materials.\nEndnote\n1 See, for example, Gauti Eggertsson and Michael Woodford, 2003, “The Zero Bound on Interest Rates and Optimal Monetary Policy,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity.\n\nNote*\n\nThanks for the introduction, and thank you for the invitation to join you here today. It’s a pleasure to be back at the Economic Club of Minnesota.\n\nI’ll begin my speech with some basics about the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). But the bulk of my remarks should be viewed as a quarterly report of sorts. Your elected representatives, the Congress of the United States, have charged the Federal Reserve with achieving key macroeconomic goals. My speech will be a report to you, the Economic Club of Minnesota, about how the FOMC is doing in terms of achieving those goals. Please keep in mind, though, that I will be expressing my own views, and they are not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI look forward to responding to, and learning from, your questions at the conclusion of my remarks.\n\nLet me begin with some basics about the Federal Reserve System. I like to tell people that the Fed is a uniquely American institution. What do I mean by that? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve Banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our Bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts and includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\n\nEight times per year, the FOMC meets to set the path of interest rates over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve Banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. However, the Committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a rotating group of four other presidents. I’m one of those four presidents this year. In this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government, because representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations.\n\nAt those eight meetings, the FOMC decides on the level of monetary stimulus for the economy. I won’t get into too many details of what that term “monetary stimulus” means, although I’m more than happy to take questions about it later. For now, I’ll just make three high-level points. First, when the FOMC changes the level of stimulus, our actions tend to push inflation—that is, the rate of growth of prices—and employment in the same direction. Raising the level of stimulus puts upward pressure on both inflation and employment. Lowering the level of stimulus puts downward pressure on both inflation and employment. Second, the FOMC’s actions only affect inflation and employment with a lag, usually thought to be about one-and-a-half to two years. Finally, over the long run, monetary policy is the prime determinant of the overall rate of inflation in the economy, but many factors beyond monetary policy affect the long-run level of employment.\n\nWhat is the FOMC seeking to achieve by varying the level of monetary stimulus? Congress has charged the FOMC with making monetary policy to promote price stability and to promote maximum employment. The FOMC has interpreted the first goal, price stability, to mean keeping inflation close to 2 percent. The FOMC’s job is to vary monetary stimulus over time to meet these mandated objectives.\n\nThe remainder of my speech will take the form of a report to you about how the FOMC is doing in terms of meeting these goals set for us by your elected representatives in Congress.\n\nI will start with price stability. Again, operationally, the FOMC has translated this into keeping the rate of increase of the price level—that is, the inflation rate—close to 2 percent. Even more specifically, the FOMC uses what’s called the personal consumption expenditure price index, or PCE, to calculate inflation. This measure of inflation captures the rate of increase in all goods and services, including those related to food and energy.\n\nThe Great Recession is dated as starting in December 2007. Here’s a graph of how PCE inflation has behaved since that date.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nThe main take-away is that, since that date, the PCE inflation rate has averaged 1.5 percent per year.\n\nIn some sense, going back to 2007 is a little misleading, because the FOMC did not adopt its 2 percent inflation target until January 2012. However, since that decision, PCE inflation has continued to drift downward. Currently, the PCE inflation rate is running slightly above 1 percent.\n\nSo, whether we look over the past six years or over the past two years, inflation has been running too low to be consistent with price stability. The good news is that the FOMC does expect inflation to turn back toward 2 percent. However, I expect that return to 2 percent to take a long time—possibly on the order of four years. And I’m not the only one forecasting a slow return to 2 percent inflation. Earlier this year, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) predicted that inflation will not reach 2 percent until 2018.\n\nTo sum up: The FOMC is undershooting its price stability goal.\n\nI’ve told you that inflation has been, is and will be too low relative to the FOMC’s target of 2 percent. But why should you care that inflation is too low? Isn’t it a good thing when goods and services aren’t as expensive to buy? There are two answers to this—very good—question.\n\nThe first answer is that borrowers and lenders in our economy count on the Federal Reserve to deliver the inflation rate it targeted. If inflation is higher than the target, lenders are harmed because they receive payments that are smaller than they expected in real terms. Put another way, they can buy fewer goods and services with their payments than they expected. If inflation is lower than the target, borrowers are harmed because they must make payments that are larger than they expected in real terms. Why is that? When inflation is below target, goods and services are indeed cheaper, but wages also tend to be lower. Depressed wages mean that a family’s mortgage payment consumes a larger fraction of the family’s income than they expected when they took out the loan. That unexpectedly high mortgage payment harms the family, and it’s a harm that the FOMC can prevent by achieving the inflation rate that it targeted.\n\nThe second answer is: You should care about below-target inflation because it signals a significant problem in our economy.\n\nLet me explain what I mean. At a basic level, you should think of prices as a signal about how our economy is using its available resources. In 2012, I had an experience that brought home this intuition in a very clear way. I visited Williston, on the western edge of North Dakota. As it is today, when I visited Williston, it was in the heart of a major oil boom. That boom was pushing hard on the physical resources—like roads, water, housing—available to Williston and pushing hard on the human resources available to Williston. The result was relatively high inflation.\n\nSo, when inflation is high compared to the Fed’s target, like it was in Williston, we know that demand is pushing hard on available resources. The converse is also true: Inflation is low compared to the Fed’s target when the demand for goods and services is too low to fully use the available resources in society. The low inflation in the United States tells us that resources are being wasted.\n\nWhat exactly are these wasted resources? There are multiple answers to this question—when demand is too low, lots of resources are left unused. But the biggest and most disturbing answer is our fellow Americans. There are many productive people in the United States available to work more hours, and our society is deprived of their production.\n\nThis key point is generally underappreciated. I’ve said that the FOMC is undershooting its price stability objective and is expected to continue to do so. But we should all keep in mind that this outcome—and especially the forecast for continued undershooting—typically means that the FOMC is also underperforming on its other objective of promoting maximum employment.\n\nI’ve described how I expect that the PCE inflation rate will run below the FOMC’s 2 percent target for several years—possibly until 2018. Let’s assume that forecast turns out to be right. This outcome raises a key policy question: How should the FOMC’s inflation goals in the years following 2018 be influenced by the undershooting of the inflation target in the preceding years?\n\nIn addressing this question, I’ll compare two possible approaches: the standard approach of inflation targeting and the more novel approach of price level targeting. Let me note before I begin that I won’t take a stand today on which of those approaches is better. My goal is simply to initiate a policy conversation about future—indeed, possibly far-off future—monetary policy choices.\n\nThe FOMC announced its 2 percent inflation target in January 2012. Since that date, inflation has averaged about 1.3 percent per year. Like the CBO, I anticipate that inflation will rise only slowly, returning to the FOMC’s target in about 2018.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nAs you know, the inflation rate is the growth rate of the price level—that is, how much people pay for a typical bundle of goods and services. Hence, the downside misses with respect to inflation cumulate into a significantly lower price level. If my inflation forecast is right, the price level in 2018 will be about 2.5 percent below what it would have been had the FOMC hit its inflation target over the preceding six years.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nHow should the FOMC respond to this shortfall in the price level? If the FOMC simply targets a 2 percent inflation rate after 2018, then the price level will be permanently 2.5 percent lower than was expected in 2012. This approach to policy—which is the standard one followed by most leading central banks around the world—is called inflation targeting. But there is an alternative: The FOMC could target a slightly higher inflation rate for a few years after 2018 in order to make up for the shortfall in the price level. This latter policy approach is often termed price level targeting.\n\nWhy would the FOMC want to use price level targeting? There are two reasons—and they are closely related to the concerns about low inflation that I raised earlier.\n\nThe first reason is that price level targeting makes long-term contracts safer for borrowers and lenders. For example, suppose a family took out a 30-year mortgage in 2012, under the expectation that the FOMC would deliver on its commitment to keep inflation at 2 percent. Because inflation has been so low over the past two years, the borrower’s current repayments are now surprisingly expensive in real terms. (By “real terms,” I mean that the borrower has to give up a surprising amount of goods and services to be able to afford the repayments.) The FOMC can’t solve that problem today, of course. But if the FOMC uses inflation targeting, the borrower’s repayments are likely to remain surprisingly expensive in real terms even in 2042, 30 years after taking out the mortgage. In contrast, if the FOMC uses price level targeting, the borrower’s repayments in 2042 are likely to be close, in real terms, to what the borrower expected when originally taking on the loan.\n\nThe second reason that the FOMC might want to use price level targeting is that it would serve as an automatic stabilizer for the economy. As I described earlier, when demand is low, inflation tends to be below target. With price level targeting, the FOMC makes up for low inflation by using monetary policy to stimulate higher future inflation and higher future demand. But this prospect of higher future demand is an incentive for businesses to hire and invest more now. Thus, with price level targeting, the FOMC’s anticipated future policy choices automatically offset current adverse shocks.1\n\nI’ve framed the decision about inflation targeting versus price level targeting in terms of its impact on the FOMC’s future policy decisions. As I’ve just talked through, though, these future decisions have the potential to affect near-term macroeconomic outcomes. In particular, if the FOMC were to decide today to follow price level targeting, then businesses would anticipate more stimulative future monetary policy and, consequently, higher future demand. That expectation of higher demand would provide an additional incentive for them to hire and invest today. In this way, the FOMC’s decision about price level targeting—a decision about choices to be made several years from now—has the potential to affect the near-term speed of the economy’s recovery.\n\nI suspect that all of this sounds pretty dry to some of you. I assure you that the debate over price level versus inflation targeting is about as exciting as central banking can get! I’m certainly not trying to resolve that debate today. In particular, I’ve not talked at all about the thorny and important question of how the FOMC should respond to past overshooting of its inflation target. But I do think that the question of whether to target the inflation rate or the price level should be a subject for serious discussion among central bankers.\n\nI’ve argued that the low inflation rate is a signal that the FOMC is underperforming with respect to its maximum employment objective. But we don’t need to rely on this signal to reach this conclusion. We can readily see this underperformance in numerous key metrics of labor market performance.\n\nI’ll begin by showing you data on the evolution of the unemployment rate. In March 2007, the unemployment rate was 4.4 percent. It rose slowly throughout 2007 to reach 5 percent by the end of the year. The National Bureau of Economic Research dates the Great Recession as having begun in that month. In the wake of the recession, the unemployment rate reached a peak of 10 percent in October 2009.\n\nSince that date—over four years ago!—the unemployment rate has fallen slowly to 6.3 percent. This is still unusually high relative to the past quarter century or so. The current unemployment rate is also high relative to most forecasts of its expected long-run level. Personally, I expect that, over the long run, the unemployment rate will converge to just over 5 percent. Basically, an unemployment rate of 6.3 percent means that the U.S. labor market is not healthy.\n\nBut I would say that this measure—troubling as it is—could well overstate the degree of improvement in the U.S. labor market. To estimate the unemployment rate, the Census Bureau asks people two questions: Are you working? And, if not, have you looked for work in the past four weeks? The unemployment rate measures the ratio of the second number—the recent job searchers—to the sum of the two numbers (the recent job searchers and the workers). This means that the unemployment rate can decline for two reasons: because more people are finding work or because fewer people are looking for work. Most of the declines in the unemployment rate since October 2009 have occurred because the fraction of people who are looking for work has fallen. This characterization is borne out if we look at the evolution of the fraction of people over the age of 16 who have a job—what’s called the employment-to-population ratio.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nIn March 2007, the employment-to-population ratio was over 63 percent. The employment-to-population ratio fell sharply during the Great Recession and bottomed out at just over 58 percent in mid-2011. The percentage has risen little from this low point and remains lower than at any time between 1986 and 2007.\n\nIt is true that, even without the Great Recession, demographic forces would have led to some decline in the employment-to-population ratio since 2007. As the baby boom birth cohort—born between 1946 and 1964—ages, the fraction of retirees in the population grows steadily. But these demographic forces are still not large enough to account for most of the decline in the employment-to-population ratio that I’ve described. One way to see this—but not the only way—is to focus on people who are outside the normal retirement age. Here, I’ve plotted the fraction of the population aged 25 to 54 who have a job. This ratio has improved from its low point, but also remains lower than at any time between 1986 and 2007.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nEven among those who have a job, there are signs that the economy is significantly underemploying our human resources. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports each month on the number of Americans who are working part time, would like to work more hours, but are unable to obtain those additional hours. That fraction of the labor force has fallen, but remains unusually high.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nTo summarize what we learn from the charts: The good news is that the labor market has improved since the end of the Great Recession. The bad news is that the rate of improvement over the past four-plus years has been painfully slow. As a consequence, there is still significant underutilization of our country’s most important resource—its people. We have to conclude that the FOMC is underperforming with respect to its goal of promoting maximum employment.\n\nEarlier, I asked you to consider this speech as a report to you on the FOMC’s performance with respect to its two congressionally mandated objectives. We’ve seen that the FOMC is undershooting its price stability objective, in that inflation is running well below the FOMC’s goal of 2 percent and is expected to remain that low for several years. The undershooting is problematic because it suggests that the American economy is wasting available resources, especially its human resources.

I am honored to participate in this prestigious event.\nMy talk tonight will consist of some reflections on diversity. I’ll first talk about the regional diversity that lies at the heart of the Federal Reserve System. I’ll talk next about my journey to my current position and the role that international diversity played in that journey. Finally, I’ll close with some thoughts on the role of workplace diversity.\nMy remarks represent my own views, which are not necessarily those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Federal Reserve System: A Regionally Diverse Central Bank\nI’ll begin by telling you a few things about my organization, the Federal Reserve System. I will be highlighting the role of regional diversity in the Federal Reserve’s formulation of economic policy.\nRelative to other central banks around the world, the Federal Reserve System is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve Banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts and includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\nThis basic structure has a long history. In fact, this year is the centennial of the opening of the 12 Reserve Banks and the start of the work undertaken by the Federal Reserve System. It’s been a fascinating hundred years, with many twists and turns along the way. I’m sure that many of you have questions about that journey. The answers to all of your questions—and probably more—are on a new website that the Fed has created at federalreservehistory.org. I encourage you to visit this site to learn more about the people, places and events that have shaped Federal Reserve history.\nOver the course of its long history, the Federal Reserve System has performed many economic functions. In my view, its regional diversity improves its effectiveness with respect to virtually all of those functions. However, tonight I’ll focus on one of the most important: monetary policy. Eight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to set the path of interest rates over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the governors of the Federal Reserve Board participate in these meetings.\nHow does its regional structure help the Federal Reserve System make better monetary policy? The answer lies in the nature of the regional Bank presidents’ contributions during FOMC meetings. During the course of the meetings, the presidents typically comment on the behavior of their district economies—in my case, the economies of the six states that make up the Ninth District. This region-specific information helps to provide a granular, more forward-looking foundation for the making of national monetary policy.\nWhere do the presidents get this region-specific information? There are many answers to this question. But we are especially indebted to the members of our boards of directors and advisory councils, who use their extensive contacts in the local community to provide us with valuable economic intelligence. The Reserve Banks know that our district economies are all complex systems, and so we need “intel” from a wide range of perspectives. Accordingly, the Reserve Banks work hard to ensure that the members of our boards and advisory councils come from many walks of life—farming, banking, Fortune 500 companies, nonprofits, labor unions and start-ups to name but a few—and many parts of our districts.\nSo, the 12 presidents contribute to monetary policy deliberations by providing local economic intelligence about their districts. But the presidents also often make comments about economic research being done within their Banks that helps shed light on national economic conditions. Hence, the geographic diversity within the System is important for another reason: It generates valuable intellectual diversity across the System. For example, back in the 1970s, the Minneapolis Fed Research department played a key role in fostering the “rational expectations revolution” that has helped transform the making of monetary policy around the world. I’d love to take a few hours to explain this important development in policymaking—but it’s a Friday night. The relevant point is this: Would these economists have played this same role had they been working in Washington, or anywhere else in the System, for that matter? I believe that the answer to this question is no. The ideas in the Research department were generated by synergistic interactions between Minneapolis Fed economists and University of Minnesota economists—synergies that owed a lot to the geographical proximity between the two institutions.\nTo sum up: My organization, the Federal Reserve System, is grounded in a decentralized regional structure. This decentralized regional structure ensures that national policymakers have access to information about local economies—information that is often more forward-looking than lagged aggregate data. But, just as importantly, the regional structure also promotes intellectual diversity in the way policymakers think about the economy.\nMy Diverse Beginnings\nI’ll now turn to a different set of reflections on diversity—reflections about my journey to my current position.\nI was born in Baltimore, Maryland, but my parents moved me to Canada when I was less than a year old. I suspect that they did not consult extensively with me first! For most of my childhood, I grew up in Winnipeg, which is about 300 miles northwest of here as the crow flies, before returning to the United States to attend college. I’ve lived in my home country ever since.\nBoth of my parents spent most of their professional careers as professors of statistics at the University of Manitoba. Given their example, it is probably not surprising that I ended up becoming a professor myself—albeit in economics, rather than statistics. After getting my doctorate, I worked in a number of economics departments around the country, including the University of Minnesota for most of the 2000s. Along the way, I was a researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis in the mid-1990s. I maintained a close working relationship with the Research department following that stint.\nIn early 2009, it was announced that Gary Stern, the long-time president of the Bank, would be retiring soon. Many of you will remember that, in early 2009, we were in the depths of the Great Recession. I was highly motivated to serve my country as best I could in this hour of need, and so I applied for the job. I was fortunate enough to win the approval of the Minneapolis Fed’s board of directors and the Board of Governors in Washington, and so I became president in October 2009. The job has, to put it mildly, been a highly rewarding one.\nThis description—with its emphasis on my training and experience—captures much of what matters about my journey to my current position. Nonetheless, I also feel that it glosses over something important. That missing piece can be summed up in a question that I often get: Why do you have such an unusual name?\nThe answer to this question is that my father was Asian Indian—and was, more specifically, from the state of Andhra Pradesh. (I add that specificity because it matters: My last name is very much identified with that particular state—a state that has roughly one-fourth the population of the United States.) My father immigrated to the United States in 1960 to attend graduate school in statistics, which is where he met my mother. My mother is of European descent. She grew up in a suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and her parents were both born in the United States. My parents got married when they were in grad school, and so I was able to attend my father’s Ph.D. graduation ceremony. I probably didn’t appreciate the event as much as I should have. In my defense, I was only nine months old.\nMy parents’ household was—automatically—a diverse household. It was diverse in terms of food—something that mattered a lot to me as a child. It was diverse in terms of our family and friends. Perhaps most importantly, it was diverse in terms of ideas. As a child, I read the lives and words of American heroes like Abraham Lincoln. But I also read the lives and words of Indian heroes like Mohandas Gandhi. In this way, I learned at a young age that two different cultures can give us at least two different ways to think about a problem. I learned too that both of those different ways can provide valuable insights, even if they seem to be in conflict. Perhaps as a consequence, I tend to follow many tracks—almost at once—in my thinking about problems. I have found this multipronged approach to problems helpful in many facets of my life. But it does have the potential to create communication challenges!\nI can sum up the overall impact of my beginnings in this way. When I was a child, and especially when I was a teen, my parents seemed, well, old-fashioned. I suspect that I was not the first nor the last child or teen to feel that way! But, looking back, I realize that, in many ways, my upbringing in the 1960s and 1970s was surprisingly well-designed for the 21st century that was to come. In particular, our internationally diverse household was ideal preparation for our increasingly diverse country and interconnected world.\nSome Final Reflections on Workplace Diversity\nI’ve talked about two kinds of diversity. The first kind is the regional and economic diversity that lies at the heart of the Federal Reserve System. The second kind is the international diversity that lay at the heart of my parents’ household. But you will observe that I implicitly argued that both kinds of diversity are valuable in large part because they are associated with a diversity of ideas.\nThat brings me to some final thoughts about diversity and, more specifically, diversity in the workplace. Many organizations, including my own, emphasize that they aim to attract and retain a diverse workforce. Of course, as we just discussed, the word diversity has many meanings. But certainly, when we talk about a “diverse” workforce, we typically mean to include gender and ethnic diversity. In the case of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, part of the mission of our Office of Minority and Women Inclusion is to promote exactly that kind of diversity within our workforce.\nThe emphasis on this aim in public communications is mostly beneficial. But it can have an unfortunate side effect. Some observers could be led to think that diversity is an ultimate objective of the organization, and so there is an implicit trade-off between achieving a diversity objective and achieving the other goals of the organization. I don’t see any such trade-off. Rather, I believe that an organization like the Minneapolis Fed will be less effective at achieving its core missions unless it is able to attract and retain a diverse workplace. I’ll put this as an economist: I do not see diversity as an objective unto itself. Rather, like the electricity that powers our building or the computers that fill our offices, diversity is simply a fundamental input to our being able to achieve our goals.\nWhy won’t we be effective without a diverse workplace? There are many answers to this question. But, again, I think one of the main answers is about ideas. Ultimately, a person’s ideas are a culmination of his or her journey through life. We will have access to more and better ideas if our employees have a large number of distinct life journeys. And we need those more and better ideas if we are to be effective in solving the various public policy challenges that we confront.\nThanks for listening.\nNote\n* Thanks to Dorothy Bridges, Duane Carter and David Fettig for their assistance with these remarks.\n\nNote*\n\nI would like to thank state Senator Alice Johnson and Executive Director Sia Her for the invitation to attend the 2014 Asian Heritage Dinner.

Accordingly, the Reserve Banks work hard to ensure that the members of our boards and advisory councils come from many walks of life—farming, banking, Fortune 500 companies, nonprofits, labor unions and start-ups to name but a few—and many parts of our districts.\n\nSo, the 12 presidents contribute to monetary policy deliberations by providing local economic intelligence about their districts. But the presidents also often make comments about economic research being done within their Banks that helps shed light on national economic conditions. Hence, the geographic diversity within the System is important for another reason: It generates valuable intellectual diversity across the System. For example, back in the 1970s, the Minneapolis Fed Research department played a key role in fostering the “rational expectations revolution” that has helped transform the making of monetary policy around the world. I’d love to take a few hours to explain this important development in policymaking—but it’s a Friday night. The relevant point is this: Would these economists have played this same role had they been working in Washington, or anywhere else in the System, for that matter? I believe that the answer to this question is no. The ideas in the Research department were generated by synergistic interactions between Minneapolis Fed economists and University of Minnesota economists—synergies that owed a lot to the geographical proximity between the two institutions.\n\nTo sum up: My organization, the Federal Reserve System, is grounded in a decentralized regional structure. This decentralized regional structure ensures that national policymakers have access to information about local economies—information that is often more forward-looking than lagged aggregate data. But, just as importantly, the regional structure also promotes intellectual diversity in the way policymakers think about the economy.\n\nI’ll now turn to a different set of reflections on diversity—reflections about my journey to my current position.\n\nI was born in Baltimore, Maryland, but my parents moved me to Canada when I was less than a year old. I suspect that they did not consult extensively with me first! For most of my childhood, I grew up in Winnipeg, which is about 300 miles northwest of here as the crow flies, before returning to the United States to attend college. I’ve lived in my home country ever since.\n\nBoth of my parents spent most of their professional careers as professors of statistics at the University of Manitoba. Given their example, it is probably not surprising that I ended up becoming a professor myself—albeit in economics, rather than statistics. After getting my doctorate, I worked in a number of economics departments around the country, including the University of Minnesota for most of the 2000s. Along the way, I was a researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis in the mid-1990s. I maintained a close working relationship with the Research department following that stint.\n\nIn early 2009, it was announced that Gary Stern, the long-time president of the Bank, would be retiring soon. Many of you will remember that, in early 2009, we were in the depths of the Great Recession. I was highly motivated to serve my country as best I could in this hour of need, and so I applied for the job. I was fortunate enough to win the approval of the Minneapolis Fed’s board of directors and the Board of Governors in Washington, and so I became president in October 2009. The job has, to put it mildly, been a highly rewarding one.\n\nThis description—with its emphasis on my training and experience—captures much of what matters about my journey to my current position. Nonetheless, I also feel that it glosses over something important. That missing piece can be summed up in a question that I often get: Why do you have such an unusual name?\n\nThe answer to this question is that my father was Asian Indian—and was, more specifically, from the state of Andhra Pradesh. (I add that specificity because it matters: My last name is very much identified with that particular state—a state that has roughly one-fourth the population of the United States.) My father immigrated to the United States in 1960 to attend graduate school in statistics, which is where he met my mother. My mother is of European descent. She grew up in a suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and her parents were both born in the United States. My parents got married when they were in grad school, and so I was able to attend my father’s Ph.D. graduation ceremony. I probably didn’t appreciate the event as much as I should have. In my defense, I was only nine months old.\n\nMy parents’ household was—automatically—a diverse household. It was diverse in terms of food—something that mattered a lot to me as a child. It was diverse in terms of our family and friends. Perhaps most importantly, it was diverse in terms of ideas. As a child, I read the lives and words of American heroes like Abraham Lincoln. But I also read the lives and words of Indian heroes like Mohandas Gandhi. In this way, I learned at a young age that two different cultures can give us at least two different ways to think about a problem. I learned too that both of those different ways can provide valuable insights, even if they seem to be in conflict. Perhaps as a consequence, I tend to follow many tracks—almost at once—in my thinking about problems. I have found this multipronged approach to problems helpful in many facets of my life. But it does have the potential to create communication challenges!\n\nI can sum up the overall impact of my beginnings in this way. When I was a child, and especially when I was a teen, my parents seemed, well, old-fashioned. I suspect that I was not the first nor the last child or teen to feel that way! But, looking back, I realize that, in many ways, my upbringing in the 1960s and 1970s was surprisingly well-designed for the 21st century that was to come. In particular, our internationally diverse household was ideal preparation for our increasingly diverse country and interconnected world.\n\nI’ve talked about two kinds of diversity. The first kind is the regional and economic diversity that lies at the heart of the Federal Reserve System. The second kind is the international diversity that lay at the heart of my parents’ household. But you will observe that I implicitly argued that both kinds of diversity are valuable in large part because they are associated with a diversity of ideas.\n\nThat brings me to some final thoughts about diversity and, more specifically, diversity in the workplace. Many organizations, including my own, emphasize that they aim to attract and retain a diverse workforce. Of course, as we just discussed, the word diversity has many meanings. But certainly, when we talk about a “diverse” workforce, we typically mean to include gender and ethnic diversity. In the case of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, part of the mission of our Office of Minority and Women Inclusion is to promote exactly that kind of diversity within our workforce.\n\nThe emphasis on this aim in public communications is mostly beneficial. But it can have an unfortunate side effect. Some observers could be led to think that diversity is an ultimate objective of the organization, and so there is an implicit trade-off between achieving a diversity objective and achieving the other goals of the organization. I don’t see any such trade-off. Rather, I believe that an organization like the Minneapolis Fed will be less effective at achieving its core missions unless it is able to attract and retain a diverse workplace. I’ll put this as an economist: I do not see diversity as an objective unto itself. Rather, like the electricity that powers our building or the computers that fill our offices, diversity is simply a fundamental input to our being able to achieve our goals.\n\nWhy won’t we be effective without a diverse workplace? There are many answers to this question. But, again, I think one of the main answers is about ideas. Ultimately, a person’s ideas are a culmination of his or her journey through life. We will have access to more and better ideas if our employees have a large number of distinct life journeys. And we need those more and better ideas if we are to be effective in solving the various public policy challenges that we confront.\n\nThanks for listening."

But the plan is for us to spend the bulk of our evening on your questions. One key point before I start: The views I express today are my own and are not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System, including my colleagues on the FOMC.\nIn terms of basics about the Fed: I like to tell people that the Fed is a uniquely American institution. What do I mean by that? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve Banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our Bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts and includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\nEight times per year, the FOMC meets to set the path of interest rates over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve Banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. However, the Committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a rotating group of four other presidents. I’m one of those four presidents this year. In this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government, because representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations.\nThis basic federalist structure has a long history. In fact, this year is the centennial of the opening of the 12 Reserve Banks and the start of the work undertaken by the Federal Reserve System. It’s been a fascinating hundred years, with many twists and turns along the way. I’m sure that many of you have questions about that journey. The answers to all of your questions—and probably more—are on a new website that the Fed has created at federalreservehistory.org. I encourage you to visit this site to learn more about the people, places and events that have shaped Federal Reserve history.\nI won’t say too much more about Fed history—perhaps to the relief of some of you!—but I do want to address one of the things that I think has changed the most over the Federal Reserve’s history: our communication with the public. A hundred years ago, Congress created a system that was designed specifically so that the residents of Main Street would have a voice in monetary policy. Technology has changed a lot since 1914—I’m told that they didn’t even have smartphones back then—and so the ways that we gather information from Main Street have changed. But this fact-finding is still an important part of the making of monetary policy. Indeed, earlier today, I met with Fargo business leaders to gather exactly this kind of information.\nCommunication is a two-way street, however. During the past century, the Federal Reserve’s communications to the public about its monetary policy actions have also evolved greatly. The pace of change was especially rapid in the past eight years under Chairman Bernanke’s leadership. During that time, the Federal Reserve specified an explicit target for inflation, began holding regular press conferences and greatly expanded its use of forward guidance—that is, its communications about the likely future evolution of policy. So, as the Federal Reserve System plans for its second century, I would say that the importance of two-way communication is a key lesson from the System’s first century. In order for the Fed to continue to be effective, it needs to communicate its policy decisions transparently to the public. Conversely, it also needs the public’s input into how those policies are affecting them. Events like the one today, and my meeting with business leaders earlier today, are a key part of fostering that two-way communication.\nWith that background in mind, let me turn back to the Federal Open Market Committee and the making of monetary policy. I mentioned that the FOMC meets eight times per year. At those meetings, we decide on the level of monetary stimulus for the economy. I won’t get into too many details of what that term “monetary stimulus” means, although I’m sure that I’ll be taking questions about it later.\nWhat is the FOMC seeking to achieve by varying the level of monetary stimulus? Congress has charged the FOMC with making monetary policy to promote price stability and to promote maximum employment. The FOMC has interpreted the first goal, price stability, to mean keeping inflation close to 2 percent.\nThe FOMC’s job is to vary monetary stimulus over time to meet these mandated objectives. Right now, personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation is running well below 2 percent and is expected to continue to do so for several years. By many measures, employment remains low and is expected to remain so for several years. Those results are not as good as they should be—we’re undershooting on inflation and underperforming on employment. I look forward to working with my colleagues to use our monetary policy tools to achieve better macroeconomic outcomes.\nThanks again, and now let’s move on to your questions.\nNote\n* Thanks to David Fettig, Terry Fitzgerald and Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for their assistance with these remarks.\n\nNote*\n\nThanks for the introduction, Howard, and thank you for the invitation to join you here today.

            "content": "Introduction\nRobert Hall’s paper is a well-written and remarkably wide-ranging examination of the evolution of the U.S. economy over the past few years.1 I learned a tremendous amount from reading it—and I’m sure that I would learn even more upon rereading it. It should be read by anyone—policymaker or academic—who is interested in deepening and broadening his or her understanding of the current U.S. macroeconomic situation.\nI found the paper’s focus on the behavior of the capital stock and total factor productivity (TFP) to be especially informative. Hall emphasizes that a large fraction of the decline in output (relative to trend) over the past seven years is attributable to slow growth in the capital stock and TFP. This point is valuable given how much the public policy conversation focuses on the behavior of aggregate employment.\nHall’s ultimate goal is to reach conclusions about the likely future course of the U.S. macroeconomy and about the likely impact of particular kinds of policy choices on that projected evolution. The conclusions are well-summarized in Table 10 of the paper. My discussion uses Table 10 as a jumping-off point and proceeds in two distinct directions. The first direction is empirical. I discuss the behavior of U.S. macroeconomic data in the mid-20th century. My main theme is that, in these data, seemingly permanent changes in the macroeconomy did reverse and that these reversals occurred over surprisingly short time periods.\nThe second direction is theoretical. I argue that typical modeling of aggregate resource constraints implies that, regardless of the current state, it is possible for employment and output to rise remarkably rapidly over short time frames. This perspective implies that we should think about the future course of the American economy as being determined by the choices of private citizens and policymakers, and not as a matter of statistical inevitability. We can divide the relevant choice problem into two distinct questions about the future course of the economy. The first is a collective one for American society: Given the projected path for macroeconomic aggregates like consumption, output, and employment, are there alternative (but resource-feasible) paths that would be preferred? The second is a technical one for economists: Given a desired path, what policy choices (specifically, taxes and subsidies) would give rise to that desired path?\nThe answer to this second technical question is typically model-dependent. However, I suggest that a long-favored prescription of public finance economists—to lower the tax rate on physical investment—would give rise to higher output, consumption, capital, and employment in a wide range of models. This potential approach seems especially relevant given Hall’s focus on the decline in capital over the past five or six years.2\nMid-20th Century Evidence\nThe first part of my discussion centers on the evolution of macroeconomic data during and after the Great Depression. The Great Depression started in the United States in 1929. By 1933, key macroeconomic aggregates like TFP, real output, employment, and capital had declined sharply relative to their historical trends. The unemployment rate had soared from under 5 percent to over 20 percent. I examine the recovery of each of these variables in turn.\nI’ll begin with total factor productivity. Cole and Ohanian (1999) document that, by 1933, TFP was about 15 percent below trend.3 It might well seem intuitive that such a profound decline would be challenging to reverse. But during the Depression, TFP grew so rapidly that it had recovered to its pre-Depression trend within three years after bottoming out in 1933.4\nThere was also a dramatic turnaround in real output, employment, and unemployment, but this turnaround was much more delayed. Ten years after the start of the Great Depression, real output remained about 25 percent below trend, employment was about 18 percent below trend, and the unemployment rate remained above 15 percent. It would have been natural to conclude that such persistent changes would prove to be permanent. Of course, such was not the case. Real gross domestic product (GDP) almost doubled from 1939 to 1944.5 The unemployment rate fell by 13 percentage points in three years, falling from nearly 15 percent in 1940 to under 2 percent by 1943.6 Employment rose by 50 percent from 1939 to 1943.7 Importantly, these reversals proved to be enduring: As of 1950, all three variables were close to what one might have expected as of 1929.8\nFinally, let me turn to the capital stock. Hall suggests that the decline in the size of the capital stock, relative to trend, over the past few years will be challenging to reverse. The mid-20th century data are consistent with this perspective. Even as late as 1950, fixed assets in the United States remained around 20 percent below trend.9\nTo sum up, in the early years of the Great Depression, there were sharp declines relative to trend in several key aggregate variables. However, for most of these variables, the declines were reversed over short periods of time. Strikingly, for real GDP, employment, and unemployment, these reversals occurred after they had persisted for over a decade. Consistent with Hall’s emphasis, though, the capital stock was a notable exception to this pattern of recovery. It remained well below trend over 20 years after the Great Depression.\nA Theoretical Perspective\nIt is typical to dismiss the mid-20th century recoveries in real GDP, employment, and unemployment because of the obvious connection of those recoveries to World War II. But this dismissal seems overly glib to me for three reasons. First, in principle, the U.S. economy could have engaged in the same increased production, without the results of that increased production ever being used in the act of war. Second, the recoveries persisted well after the end of the war (and indeed proved to be essentially permanent). The final reason is theoretical: The usual modeling of aggregate resource constraints implies that rapid increases in aggregate inputs and outputs are in fact physically possible. I will spend the rest of my discussion on this last perspective and its implications.\nThe typical macroeconomic model is based on an aggregate production function that is unbounded from above and increasing with respect to labor and capital. Hence, given this function, it is possible for output to increase rapidly as long as the labor input increases sufficiently. In a similar vein, aggregate models of physical capital accumulation typically assume that the future capital stock is an unbounded and increasing function of physical investment. According to this formulation, it is possible for the capital stock to rise rapidly, as long as physical investment increases sufficiently.\nThus, the typical aggregate models imply that it is physically possible for future U.S. economic activity to be distinctly higher than what might be expected to unfold. This implication means that these models give rise to the following key policy question: Is the United States willing to pay the costs required to generate that materially higher path for economic activity? It is important to be clear about the meaning of the term “costs.” As a society, we can only increase labor input by forgoing leisure and home production. And as a society, we can only increase investment by increasing labor input or by reducing consumption. Hence, I see the following as the key policy question: Is the United States, as a society, willing to forgo the leisure, home production, and/or near-term consumption required to generate materially higher future economic activity?\nI don’t see this question as one that I can answer using my tools as an economist. Rather, I see it as a social choice problem that can only be resolved through a collective decision by Americans. But let me stipulate, for the purposes of this discussion, that Americans are collectively willing to give up leisure and consumption so as to generate a higher path for future economic activity. What policy choices should be made so as to ensure that higher path actually materializes?\nThis second, technical, question can be answered—at least in the abstract—through the tools of public finance. Consider some feasible allocation. What prevents that feasible allocation from emerging as an equilibrium outcome? The answer is that the marginal societal trade-offs implied by that desired allocation may not align with the marginal private incentives that arise in equilibrium.10 But this problem can be fixed by choosing a system of taxes and subsidies that fills in the gaps between marginal societal and private trade-offs. Given that system, the desired allocation then emerges as an equilibrium outcome.11\nAs I say, in the abstract, this is all well-understood in public finance. In macroeconomics, this basic approach has been used to great effect by a number of authors since the pioneering work of Lucas and Stokey (1983).\nOf course, the problem with this abstract approach is that it is hardly model-free. Different models imply different marginal private incentives, and those give rise in turn to different implications for appropriate taxes and subsidies. Given the current economic situation, I would—overly crudely—divide the empirically relevant models into two classes: demand-constrained and supply-constrained. The demand-constrained models imply that the key private incentives have to do with the willingness of households and firms to spend given the current real interest rate. The supply-constrained models imply that the key private incentives have to do with the willingness of businesses to expand production given their assessments of costs (including taxes and regulation). The two kinds of models can have very different implications for appropriate taxes and subsidies. For example, the supply-constrained models typically imply that employment will rise if there is a temporary cut in the payroll tax rate paid by employers. Eggertsson (2011) shows that this implication is, in fact, reversed in demand-constrained models.\nFortunately, there is (at least) one kind of tax reduction that will work to stimulate future economic activity in both demand-constrained models and supply-constrained models. Suppose that the government were to reduce the tax rate on physical investment. Eggertsson (2011) shows that, in a demand-constrained model, such a policy change would stimulate investment demand and so generate higher economic activity. But this policy change is also effective in supply-constrained models. In those models, it leads to a higher rate of capital accumulation, which stimulates future economic activity by lowering the future costs of production.12\nI should be precise about what I mean by the phrase “reducing the tax rate on physical investment.” I don’t mean “reducing the tax rate on the income from financial wealth.” In a demand-constrained model, that would deter spending by households and firms and lead to worse outcomes. Nor am I referring to reducing the tax rate on dividend income, capital gains, or corporate profits. Such reductions may have effects other than reducing the tax rate on physical investment. Rather, I’m referring specifically to reducing the tax rate on the process of transforming current goods into future goods. In practice, the government can accomplish such a reduction in a relatively targeted fashion by allowing businesses to completely expense any investments into equipment, structures, or R&D.\nWrap-Up\nLet me conclude.\nThe main theme of my discussion is that the future course of the U.S. economy is not predetermined by the events of the past seven years. Both history and theory have the same lesson: It is possible to undo what might now appear to be permanent changes. The question is not whether such reversals are possible. The question is whether they are, in fact, socially desirable in light of the associated losses in terms of consumption and/or home production. In general, different models have different implications for what kinds of policies will stimulate current and future economic activity. However, reducing the tax rate on physical investment is an effective form of stimulus in a wide class of models.\nEndnotes\n1 I thank Richard Condor, Terry Fitzgerald, Fabrizio Perri, and Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for their comments. The views expressed in this discussion are my own, and are not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n2 Just to be clear: I’m not suggesting that the declines in economic activity described by Hall are attributable to increased tax rates.\n3 Ohanian (2001) argues that little of this change can be explained by reductions in factor utilization or by compositional effects.\n4 See Cole and Ohanian (1999). See also Field (2011).\n5 See the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) National Economic Accounts. Data are from the “Current-dollar and ‘real’ GDP” spreadsheet.\n6 See Lebergott (1957).\n7 As measured by BEA full-time employment equivalents. See “Table 6.5A. Full-Time Equivalent Employees by Industry” in Section 6 of the National Income and Product Accounts.\n8 In terms of employment, this statement is based on 1948 data (the BEA’s series on full-time equivalents has a change in its estimation procedure starting in 1949).\n9 BEA plus 3 percent trend line starting in 1929. See “Table 1.2. Chain-Type Quantity Indexes for Net Stock of Fixed Assets and Consumer Durable Goods” in Section 1 of the Fixed Assets Accounts Tables in the BEA National Data. Data are from line 2, “Fixed Assets.”\n10 I’m abstracting from the kinds of informational restrictions on tax systems that are explored in some detail in Kocherlakota (2010). For plausible models of individual heterogeneity, these informational restrictions impose few limits on the set of aggregate outcomes that are achievable by a society. However, these informational restrictions do impose limits on social insurance and redistribution, and so may well affect societal preferences over aggregate outcomes.\n11 I’m assuming that the government has access to affine taxes, so that potential budget imbalances can be solved through an appropriate choice of an intercept for the tax system (as in Werning 2007). I’m also ignoring the potentially important issue of implementation (to guarantee that there is no other undesirable equilibrium allocation).\n12 Also see Fernández-Villaverde, Guerrón-Quintana, and Rubio-Ramírez (2012) for a discussion of future supply-side reforms that can serve as a current demand-side stimulus.\nReferences\nCole, Harold L., and Lee E.

It should be read by anyone—policymaker or academic—who is interested in deepening and broadening his or her understanding of the current U.S. macroeconomic situation.\n\nI found the paper’s focus on the behavior of the capital stock and total factor productivity (TFP) to be especially informative. Hall emphasizes that a large fraction of the decline in output (relative to trend) over the past seven years is attributable to slow growth in the capital stock and TFP. This point is valuable given how much the public policy conversation focuses on the behavior of aggregate employment.\n\nHall’s ultimate goal is to reach conclusions about the likely future course of the U.S. macroeconomy and about the likely impact of particular kinds of policy choices on that projected evolution. The conclusions are well-summarized in Table 10 of the paper. My discussion uses Table 10 as a jumping-off point and proceeds in two distinct directions. The first direction is empirical. I discuss the behavior of U.S. macroeconomic data in the mid-20th century. My main theme is that, in these data, seemingly permanent changes in the macroeconomy did reverse and that these reversals occurred over surprisingly short time periods.\n\nThe second direction is theoretical. I argue that typical modeling of aggregate resource constraints implies that, regardless of the current state, it is possible for employment and output to rise remarkably rapidly over short time frames. This perspective implies that we should think about the future course of the American economy as being determined by the choices of private citizens and policymakers, and not as a matter of statistical inevitability. We can divide the relevant choice problem into two distinct questions about the future course of the economy. The first is a collective one for American society: Given the projected path for macroeconomic aggregates like consumption, output, and employment, are there alternative (but resource-feasible) paths that would be preferred? The second is a technical one for economists: Given a desired path, what policy choices (specifically, taxes and subsidies) would give rise to that desired path?\n\nThe answer to this second technical question is typically model-dependent. However, I suggest that a long-favored prescription of public finance economists—to lower the tax rate on physical investment—would give rise to higher output, consumption, capital, and employment in a wide range of models. This potential approach seems especially relevant given Hall’s focus on the decline in capital over the past five or six years.2\n\nThe first part of my discussion centers on the evolution of macroeconomic data during and after the Great Depression. The Great Depression started in the United States in 1929. By 1933, key macroeconomic aggregates like TFP, real output, employment, and capital had declined sharply relative to their historical trends. The unemployment rate had soared from under 5 percent to over 20 percent. I examine the recovery of each of these variables in turn.\n\nI’ll begin with total factor productivity. Cole and Ohanian (1999) document that, by 1933, TFP was about 15 percent below trend.3 It might well seem intuitive that such a profound decline would be challenging to reverse. But during the Depression, TFP grew so rapidly that it had recovered to its pre-Depression trend within three years after bottoming out in 1933.4\n\nThere was also a dramatic turnaround in real output, employment, and unemployment, but this turnaround was much more delayed. Ten years after the start of the Great Depression, real output remained about 25 percent below trend, employment was about 18 percent below trend, and the unemployment rate remained above 15 percent. It would have been natural to conclude that such persistent changes would prove to be permanent. Of course, such was not the case. Real gross domestic product (GDP) almost doubled from 1939 to 1944.5 The unemployment rate fell by 13 percentage points in three years, falling from nearly 15 percent in 1940 to under 2 percent by 1943.6 Employment rose by 50 percent from 1939 to 1943.7 Importantly, these reversals proved to be enduring: As of 1950, all three variables were close to what one might have expected as of 1929.8\n\nFinally, let me turn to the capital stock. Hall suggests that the decline in the size of the capital stock, relative to trend, over the past few years will be challenging to reverse. The mid-20th century data are consistent with this perspective. Even as late as 1950, fixed assets in the United States remained around 20 percent below trend.9\n\nTo sum up, in the early years of the Great Depression, there were sharp declines relative to trend in several key aggregate variables. However, for most of these variables, the declines were reversed over short periods of time. Strikingly, for real GDP, employment, and unemployment, these reversals occurred after they had persisted for over a decade. Consistent with Hall’s emphasis, though, the capital stock was a notable exception to this pattern of recovery. It remained well below trend over 20 years after the Great Depression.\n\nIt is typical to dismiss the mid-20th century recoveries in real GDP, employment, and unemployment because of the obvious connection of those recoveries to World War II. But this dismissal seems overly glib to me for three reasons. First, in principle, the U.S. economy could have engaged in the same increased production, without the results of that increased production ever being used in the act of war. Second, the recoveries persisted well after the end of the war (and indeed proved to be essentially permanent). The final reason is theoretical: The usual modeling of aggregate resource constraints implies that rapid increases in aggregate inputs and outputs are in fact physically possible. I will spend the rest of my discussion on this last perspective and its implications.\n\nThe typical macroeconomic model is based on an aggregate production function that is unbounded from above and increasing with respect to labor and capital. Hence, given this function, it is possible for output to increase rapidly as long as the labor input increases sufficiently. In a similar vein, aggregate models of physical capital accumulation typically assume that the future capital stock is an unbounded and increasing function of physical investment. According to this formulation, it is possible for the capital stock to rise rapidly, as long as physical investment increases sufficiently.\n\nThus, the typical aggregate models imply that it is physically possible for future U.S. economic activity to be distinctly higher than what might be expected to unfold. This implication means that these models give rise to the following key policy question: Is the United States willing to pay the costs required to generate that materially higher path for economic activity? It is important to be clear about the meaning of the term “costs.” As a society, we can only increase labor input by forgoing leisure and home production. And as a society, we can only increase investment by increasing labor input or by reducing consumption. Hence, I see the following as the key policy question: Is the United States, as a society, willing to forgo the leisure, home production, and/or near-term consumption required to generate materially higher future economic activity?\n\nI don’t see this question as one that I can answer using my tools as an economist. Rather, I see it as a social choice problem that can only be resolved through a collective decision by Americans. But let me stipulate, for the purposes of this discussion, that Americans are collectively willing to give up leisure and consumption so as to generate a higher path for future economic activity. What policy choices should be made so as to ensure that higher path actually materializes?\n\nThis second, technical, question can be answered—at least in the abstract—through the tools of public finance. Consider some feasible allocation. What prevents that feasible allocation from emerging as an equilibrium outcome? The answer is that the marginal societal trade-offs implied by that desired allocation may not align with the marginal private incentives that arise in equilibrium.10 But this problem can be fixed by choosing a system of taxes and subsidies that fills in the gaps between marginal societal and private trade-offs. Given that system, the desired allocation then emerges as an equilibrium outcome.11\n\nAs I say, in the abstract, this is all well-understood in public finance. In macroeconomics, this basic approach has been used to great effect by a number of authors since the pioneering work of Lucas and Stokey (1983).\n\nOf course, the problem with this abstract approach is that it is hardly model-free. Different models imply different marginal private incentives, and those give rise in turn to different implications for appropriate taxes and subsidies. Given the current economic situation, I would—overly crudely—divide the empirically relevant models into two classes: demand-constrained and supply-constrained. The demand-constrained models imply that the key private incentives have to do with the willingness of households and firms to spend given the current real interest rate. The supply-constrained models imply that the key private incentives have to do with the willingness of businesses to expand production given their assessments of costs (including taxes and regulation). The two kinds of models can have very different implications for appropriate taxes and subsidies. For example, the supply-constrained models typically imply that employment will rise if there is a temporary cut in the payroll tax rate paid by employers. Eggertsson (2011) shows that this implication is, in fact, reversed in demand-constrained models.\n\nFortunately, there is (at least) one kind of tax reduction that will work to stimulate future economic activity in both demand-constrained models and supply-constrained models. Suppose that the government were to reduce the tax rate on physical investment. Eggertsson (2011) shows that, in a demand-constrained model, such a policy change would stimulate investment demand and so generate higher economic activity. But this policy change is also effective in supply-constrained models. In those models, it leads to a higher rate of capital accumulation, which stimulates future economic activity by lowering the future costs of production.12\n\nI should be precise about what I mean by the phrase “reducing the tax rate on physical investment.” I don’t mean “reducing the tax rate on the income from financial wealth.” In a demand-constrained model, that would deter spending by households and firms and lead to worse outcomes. Nor am I referring to reducing the tax rate on dividend income, capital gains, or corporate profits. Such reductions may have effects other than reducing the tax rate on physical investment. Rather, I’m referring specifically to reducing the tax rate on the process of transforming current goods into future goods. In practice, the government can accomplish such a reduction in a relatively targeted fashion by allowing businesses to completely expense any investments into equipment, structures, or R&D.\n\nLet me conclude.\n\nThe main theme of my discussion is that the future course of the U.S. economy is not predetermined by the events of the past seven years. Both history and theory have the same lesson: It is possible to undo what might now appear to be permanent changes. The question is not whether such reversals are possible. The question is whether they are, in fact, socially desirable in light of the associated losses in terms of consumption and/or home production. In general, different models have different implications for what kinds of policies will stimulate current and future economic activity. However, reducing the tax rate on physical investment is an effective form of stimulus in a wide class of models.\n\nCole, Harold L., and Lee E.

It’s a pleasure to be back in Rochester.\nI’ll begin my speech with some basics about the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC). But the bulk of my remarks should be viewed as a quarterly report of sorts. Your elected representatives, the Congress of the United States, have charged the Federal Reserve with achieving key macroeconomic goals. My speech will be a report to you, the people of Rochester, about how the FOMC is doing in terms of achieving those goals. Please keep in mind, though, that I will be expressing my own views, and they are not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nI look forward to responding to, and learning from, your questions at the conclusion of my remarks.\nFederal Reserve System Basics\nLet me begin with some basics about the Federal Reserve System. I like to tell people that the Fed is a uniquely American institution. What do I mean by that? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve Banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our Bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts and includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\nEight times per year, the FOMC meets to set the path of interest rates over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve Banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. However, the Committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a rotating group of four other presidents. I’m one of those four presidents this year. In this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government, because representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations.\nThis basic federalist structure has a long history. In fact, this year is the centennial of the opening of the 12 Reserve Banks and the start of the work undertaken by the Federal Reserve System. It’s been a fascinating hundred years, with many twists and turns along the way. I’m sure that many of you have questions about that journey—for example, how the heck did Minneapolis get chosen over Rochester as headquarters for the Ninth District? The answers to all of your questions—and probably more—are on a new website that the Fed has created. I encourage you to visit this site to learn more about the people, places and events that have shaped Federal Reserve history.\nI won’t say too much more about Fed history—perhaps to the relief of some of you!—but I do want to address one of the things that I think has changed the most over the Federal Reserve’s history: our communication with the public. A hundred years ago, Congress created a system that was designed specifically so that the residents of Main Street would have a voice in monetary policy. Technology has changed a lot since 1914—I’m told that they didn’t even have smartphones back then—and so the ways that we gather information from Main Street have changed. But this fact-finding is still an important part of the making of monetary policy. Indeed, earlier today, I met with southern Minnesota business leaders to gather exactly this kind of information.\nCommunication is a two-way street, however. During the past century, the Federal Reserve’s communications to the public about its monetary policy actions have also evolved greatly. The pace of change was especially rapid in the past eight years under Chairman Bernanke’s leadership. During that time, the Federal Reserve specified an explicit target for inflation, began holding regular press conferences and greatly expanded its use of forward guidance—that is, its communications about the likely future evolution of policy. So, as the Federal Reserve System plans for its second century, I would say that the importance of two-way communication is a key lesson from the System’s first century. In order for the Fed to continue to be effective, it needs to communicate its policy decisions transparently to the public. Conversely, it also needs the public’s input on how those policies are affecting them. Events like the one today, and my meeting with business leaders earlier today, are a key part of fostering that two-way communication.\nWith that background in mind, let me turn back to the FOMC and the making of monetary policy. I mentioned that the FOMC meets eight times per year. At those meetings, we decide on the level of monetary stimulus for the economy. I won’t get into too many details of what that term “monetary stimulus” means, although I’m more than happy to take questions about it later. For now, I’ll just make three high-level points. First, when the FOMC changes the level of stimulus, our actions tend to push inflation—that is, the rate of growth of prices—and employment in the same direction. Raising the level of stimulus puts upward pressure on both inflation and employment. Lowering the level of stimulus puts downward pressure on both inflation and employment. Second, the FOMC’s actions only affect inflation and employment with a lag, usually thought to be about one and a half to two years. Finally, over the long run, monetary policy is the prime determinant of the overall rate of inflation in the economy, but many factors beyond monetary policy affect the level of employment.\nWhat is the FOMC seeking to achieve by varying the level of monetary stimulus? Congress has charged the FOMC with making monetary policy to promote price stability and to promote maximum employment. The FOMC has interpreted the first goal, price stability, to mean keeping inflation close to 2 percent. The FOMC’s job is to vary monetary stimulus over time to meet these mandated objectives.\nThe remainder of my speech will take the form of a report to you about how the FOMC is doing in terms of meeting these goals set for us by your elected representatives in Congress.\nPrice Stability\nI will start with price stability. Again, operationally, the FOMC has translated this into keeping the rate of increase of the price level—that is, the inflation rate—close to 2 percent. Even more specifically, the FOMC uses what’s called the personal consumption expenditure price index, or PCE, to calculate inflation. This measure of inflation captures the rate of increase in all goods and services, including those related to food and energy.\nThe Great Recession is dated as starting in December 2007. Here’s a graph of how PCE inflation has behaved since that date.\nLarge chart\nThe main take-away is that, since that date, the PCE inflation rate has averaged 1.5 percent per year. Furthermore, there has been a downward drift since early 2012. Currently, the PCE inflation rate is running near 1 percent.\nSo, inflation has been running too low over the past six-plus years to be consistent with price stability. The good news is that the FOMC does expect inflation to turn back toward 2 percent. However, I expect that return to 2 percent to take a long time—probably on the order of four years. And I’m not the only one forecasting a slow return to 2 percent inflation. Earlier this year, the Congressional Budget Office predicted that inflation will not reach 2 percent until 2019.\nTo sum up: The FOMC is undershooting its price stability goal.\nLow Inflation: Why It Matters\nI’ve told you that inflation has been, is and will be too low relative to the FOMC’s target of 2 percent. But why should you care that inflation is too low? Isn’t it a good thing when goods and services aren’t as expensive to buy? The answer to this—very good—question is: You should care because below-target inflation signals a significant problem in our economy.\nLet me explain what I mean. At a basic level, you should think of prices as a signal about how our economy is using its available resources. In 2012, I had an experience that brought home this intuition in a very clear way. I visited Williston, on the western edge of North Dakota. As it is today, when I visited Williston, it was in the heart of a major oil boom. That boom was pushing hard on the physical resources—like roads, water, housing—available to Williston and pushing hard on the human resources available to Williston. The result was relatively high inflation.\nSo, when inflation is high compared to the Fed’s target, like it was in Williston, we know that demand is pushing hard on available resources. The converse is also true: Inflation is low compared to the Fed’s target when the demand for goods and services is too low to fully use the available resources in society. The low inflation in the United States tells us that resources are being wasted.\nWhat exactly are these wasted resources? There are multiple answers to this question—when demand is too low, lots of resources are left unused. But the biggest and most disturbing answer is our fellow Americans. There are many productive people in the United States available to work more hours, and our society is deprived of their production.\nThis key point is generally underappreciated. I’ve said that the FOMC is undershooting its price stability objective and is expected to continue to do so. But we should all keep in mind that this outcome—and especially the forecast for continued undershooting—typically means that the FOMC is also underperforming on its other objective of promoting maximum employment.\nMaximum Employment\nI’ve argued that the low inflation rate is a signal that the FOMC is underperforming with respect to its maximum employment objective. But we don’t need to rely on this signal to reach this conclusion. We can readily see this underperformance in numerous key metrics of labor market performance.\nI’ll begin by showing you data on the evolution of the unemployment rate. In March 2007, the unemployment rate was 4.4 percent. It rose slowly throughout 2007 to reach 5 percent by the end of the year. The National Bureau of Economic Research dates the Great Recession as having begun in that month. In the wake of the recession, the unemployment rate reached a peak of 10 percent in October 2009.\nSince that date—over four years ago!—the unemployment rate has fallen slowly to 6.7 percent. This is still unusually high relative to the past quarter century or so. The current unemployment rate is also high relative to most forecasts of its expected long-run level. Personally, I expect that, over the long run, the unemployment rate will converge to just over 5 percent. Basically, an unemployment rate of 6.7 percent means that the U.S. labor market is far from healthy.\nBut I would say that this measure—troubling as it is—could well overstate the degree of improvement in the U.S. labor market. To estimate the unemployment rate, the Census Bureau asks people two questions: Are you working? And, if not, have you looked for work in the past four weeks? The unemployment rate measures the ratio of the second number—the recent job searchers—to the sum of the two numbers (the recent job searchers and the workers). This means that the unemployment rate can decline for two reasons: because more people are finding work or because fewer people are looking for work. Most of the declines in the unemployment rate since October 2009 have occurred because the fraction of people who are looking for work has fallen. This characterization is borne out if we look at the evolution of the fraction of people over the age of 16 who have a job—what’s called the employment-to-population ratio.\nLarge chart\nIn March 2007, the employment-to-population ratio was over 63 percent. The employment-to-population ratio fell sharply during the Great Recession and bottomed out at just over 58 percent in mid-2011. The percentage has risen little from this low point and remains lower than at any time between 1986 and 2007.\nIt is true that, even without the Great Recession, demographic forces would have led to some decline in the employment-to-population ratio since 2007. As the baby boom birth cohort—born between 1946 and 1964—ages, the fraction of retirees in the population grows steadily. But these demographic forces are still not large enough to account for most of the decline in the employment-to-population ratio that I’ve described. One way to see this—but not the only way—is to focus on people who are outside the normal retirement age. Here, I’ve plotted the fraction of the population aged 25 to 54 who have a job. This ratio has improved from its low point, but also remains lower than at any time between 1986 and 2007.\nLarge chart\nEven among those who have a job, there are signs that the economy is significantly underemploying our human resources. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports each month on the number of Americans who are working part time, would like to work more hours, but are unable to obtain those additional hours. That fraction of the labor force has fallen, but remains unusually high.\nLarge chart\nTo summarize what we learn from the charts: The good news is that the labor market has improved since the end of the Great Recession. The bad news is that the rate of improvement over the past four-plus years has been painfully slow. As a consequence, there is still significant underutilization of our country’s most important resource—its people. We have to conclude that the FOMC is underperforming with respect to its goal of promoting maximum employment.\nConclusions\nEarlier, I asked you to consider this speech as a report to you, the people of Rochester, on the FOMC’s performance with respect to its two congressionally mandated objectives. We’ve seen that the FOMC is undershooting its price stability objective, in that inflation is running well below the FOMC’s goal of 2 percent and is expected to remain that low for several years. The undershooting is problematic because it suggests that the American economy is wasting available resources, especially its human resources. We’ve seen strong evidence of this underutilization in the performance of key labor market metrics. Hence, the FOMC is also underperforming with respect to its maximum employment objective. We need to do better as a Committee—and I look forward to working with my colleagues to make that happen.\nThank you for listening. I’d be happy to take your questions.\nNote\n* Thanks to David Fettig, Terry Fitzgerald and Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for their assistance with these remarks and the supporting materials.\n\nNote*\n\nThanks for the introduction, and thank you for the invitation to join you here today.

Finally, over the long run, monetary policy is the prime determinant of the overall rate of inflation in the economy, but many factors beyond monetary policy affect the level of employment.\n\nWhat is the FOMC seeking to achieve by varying the level of monetary stimulus? Congress has charged the FOMC with making monetary policy to promote price stability and to promote maximum employment. The FOMC has interpreted the first goal, price stability, to mean keeping inflation close to 2 percent. The FOMC’s job is to vary monetary stimulus over time to meet these mandated objectives.\n\nThe remainder of my speech will take the form of a report to you about how the FOMC is doing in terms of meeting these goals set for us by your elected representatives in Congress.\n\nI will start with price stability. Again, operationally, the FOMC has translated this into keeping the rate of increase of the price level—that is, the inflation rate—close to 2 percent. Even more specifically, the FOMC uses what’s called the personal consumption expenditure price index, or PCE, to calculate inflation. This measure of inflation captures the rate of increase in all goods and services, including those related to food and energy.\n\nThe Great Recession is dated as starting in December 2007. Here’s a graph of how PCE inflation has behaved since that date.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nThe main take-away is that, since that date, the PCE inflation rate has averaged 1.5 percent per year. Furthermore, there has been a downward drift since early 2012. Currently, the PCE inflation rate is running near 1 percent.\n\nSo, inflation has been running too low over the past six-plus years to be consistent with price stability. The good news is that the FOMC does expect inflation to turn back toward 2 percent. However, I expect that return to 2 percent to take a long time—probably on the order of four years. And I’m not the only one forecasting a slow return to 2 percent inflation. Earlier this year, the Congressional Budget Office predicted that inflation will not reach 2 percent until 2019.\n\nTo sum up: The FOMC is undershooting its price stability goal.\n\nI’ve told you that inflation has been, is and will be too low relative to the FOMC’s target of 2 percent. But why should you care that inflation is too low? Isn’t it a good thing when goods and services aren’t as expensive to buy? The answer to this—very good—question is: You should care because below-target inflation signals a significant problem in our economy.\n\nLet me explain what I mean. At a basic level, you should think of prices as a signal about how our economy is using its available resources. In 2012, I had an experience that brought home this intuition in a very clear way. I visited Williston, on the western edge of North Dakota. As it is today, when I visited Williston, it was in the heart of a major oil boom. That boom was pushing hard on the physical resources—like roads, water, housing—available to Williston and pushing hard on the human resources available to Williston. The result was relatively high inflation.\n\nSo, when inflation is high compared to the Fed’s target, like it was in Williston, we know that demand is pushing hard on available resources. The converse is also true: Inflation is low compared to the Fed’s target when the demand for goods and services is too low to fully use the available resources in society. The low inflation in the United States tells us that resources are being wasted.\n\nWhat exactly are these wasted resources? There are multiple answers to this question—when demand is too low, lots of resources are left unused. But the biggest and most disturbing answer is our fellow Americans. There are many productive people in the United States available to work more hours, and our society is deprived of their production.\n\nThis key point is generally underappreciated. I’ve said that the FOMC is undershooting its price stability objective and is expected to continue to do so. But we should all keep in mind that this outcome—and especially the forecast for continued undershooting—typically means that the FOMC is also underperforming on its other objective of promoting maximum employment.\n\nI’ve argued that the low inflation rate is a signal that the FOMC is underperforming with respect to its maximum employment objective. But we don’t need to rely on this signal to reach this conclusion. We can readily see this underperformance in numerous key metrics of labor market performance.\n\nI’ll begin by showing you data on the evolution of the unemployment rate. In March 2007, the unemployment rate was 4.4 percent. It rose slowly throughout 2007 to reach 5 percent by the end of the year. The National Bureau of Economic Research dates the Great Recession as having begun in that month. In the wake of the recession, the unemployment rate reached a peak of 10 percent in October 2009.\n\nSince that date—over four years ago!—the unemployment rate has fallen slowly to 6.7 percent. This is still unusually high relative to the past quarter century or so. The current unemployment rate is also high relative to most forecasts of its expected long-run level. Personally, I expect that, over the long run, the unemployment rate will converge to just over 5 percent. Basically, an unemployment rate of 6.7 percent means that the U.S. labor market is far from healthy.\n\nBut I would say that this measure—troubling as it is—could well overstate the degree of improvement in the U.S. labor market. To estimate the unemployment rate, the Census Bureau asks people two questions: Are you working? And, if not, have you looked for work in the past four weeks? The unemployment rate measures the ratio of the second number—the recent job searchers—to the sum of the two numbers (the recent job searchers and the workers). This means that the unemployment rate can decline for two reasons: because more people are finding work or because fewer people are looking for work. Most of the declines in the unemployment rate since October 2009 have occurred because the fraction of people who are looking for work has fallen. This characterization is borne out if we look at the evolution of the fraction of people over the age of 16 who have a job—what’s called the employment-to-population ratio.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nIn March 2007, the employment-to-population ratio was over 63 percent. The employment-to-population ratio fell sharply during the Great Recession and bottomed out at just over 58 percent in mid-2011. The percentage has risen little from this low point and remains lower than at any time between 1986 and 2007.\n\nIt is true that, even without the Great Recession, demographic forces would have led to some decline in the employment-to-population ratio since 2007. As the baby boom birth cohort—born between 1946 and 1964—ages, the fraction of retirees in the population grows steadily. But these demographic forces are still not large enough to account for most of the decline in the employment-to-population ratio that I’ve described. One way to see this—but not the only way—is to focus on people who are outside the normal retirement age. Here, I’ve plotted the fraction of the population aged 25 to 54 who have a job. This ratio has improved from its low point, but also remains lower than at any time between 1986 and 2007.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nEven among those who have a job, there are signs that the economy is significantly underemploying our human resources. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports each month on the number of Americans who are working part time, would like to work more hours, but are unable to obtain those additional hours. That fraction of the labor force has fallen, but remains unusually high.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nTo summarize what we learn from the charts: The good news is that the labor market has improved since the end of the Great Recession. The bad news is that the rate of improvement over the past four-plus years has been painfully slow. As a consequence, there is still significant underutilization of our country’s most important resource—its people. We have to conclude that the FOMC is underperforming with respect to its goal of promoting maximum employment.\n\nEarlier, I asked you to consider this speech as a report to you, the people of Rochester, on the FOMC’s performance with respect to its two congressionally mandated objectives. We’ve seen that the FOMC is undershooting its price stability objective, in that inflation is running well below the FOMC’s goal of 2 percent and is expected to remain that low for several years. The undershooting is problematic because it suggests that the American economy is wasting available resources, especially its human resources. We’ve seen strong evidence of this underutilization in the performance of key labor market metrics. Hence, the FOMC is also underperforming with respect to its maximum employment objective. We need to do better as a Committee—and I look forward to working with my colleagues to make that happen.\n\nThank you for listening. I’d be happy to take your questions."

            "content": "Thank you all for coming out tonight to take part in this public discussion about the Federal Reserve, monetary policy and the economy. As many of you know, this event is part of a broader series that we call Conversations with the Fed, which has featured presentations on issues ranging from financial payments to the health of the banking industry to the size of the Fed’s balance sheet. All of these events have been well attended and, like good economists, we have duly noted this demand and plan to continue to supply these events in the future.\nToday’s conversation is taking place in the headquarters of the Ninth (of 12) Federal Reserve districts. But the Ninth District is a far-flung one that includes the states of Montana, North and South Dakota, Minnesota and parts of Wisconsin and Michigan. For that reason, we hold similar conversations throughout the Ninth District. Indeed, we’re redoubling those efforts this calendar year in honor of the centennial of the opening of the 12 Reserve Banks and the start of the work undertaken by the Federal Reserve System. The video that we just watched gives you an overview of some of that work by the people who are actually doing it: the many employees of the Federal Reserve System. We also have a new website we’ve created at federalreservehistory.org. I encourage you to visit this site to learn more about the people, places and events that have shaped Federal Reserve history.\nThere are some fascinating historical tidbits on the website that I could go on about at length, but I realize you all may not be quite as excited about Fed history as I am. I will say that if you have even the slightest curiosity about things like how the cities were chosen to host Reserve Banks, I would encourage you to attend an installment of Conversations with the Fed on May 8. It will feature Niel Willardson, our general counsel and corporate secretary, who be talking about the history of the Federal Reserve Act and answering the perennial question of why Minneapolis and not St. Paul.\nI won’t steal Niel’s thunder for that presentation, but I do want to address one of the things that I think has changed the most over the Federal Reserve’s history, and that is our communication with the public. A hundred years ago, Congress created a system that was designed specifically so that the residents of Main Street would have a voice in monetary policy. The ways in which we gathered information from Main Street have obviously changed considerably over the years, as new technologies have come into being, but this fact-finding continues to be an important part of how we conduct monetary policy.\nCommunication is a two-way street, however. During the past century, the Federal Reserve’s communications to the public about its monetary policy actions have also evolved greatly. The pace of change has been especially rapid in the past eight years under Chairman Bernanke’s leadership. During that time, the Federal Reserve has specified an explicit target for inflation, begun holding regular press conferences and greatly expanded its use of forward guidance—that is, its communications about the likely future evolution of policy.\nSo, as the Federal Reserve System plans for its second century, I would say that the importance of two-way communication is a key lesson from the System’s first century. In order for the Fed to continue to be effective, it needs to communicate its policy decisions transparently to the public. Conversely, it also needs the public’s input on how those policies are affecting them. Events like the one today are a key part of fostering that two-way communication.\nWith that as context, let me turn now to the business at hand: the current state of the economy. Throughout my remarks, I’ll be referring to the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC. It meets eight times per year to set the course of monetary policy in the United States. The presidents of the 12 Reserve Banks and the governors of the Federal Reserve System all participate fully in the deliberations at those meetings. However, only the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and four other presidents actually vote on the Committee’s actions. This last set of four presidents changes annually. In 2014, I will be a voting member, along with the presidents of the Philadelphia, Cleveland and Dallas Federal Reserve Banks. As you listen to me talk about the economy and the stance of monetary policy, always remember: The views you will hear tonight are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\nCongress has mandated that the FOMC make monetary policy so as to promote two objectives: price stability and maximum employment. Beginning in 2012, the Committee has explicitly translated the first goal into a 2 percent target for personal consumption expenditure, or PCE, inflation. This is a measure of inflation that includes all goods and services, including those related to food and energy. The Committee’s second goal—maximum employment—is less rigid, because long-run employment is influenced by many variables outside the control of monetary policy. However, most FOMC participants project that, over the longer run, unemployment will be between 5 percent and 6 percent if monetary policy keeps inflation close to 2 percent.\nIt is useful to examine the recent evolution of the economy in light of these two objectives. First, I will show you data on the unemployment rate over the past 30 years or so. You can see that the unemployment rate peaked at 10 percent after the Great Recession. It has fallen disturbingly slowly. Indeed, you can see on this graph that the unemployment rate fell much more rapidly in 1983 and 1984 after peaking at over 10 percent.\nLarge chart\nSecond, I will show you data on PCE inflation. Since the beginning of the Great Recession, PCE inflation has averaged only 1.5 percent—well under the FOMC’s target of 2 percent. Note too that PCE inflation has trended downward since early 2012 and is currently running at close to 1 percent.\nLarge chart\nThese graphs show us the past, but what about the future? The FOMC has said that, under its current monetary policy stance, it expects the unemployment rate to decline gradually to desirable levels. It has said too that it expects inflation to move back toward 2 percent over the medium term. By easing monetary policy relative to its current stance, the FOMC could facilitate a more rapid fall in unemployment and more rapid return to 2 percent inflation. Hence, the Committee could do better with respect to both of its congressionally mandated objectives by adopting a more accommodative monetary policy stance.\nThat concludes my formal remarks. Thank you all once again for joining us here tonight, and now I look forward to fielding your questions.\n\nThank you all for coming out tonight to take part in this public discussion about the Federal Reserve, monetary policy and the economy.

            "content": "Note 1\nI’d like to use this opportunity to talk about the role of economic research and economists within a Reserve Bank. My main theme is that, to be successful at their host of responsibilities, Reserve Banks need economists with a wide range of perspectives and skills. Conversely, economists in a variety of fields can enjoy fulfilling and successful careers at Reserve Banks. I’ll illustrate my points by using examples from my own institution, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.\nThe views that I express today are my own and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System, including my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\nMy first observation is that, just like economists who work at universities and colleges, many economists within Reserve Banks spend a great deal of time on independent research. Many Reserve Banks—including the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank—have found that, especially over the longer term, this self-directed research has the power to create valuable new insights into important public policy questions. For example, back in the 1990s, Harold Cole and Lee Ohanian—then at the Minneapolis Fed—developed an exciting and important new way to think about the slow recovery during the Great Depression.2 This work in economic history has turned out to be a valuable resource for many who are thinking about the current slow recovery.\nOver the past four decades in Minneapolis, we have found that, to be effective, independent research should follow the usual rules of academic economics. More specifically, economists must be free to pursue any question, use any available tools and arrive at any answer. The quality of those answers is ultimately measured by rigorous academic peer review, not by internal managerial judgment.\nSo, university and Reserve Bank jobs are not all that different in terms of the role of independent research. What distinguishes academic jobs from Reserve Bank jobs for economists is how they spend their non-research time. Economists with academic jobs spend most of their non-research time teaching. Economists with Reserve Bank jobs spend most of their non-research time supporting public policy work. As I stated at the outset, my main theme today is that public policy work in a Reserve Bank relies on a much wider variety of economic specializations than might be generally appreciated.\nI’ll start by talking about the most visible of the Fed’s public policy responsibilities: monetary policy. The president of each Reserve Bank participates in the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. Economists play a key role in briefing and generally supporting their president’s involvement in those meetings. I’m sure that I won’t be telling the people in this room anything new when I say that many of these economists are skilled at macroeconomic modeling. Indeed, there are many kinds of macroeconomic models, grounded in a wide range of underlying perspectives. To be most effective, an FOMC participant’s support team has to engage fully with this plethora of approaches.\nI suspect, too, that many in this room will not be surprised to hear that to be effective, presidents of Reserve Banks need support from economists with expertise in financial economics. After all, the Fed implements its monetary policy actions through financial market transactions. Monetary policy advice needs to be grounded in a keen understanding of financial markets, and the linkages between those markets and the broader macroeconomy. As well, financial markets are important to policymakers as a source of information about the public’s expectations for the future. At the Minneapolis Fed, we continue to work on how best to use information in asset prices—as encoded in so-called risk-neutral probabilities—to inform monetary policy choices.3 This is a joint effort that involves several parts of the Bank, and we have benefited from interactions with other economists around the System and in academe. We see it as a critical area for future research.\nWhat is perhaps less understood is that people who are not specialists in macroeconomics or finance also play a key role in monetary policy support. For example, the Fed is charged with making monetary policy so as to promote maximum employment. The challenge is that the level of employment that is indeed maximal is largely outside the control of monetary policy and, moreover, varies over time. Hence, the Fed engages in continual efforts to obtain measures of the maximum level of employment. These efforts are fundamentally grounded in the work of many labor economists around the System, but I’ll cite an important recent example done in Minneapolis. My research director, Sam Schulhofer-Wohl, and his co-author and former Minneapolis Fed economist Greg Kaplan closely studied the recent decline in internal migration in the United States.4 Some policymakers had expressed concern that this decline indicated that the Great Recession had caused a sudden increase in structural unemployment. But Sam and Greg’s research provided compelling evidence that this view was mistaken—rather, the decline in internal migration was better understood as being part of a very long-run trend.\nLet me transit to another Fed responsibility: supervision of financial institutions. The financial crisis made clear the fundamental linkage between the condition of large financial institutions and the macroeconomy. That lesson has translated into a more complete integration of economists—with expertise in banking, finance and macroeconomics—and the supervision of financial institutions. Monetary policymakers continually assess systemic financial risks, and this assessment is informed in part by supervisory information. Conversely, economists contribute to the supervision process by helping to build a better understanding of risks that face the financial sector.\nI could illustrate this Systemwide effort to build more connections between economics and supervision in many ways. I’ll just mention two of the several lines of attack undertaken in Minneapolis. Minneapolis Fed economist Motohiro Yogo and his co-author Ralph Koijen are studying the incentive effects of regulatory policies on insurers’ risk-taking. Their work has shed important new light on “shadow insurance” risks from off-balance-sheet liabilities of life insurance companies.5 As well, my head of supervision, Ron Feldman, and his team are using option price data—again, as encoded in risk-neutral probabilities—as a source of information about tail risks for large financial institutions.6\nI’ve talked a lot about monetary policy and the supervision of financial institutions. But these are only two of the many public policy roles of Reserve Banks. Let me briefly mention a couple more: the payments system and community development. Reserve Banks have recently formulated an ambitious strategic plan regarding their responsibilities in the payments system—the variety of mechanisms by which people and businesses transfer funds to one another. This strategic plan was informed in part by contributions from a large number of economists around the System who specialize in payments systems. In terms of community development, Reserve Banks engage in a number of activities to encourage private-sector investment in low- and moderate-income communities. Microeconomic analysis underpins these activities in important ways. For example, in Minneapolis, over the past dozen years, our Community Development function has worked closely with tribal representatives on initiatives to help Native American tribes select and build a sound legal infrastructure that can support private business development in Indian Country. We are engaged in efforts to buttress this work by using microeconometric techniques to measure the impact of these legal infrastructure improvements on economic outcomes.\nI have argued that Reserve Banks need a wide range of skills and perspectives to fulfill their public policy missions. These considerations have helped inform the evolution of our Research department in Minneapolis in the past four plus years since I became president. In that time, we’ve greatly expanded the group, by hiring folks from top universities like Stanford, Penn and Princeton, as well as from elsewhere in the Federal Reserve System. These new economists have skills in financial economics, labor economics, international economics, econometric forecasting and monetary economics. The department’s expansion has helped make the Minneapolis Fed even more agile and effective with respect to its public policy contributions, while maintaining its historical excellence with respect to independent research.\nBut the skill diversity that I’ve been emphasizing is valued throughout the Federal Reserve System, not just in Minneapolis. To see this, one need not look any further than the key Research leadership positions around the Federal Reserve System. The Research director in Philadelphia is an economist with expertise in banking. The Research director in Chicago is an economist with expertise in labor economics and industrial organization. The Research director in New York is an economist with expertise in payments systems.\nI’ve described a Federal Reserve System in which each Reserve Bank has a broad-based group of economists. Some listeners might ask: Why not put all the economists in Washington? Or why not have each bank specialize in a different subfield of economics? I have a couple of answers to these questions. The first is grounded in the nature of monetary policymaking at the Federal Reserve. The essence of the Federal Reserve System is that each of the 12 Reserve Bank presidents brings a distinct perspective to monetary policy deliberations. But these perspectives need to be appropriately informed by economic analysis—and, as I’ve argued, that kind of support requires a broad range of skills to be effective.\nSecond, I view geographic diversity as a necessary ingredient to generating valuable intellectual diversity across the System. Back in the 1970s, the Minneapolis Fed Research department played a key role in fostering the “rational expectations revolution” that has helped transform the making of monetary policy around the world. Would these economists have played this same role had they been working in Washington—or anywhere else in the System, for that matter? I believe that the answer to this question is no. The ideas in the Research department were generated by synergistic interactions between Minneapolis Fed economists and University of Minnesota economists—synergies that owed a lot to the geographical proximity between the two institutions. I see those same intellectual synergies as critical to the Minneapolis Fed’s, and the System’s, thinking as we move forward.\nLet me sum up.\nMost of you know that many economists work in Reserve Banks. What I wanted to communicate to you today is that these economists have many different fields of specialization. This diversity is essential—Reserve Banks need that large variety of skills to fulfill our public policy missions. As a result, many kinds of economists can enjoy successful careers within the Federal Reserve. What it takes to be successful in our organization as an economist is extraordinary dedication to, and belief in, our public policy mission.\nEndnotes\n1 I thank Dave Fettig and Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for their helpful comments.\n2 See Harold L.

My main theme is that, to be successful at their host of responsibilities, Reserve Banks need economists with a wide range of perspectives and skills. Conversely, economists in a variety of fields can enjoy fulfilling and successful careers at Reserve Banks. I’ll illustrate my points by using examples from my own institution, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.\n\nThe views that I express today are my own and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System, including my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nMy first observation is that, just like economists who work at universities and colleges, many economists within Reserve Banks spend a great deal of time on independent research. Many Reserve Banks—including the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank—have found that, especially over the longer term, this self-directed research has the power to create valuable new insights into important public policy questions. For example, back in the 1990s, Harold Cole and Lee Ohanian—then at the Minneapolis Fed—developed an exciting and important new way to think about the slow recovery during the Great Depression.2 This work in economic history has turned out to be a valuable resource for many who are thinking about the current slow recovery.\n\nOver the past four decades in Minneapolis, we have found that, to be effective, independent research should follow the usual rules of academic economics. More specifically, economists must be free to pursue any question, use any available tools and arrive at any answer. The quality of those answers is ultimately measured by rigorous academic peer review, not by internal managerial judgment.\n\nSo, university and Reserve Bank jobs are not all that different in terms of the role of independent research. What distinguishes academic jobs from Reserve Bank jobs for economists is how they spend their non-research time. Economists with academic jobs spend most of their non-research time teaching. Economists with Reserve Bank jobs spend most of their non-research time supporting public policy work. As I stated at the outset, my main theme today is that public policy work in a Reserve Bank relies on a much wider variety of economic specializations than might be generally appreciated.\n\nI’ll start by talking about the most visible of the Fed’s public policy responsibilities: monetary policy. The president of each Reserve Bank participates in the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. Economists play a key role in briefing and generally supporting their president’s involvement in those meetings. I’m sure that I won’t be telling the people in this room anything new when I say that many of these economists are skilled at macroeconomic modeling. Indeed, there are many kinds of macroeconomic models, grounded in a wide range of underlying perspectives. To be most effective, an FOMC participant’s support team has to engage fully with this plethora of approaches.\n\nI suspect, too, that many in this room will not be surprised to hear that to be effective, presidents of Reserve Banks need support from economists with expertise in financial economics. After all, the Fed implements its monetary policy actions through financial market transactions. Monetary policy advice needs to be grounded in a keen understanding of financial markets, and the linkages between those markets and the broader macroeconomy. As well, financial markets are important to policymakers as a source of information about the public’s expectations for the future. At the Minneapolis Fed, we continue to work on how best to use information in asset prices—as encoded in so-called risk-neutral probabilities—to inform monetary policy choices.3 This is a joint effort that involves several parts of the Bank, and we have benefited from interactions with other economists around the System and in academe. We see it as a critical area for future research.\n\nWhat is perhaps less understood is that people who are not specialists in macroeconomics or finance also play a key role in monetary policy support. For example, the Fed is charged with making monetary policy so as to promote maximum employment. The challenge is that the level of employment that is indeed maximal is largely outside the control of monetary policy and, moreover, varies over time. Hence, the Fed engages in continual efforts to obtain measures of the maximum level of employment. These efforts are fundamentally grounded in the work of many labor economists around the System, but I’ll cite an important recent example done in Minneapolis. My research director, Sam Schulhofer-Wohl, and his co-author and former Minneapolis Fed economist Greg Kaplan closely studied the recent decline in internal migration in the United States.4 Some policymakers had expressed concern that this decline indicated that the Great Recession had caused a sudden increase in structural unemployment. But Sam and Greg’s research provided compelling evidence that this view was mistaken—rather, the decline in internal migration was better understood as being part of a very long-run trend.\n\nLet me transit to another Fed responsibility: supervision of financial institutions. The financial crisis made clear the fundamental linkage between the condition of large financial institutions and the macroeconomy. That lesson has translated into a more complete integration of economists—with expertise in banking, finance and macroeconomics—and the supervision of financial institutions. Monetary policymakers continually assess systemic financial risks, and this assessment is informed in part by supervisory information. Conversely, economists contribute to the supervision process by helping to build a better understanding of risks that face the financial sector.\n\nI could illustrate this Systemwide effort to build more connections between economics and supervision in many ways. I’ll just mention two of the several lines of attack undertaken in Minneapolis. Minneapolis Fed economist Motohiro Yogo and his co-author Ralph Koijen are studying the incentive effects of regulatory policies on insurers’ risk-taking. Their work has shed important new light on “shadow insurance” risks from off-balance-sheet liabilities of life insurance companies.5 As well, my head of supervision, Ron Feldman, and his team are using option price data—again, as encoded in risk-neutral probabilities—as a source of information about tail risks for large financial institutions.6\n\nI’ve talked a lot about monetary policy and the supervision of financial institutions. But these are only two of the many public policy roles of Reserve Banks. Let me briefly mention a couple more: the payments system and community development. Reserve Banks have recently formulated an ambitious strategic plan regarding their responsibilities in the payments system—the variety of mechanisms by which people and businesses transfer funds to one another. This strategic plan was informed in part by contributions from a large number of economists around the System who specialize in payments systems. In terms of community development, Reserve Banks engage in a number of activities to encourage private-sector investment in low- and moderate-income communities. Microeconomic analysis underpins these activities in important ways. For example, in Minneapolis, over the past dozen years, our Community Development function has worked closely with tribal representatives on initiatives to help Native American tribes select and build a sound legal infrastructure that can support private business development in Indian Country. We are engaged in efforts to buttress this work by using microeconometric techniques to measure the impact of these legal infrastructure improvements on economic outcomes.\n\nI have argued that Reserve Banks need a wide range of skills and perspectives to fulfill their public policy missions. These considerations have helped inform the evolution of our Research department in Minneapolis in the past four plus years since I became president. In that time, we’ve greatly expanded the group, by hiring folks from top universities like Stanford, Penn and Princeton, as well as from elsewhere in the Federal Reserve System. These new economists have skills in financial economics, labor economics, international economics, econometric forecasting and monetary economics. The department’s expansion has helped make the Minneapolis Fed even more agile and effective with respect to its public policy contributions, while maintaining its historical excellence with respect to independent research.\n\nBut the skill diversity that I’ve been emphasizing is valued throughout the Federal Reserve System, not just in Minneapolis. To see this, one need not look any further than the key Research leadership positions around the Federal Reserve System. The Research director in Philadelphia is an economist with expertise in banking. The Research director in Chicago is an economist with expertise in labor economics and industrial organization. The Research director in New York is an economist with expertise in payments systems.\n\nI’ve described a Federal Reserve System in which each Reserve Bank has a broad-based group of economists. Some listeners might ask: Why not put all the economists in Washington? Or why not have each bank specialize in a different subfield of economics? I have a couple of answers to these questions. The first is grounded in the nature of monetary policymaking at the Federal Reserve. The essence of the Federal Reserve System is that each of the 12 Reserve Bank presidents brings a distinct perspective to monetary policy deliberations. But these perspectives need to be appropriately informed by economic analysis—and, as I’ve argued, that kind of support requires a broad range of skills to be effective.\n\nSecond, I view geographic diversity as a necessary ingredient to generating valuable intellectual diversity across the System. Back in the 1970s, the Minneapolis Fed Research department played a key role in fostering the “rational expectations revolution” that has helped transform the making of monetary policy around the world. Would these economists have played this same role had they been working in Washington—or anywhere else in the System, for that matter? I believe that the answer to this question is no. The ideas in the Research department were generated by synergistic interactions between Minneapolis Fed economists and University of Minnesota economists—synergies that owed a lot to the geographical proximity between the two institutions. I see those same intellectual synergies as critical to the Minneapolis Fed’s, and the System’s, thinking as we move forward.\n\nLet me sum up.\n\nMost of you know that many economists work in Reserve Banks. What I wanted to communicate to you today is that these economists have many different fields of specialization. This diversity is essential—Reserve Banks need that large variety of skills to fulfill our public policy missions. As a result, many kinds of economists can enjoy successful careers within the Federal Reserve. What it takes to be successful in our organization as an economist is extraordinary dedication to, and belief in, our public policy mission."

At that moment in time, my infant research agenda was largely a spillover of Lars’ own powerful agenda. Over the intervening time period, though, our career tracks have led us in different directions. Somewhat to my surprise, by the end of my academic career in 2009, I generally found myself being labeled as an economic theorist by most other economists. (I say “most other economists” because I generally found that theorists themselves wanted to label me something else!) And in 2009, I left the academe to become a monetary policymaker. That’s a step that Lars has not made—at least not yet.\nSo, Lars and I have taken different paths in our lives. Nonetheless, Lars has been a role model for me throughout my professional life—a person whose example I’ve striven to follow. Through our interactions over the past 25 years and more, he has taught me many important lessons. I’ll use my brief time to talk about two of those lessons: the power of mathematics and the value of persistence.\nI’ll start with the power of mathematics. Early on in his time as my adviser, Lars gave me a page and a half of comments on what was to become the main chapter of my dissertation. Unfortunately, I’m not much of a pack rat, and so I have not kept a copy of those comments—now, they’d probably be worth millions on eBay.\nBut one of Lars’ comments has stuck in my mind. It was typically pithy: Use L∞, not L2. I’m sure that most of you are having the same reaction that I did at the time: What? Abandon the wonderful inner product structure of L2? That’s sure going to make the proofs a lot harder. I’m sure that you can all empathize with the deep longing for inner products that I felt back then.\nI went away and thought about this statement—use L∞ and not L2. After some period of time—really, no more than a decade or so—I figured out why Lars had said what he said. So, when Mikhail Golosov, Aleh Tsyvinski and I wrote a paper together on optimal taxation in the early 2000s, we followed the advice that Lars had given me as a student and used L∞ as the basis of our mathematics. By doing so, we were able to show that our results were surprisingly fundamental, in the sense that they could be derived in a wide class of seemingly disparate economic models.\nI think that this little story is illustrative of what I see as a basic message from Lars’ research: It takes harder mathematics—in my story, L∞ math—to get closer to economic fundamentals. A lot of economic and econometric analysis relies on a host of auxiliary assumptions that really have nothing to do with economics—for example, assumptions about serially independent errors. We can cross our fingers—but we have no way of knowing whether these auxiliary assumptions are ultimately responsible for our results.\nTo a remarkable extent, Lars’ econometric and economic analyses dispense with these auxiliary assumptions. Doing the analysis without those assumptions requires harder math. But here’s the true irony. Because the harder math allows us to get rid of the technical assumptions, the harder math gets us much closer to understanding the core implications of economics itself. And I believe that this is exactly why the generalized method of moments has become so widely used in economics and other social sciences.\nLet me move on to the second of the lessons that I learned from Lars that I want to mention today: the value of persistence. The power of Lars’ remarkably assumption-free approach to asset pricing is now obvious to us. But I was there almost at the beginning—and, 25 years ago, I remember that the approach seemed overly abstract and mathy to many. It took persistence on Lars’ part to overcome those sentiments and get his ideas the widespread acceptance that they now enjoy.\nMy own experience as a researcher was that persistence was incredibly important. Whenever I came up with a new idea, I was told—by many people—that the idea had to be wrong. Time would pass. And many of those same folks would come and tell me that they had decided that the idea was not wrong. Instead, they had a fresh criticism—they had decided that the idea was obvious to the point of banality. For you young researchers out there, that’s called “winning them over.”\nSo, those are two of the many lessons that I learned from Lars—the power of mathematics and the value of persistence. I’ll close by saying why I have been able to learn those lessons from him. One reason is that, of course, Lars is remarkably brilliant. But another is that Lars is remarkably generous with his time and his thinking. I used to work at the University of Iowa back in the early ’90s. I remember one of my colleagues there saying of Lars, “Lars Hansen makes everyone who ever talks to him a better economist.” Enough said.\nThanks, Lars.\n\nI got my economics Ph.D. from Chicago in the summer of 1987—over a quarter of a century ago.

            "content": "Note *\nThanks for the introduction, Ron. It’s a great pleasure to address all of you tonight. First off, let me say welcome to the Minneapolis Fed. I see this workshop as being one more step on an important intellectual journey for the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. That journey has been going on for many years—long before I became president of the Bank in 2009. As most of you know, my head of supervision, Ron Feldman, and my predecessor, Gary Stern, literally wrote the book on too-big-to-fail nearly 10 years ago.1 Like many others—and for the good of the country—I hope that our too-big-to-fail journey is complete before another decade passes. The work that all of you are doing is critical to making that hope a reality.\nMy theme tonight is that metrics should play a key role in the regulation and management of the too-big-to-fail (TBTF) problem. I will proceed in three steps. I’ll first define what I see as the TBTF problem. As you will hear, I see the TBTF problem as being about a particular kind of misallocation of resources—more specifically, excessively risky investments that are incented by the prospect of governmental absorption of losses that would otherwise be endured by creditors of financial institutions. Here, I want to emphasize the word “prospect.” In my formulation of the TBTF problem, it’s the expectation of government transfers that creates the problematic distortion, not the realization of those transfers.\nI’ll next turn to why I see metrics as being essential to the management of the TBTF problem. Without metrics, policymakers—and the public they serve—can have no true insight into the effectiveness of the current management of the problem. As this group well knows, any given measure of the size of the TBTF problem is imperfect. But I will argue that the imperfection of any single measure implies that policymakers should track progress using many measures, not ignore all of them.\nFinally, I’ll talk about two aspects of the use of metrics in the management of the TBTF problem: why it is important to use measures besides size and why it may be important to assess the robustness of TBTF measures to certain kinds of shocks.\nMy remarks today reflect my own views, and are not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nDefining the TBTF Problem\nLet me start, then, by defining what I mean by the TBTF problem. I use this term to refer to a type of inefficiency in the allocation of societal resources. In particular, I’m referring to the excessively risky investments that are incented when creditors of a financial institution believe that there is some likelihood that at least some of their losses will be absorbed by the government.\nI know that the nature of this inefficiency is familiar to all of you in this room, but let me talk through it more carefully. Imagine first that creditors did not anticipate any form of governmental loss absorption. Then, if a financial institution decided to increase the risk level of its investment portfolio, its debt holders would face a greater risk of loss. By way of compensation for that greater risk, they’d demand a higher yield. As a result, in the absence of government guarantees, financial institutions would find it more costly to obtain debt financing for highly risky investments than for less risky ones. This effect, on the margin, would curb a firm’s appetite for risk.\nBut now suppose instead that a financial institution’s creditors believe that they are partially insulated from losses. Then, those creditors do not demand a sufficiently high yield when they lend to riskier institutions. Financial institutions take on too much risk, because they are no longer deterred from doing so by the high cost of debt finance.\nThere are two particular aspects of this definition that are worth noting. First, it is an ex ante definition—I’m not referring to the ex post manifestation of governmental loss absorption in the form of transfers or bailouts. In my formulation, the damage to society through the misallocation of resources has already occurred by the time the government actually makes transfers or undertakes bailouts. To be clear—like many other observers, I do find it troubling when governments use funds from relatively poor taxpayers to protect relatively rich bank bondholders from losses. But I’m not using the term TBTF problem to refer to concerns about this kind of redistribution.\nSecond, the definition emphasizes the role of creditor beliefs about prospective governmental transfers. The beliefs of other parties are much less relevant. For example, to the management or board of directors of a given financial institution, the TBTF problem simply means that their costs of debt finance are relatively unaffected by the amount of risk in their firm’s investment portfolio.\nThe Need to Use Metrics\nAs I’ve defined it, the TBTF problem involves a misallocation of resources. At the direction of legislators, bank regulators and bank supervisors have taken a variety of steps intended to reduce or end this misallocation. As a result, the public knows that large financial institutions have more and better capital than they did five years ago. As well, the public also knows that these institutions have constructed lengthy plans—so-called living wills—that describe their strategies for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure.\nWhat the public does not know is whether the adoption of these steps has been associated with a material change in the size of the TBTF problem. My main theme tonight is that policymakers can only identify and document progress in the reduction of the TBTF problem by using measures of the magnitude of the TBTF problem.\nThe good news is that it is clear what we want to measure. The heart of the TBTF problem is that some financial institutions are able to borrow too cheaply in light of the risks in their investment portfolios. What we need to measure, then, is the size of that subsidy to debt finance. Of course, as this group well knows, that conceptual formulation of the problem only gets us so far. Actually constructing reliable measures of this subsidy has a number of challenges—and that’s why this workshop is important.\nAdmittedly, at this point in time—and probably for some time to come—every measure has to be seen as imperfect. Some might conclude from these imperfections that it would be inappropriate to track progress with respect to TBTF using any of these measures. I cannot emphasize how wrong I believe this conclusion to be. Rather than using no measures, policymakers should be tracking all measures that are viewed as being at least somewhat informative about the size of the subsidy.\nHere, I find an analogy from the monetary policy part of my job to be helpful. The Federal Open Market Committee is charged by Congress with promoting price stability and maximum employment. There are relatively uncontroversial metrics that we can use to track progress on the former objective. But it is not as obvious how we should track progress with respect to the latter objective. Every possible metric—be it the unemployment rate or the employment-population ratio—has its own flaws.\nBut the response of the FOMC is hardly to abandon metrics altogether. Instead, monetary policymakers track labor market performance using a large number of measures. For example, in a speech earlier this month, the president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve, James Bullard, depicted recent labor market improvement along a variety of dimensions using an elegant spider chart.2 I could well see similar charts as being useful in providing the public with assessments of the size of the TBTF problem for a given financial institution.\nTwo Comments\nLet me close by offering two comments about TBTF metrics.\nThe first comment is again aimed more at people outside this room than inside it. Some observers are drawn to using the size of a financial institution as a sufficient statistic for the magnitude of the TBTF problem associated with that institution. After all, it’s called the too-big-to-fail problem! This kind of approach would suggest that society can best manage the too-big-to-fail problem by capping the size of financial institutions.\nI do agree with these observers that the size of a financial institution is likely to be a useful source of information about the magnitude of that institution’s TBTF problem. At the same time, though, policymakers should guard against relying too much on this single metric. We should always keep in mind that the term too-big-to-fail is highly misleading. The TBTF problem is about creditor perceptions of loss protection. Creditors might well see the smaller of two institutions as being more likely to receive that protection, if the smaller institution is engaged in some kind of activity that is seen by government agencies as being especially vital. Thus, if we go back to 2008, government funds were used to facilitate the purchase of Bear Stearns by JP Morgan Chase. No such government funds were made available to facilitate the resolution of Lehman—and Lehman was certainly larger than Bear Stearns.\nThe second comment is about the need to assess the robustness of TBTF measures to particular kinds of shocks. I defined the TBTF problem in terms of the subsidy to debt finance created by the possibility of governmental loss absorption. Certainly, policymakers can only claim success with respect to the TBTF problem if the current measures of that subsidy are low.\nHowever, they may want to accomplish more. The TBTF subsidy to a financial institution is generated by its creditors’ perceptions of government loss absorption. The subsidy will be worth little if creditors believe that the institution’s assets have little risk, so that it is highly unlikely that the institution will ever incur losses for the government to absorb. It may be prudent for supervisors and regulators to also check that the subsidy remains small if creditors begin to perceive the institution’s asset risk as materially larger. I see such robustness checks as being challenging to implement with existing TBTF metrics.\nConclusions\nLet me wrap up by returning to my main theme: the need to use metrics in the management of the TBTF problem, however imperfect those metrics might be.\nBasically, the issue comes down to accountability. Again, I find a monetary policy analogy to be helpful. As monetary policymakers, my colleagues on the FOMC and I are accountable for keeping the economy at maximum employment. We are well aware that we need metrics to demonstrate that we are making progress with respect to that responsibility. No one metric is perfect—and so we refer to a wide variety of somewhat informative measures. And the Federal Reserve System spends a great deal of time trying to develop other—again imperfect—measures to supplement those that we already have.\nI see the TBTF problem as highly similar. Supervisors and regulators have been made accountable by Congress for ending the TBTF problem. They need to be able to demonstrate clear progress to the public with respect to that responsibility. They can only do so using the metrics in this workshop and metrics that will be developed in workshops still to come.\nThanks to all of you for listening and for coming to Minneapolis.\nNote\n* I thank David Fettig, Terry Fitzgerald, and Ron Feldman for their help in preparing these remarks.\nEndnotes\n1 Stern, Gary H., and Ron J.

As you will hear, I see the TBTF problem as being about a particular kind of misallocation of resources—more specifically, excessively risky investments that are incented by the prospect of governmental absorption of losses that would otherwise be endured by creditors of financial institutions. Here, I want to emphasize the word “prospect.” In my formulation of the TBTF problem, it’s the expectation of government transfers that creates the problematic distortion, not the realization of those transfers.\n\nI’ll next turn to why I see metrics as being essential to the management of the TBTF problem. Without metrics, policymakers—and the public they serve—can have no true insight into the effectiveness of the current management of the problem. As this group well knows, any given measure of the size of the TBTF problem is imperfect. But I will argue that the imperfection of any single measure implies that policymakers should track progress using many measures, not ignore all of them.\n\nFinally, I’ll talk about two aspects of the use of metrics in the management of the TBTF problem: why it is important to use measures besides size and why it may be important to assess the robustness of TBTF measures to certain kinds of shocks.\n\nMy remarks today reflect my own views, and are not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nLet me start, then, by defining what I mean by the TBTF problem. I use this term to refer to a type of inefficiency in the allocation of societal resources. In particular, I’m referring to the excessively risky investments that are incented when creditors of a financial institution believe that there is some likelihood that at least some of their losses will be absorbed by the government.\n\nI know that the nature of this inefficiency is familiar to all of you in this room, but let me talk through it more carefully. Imagine first that creditors did not anticipate any form of governmental loss absorption. Then, if a financial institution decided to increase the risk level of its investment portfolio, its debt holders would face a greater risk of loss. By way of compensation for that greater risk, they’d demand a higher yield. As a result, in the absence of government guarantees, financial institutions would find it more costly to obtain debt financing for highly risky investments than for less risky ones. This effect, on the margin, would curb a firm’s appetite for risk.\n\nBut now suppose instead that a financial institution’s creditors believe that they are partially insulated from losses. Then, those creditors do not demand a sufficiently high yield when they lend to riskier institutions. Financial institutions take on too much risk, because they are no longer deterred from doing so by the high cost of debt finance.\n\nThere are two particular aspects of this definition that are worth noting. First, it is an ex ante definition—I’m not referring to the ex post manifestation of governmental loss absorption in the form of transfers or bailouts. In my formulation, the damage to society through the misallocation of resources has already occurred by the time the government actually makes transfers or undertakes bailouts. To be clear—like many other observers, I do find it troubling when governments use funds from relatively poor taxpayers to protect relatively rich bank bondholders from losses. But I’m not using the term TBTF problem to refer to concerns about this kind of redistribution.\n\nSecond, the definition emphasizes the role of creditor beliefs about prospective governmental transfers. The beliefs of other parties are much less relevant. For example, to the management or board of directors of a given financial institution, the TBTF problem simply means that their costs of debt finance are relatively unaffected by the amount of risk in their firm’s investment portfolio.\n\nAs I’ve defined it, the TBTF problem involves a misallocation of resources. At the direction of legislators, bank regulators and bank supervisors have taken a variety of steps intended to reduce or end this misallocation. As a result, the public knows that large financial institutions have more and better capital than they did five years ago. As well, the public also knows that these institutions have constructed lengthy plans—so-called living wills—that describe their strategies for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure.\n\nWhat the public does not know is whether the adoption of these steps has been associated with a material change in the size of the TBTF problem. My main theme tonight is that policymakers can only identify and document progress in the reduction of the TBTF problem by using measures of the magnitude of the TBTF problem.\n\nThe good news is that it is clear what we want to measure. The heart of the TBTF problem is that some financial institutions are able to borrow too cheaply in light of the risks in their investment portfolios. What we need to measure, then, is the size of that subsidy to debt finance. Of course, as this group well knows, that conceptual formulation of the problem only gets us so far. Actually constructing reliable measures of this subsidy has a number of challenges—and that’s why this workshop is important.\n\nAdmittedly, at this point in time—and probably for some time to come—every measure has to be seen as imperfect. Some might conclude from these imperfections that it would be inappropriate to track progress with respect to TBTF using any of these measures. I cannot emphasize how wrong I believe this conclusion to be. Rather than using no measures, policymakers should be tracking all measures that are viewed as being at least somewhat informative about the size of the subsidy.\n\nHere, I find an analogy from the monetary policy part of my job to be helpful. The Federal Open Market Committee is charged by Congress with promoting price stability and maximum employment. There are relatively uncontroversial metrics that we can use to track progress on the former objective. But it is not as obvious how we should track progress with respect to the latter objective. Every possible metric—be it the unemployment rate or the employment-population ratio—has its own flaws.\n\nBut the response of the FOMC is hardly to abandon metrics altogether. Instead, monetary policymakers track labor market performance using a large number of measures. For example, in a speech earlier this month, the president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve, James Bullard, depicted recent labor market improvement along a variety of dimensions using an elegant spider chart.2 I could well see similar charts as being useful in providing the public with assessments of the size of the TBTF problem for a given financial institution.\n\nLet me close by offering two comments about TBTF metrics.\n\nThe first comment is again aimed more at people outside this room than inside it. Some observers are drawn to using the size of a financial institution as a sufficient statistic for the magnitude of the TBTF problem associated with that institution. After all, it’s called the too-big-to-fail problem! This kind of approach would suggest that society can best manage the too-big-to-fail problem by capping the size of financial institutions.\n\nI do agree with these observers that the size of a financial institution is likely to be a useful source of information about the magnitude of that institution’s TBTF problem. At the same time, though, policymakers should guard against relying too much on this single metric. We should always keep in mind that the term too-big-to-fail is highly misleading. The TBTF problem is about creditor perceptions of loss protection. Creditors might well see the smaller of two institutions as being more likely to receive that protection, if the smaller institution is engaged in some kind of activity that is seen by government agencies as being especially vital. Thus, if we go back to 2008, government funds were used to facilitate the purchase of Bear Stearns by JP Morgan Chase. No such government funds were made available to facilitate the resolution of Lehman—and Lehman was certainly larger than Bear Stearns.\n\nThe second comment is about the need to assess the robustness of TBTF measures to particular kinds of shocks. I defined the TBTF problem in terms of the subsidy to debt finance created by the possibility of governmental loss absorption. Certainly, policymakers can only claim success with respect to the TBTF problem if the current measures of that subsidy are low.\n\nHowever, they may want to accomplish more. The TBTF subsidy to a financial institution is generated by its creditors’ perceptions of government loss absorption. The subsidy will be worth little if creditors believe that the institution’s assets have little risk, so that it is highly unlikely that the institution will ever incur losses for the government to absorb. It may be prudent for supervisors and regulators to also check that the subsidy remains small if creditors begin to perceive the institution’s asset risk as materially larger. I see such robustness checks as being challenging to implement with existing TBTF metrics.\n\nLet me wrap up by returning to my main theme: the need to use metrics in the management of the TBTF problem, however imperfect those metrics might be.\n\nBasically, the issue comes down to accountability. Again, I find a monetary policy analogy to be helpful. As monetary policymakers, my colleagues on the FOMC and I are accountable for keeping the economy at maximum employment. We are well aware that we need metrics to demonstrate that we are making progress with respect to that responsibility. No one metric is perfect—and so we refer to a wide variety of somewhat informative measures. And the Federal Reserve System spends a great deal of time trying to develop other—again imperfect—measures to supplement those that we already have.\n\nI see the TBTF problem as highly similar. Supervisors and regulators have been made accountable by Congress for ending the TBTF problem. They need to be able to demonstrate clear progress to the public with respect to that responsibility. They can only do so using the metrics in this workshop and metrics that will be developed in workshops still to come.\n\nThanks to all of you for listening and for coming to Minneapolis.\n\n1 Stern, Gary H., and Ron J.

            "content": "Note *\nThank you for that generous introduction, and thank you for the opportunity to join you here today. I would also like to thank those of you who met with me earlier this morning for a discussion about business prospects and the choices that many of you are facing. As I often note, those types of discussions are important in helping to frame my understanding of the state of the economy. As you will hear in a moment, expectations are key to monetary policymaking, and understanding what informs the expectations of those who must make hiring and pricing decisions is very useful.\nThe title of my speech today is “A Time of Testing.” Paul Volcker, then Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, used the same title for a speech that he gave on October 9, 1979. Chairman Volcker intended his title to underscore that monetary policymakers in 1979 were confronted with a severe test in the form of high inflation and high inflation expectations. I use the title today to underscore that monetary policymakers in 2013 are again confronted with a severe test—but this time a test created by low employment and low employment expectations. Back in 1979, Chairman Volcker said that “this is a time of testing—a testing not only of our capacity collectively to reach coherent and intelligent policies, but to stick with them”1 [italics mine]. My theme today is that his powerful phrase applies with equal force to our current situation.\nLet me give you a brief roadmap of where I plan to take you today.\nFirst, I will show you data that depict the painfully slow pace of recovery in the U.S. labor market. Second, I will show you data that demonstrate that there is considerable monetary policy capacity with which to address this problem. Third, I will take you back to 1979 and describe the nature of the problem that monetary policymakers faced then. I will describe how they dealt with those problems by using what I would call goal-oriented monetary policy. Fourth, I will argue that there are several key parallels between 1979 and 2013. Given those parallels, monetary policymakers can best deal with the current labor market problems by also adopting a goal-oriented approach to monetary policy. Unlike 1979, though, the goal-oriented approach to monetary policy will focus on improving labor market outcomes, as opposed to lowering inflation. Finally, I’ll draw some connections between a goal-oriented approach to monetary policy and the current public conversation about monetary policy. Throughout my remarks, I’ll be making reference to the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC for short. The Committee currently consists of the six governors of the Federal Reserve System and the 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve Banks, including me. Its job is to set monetary policy for the United States.\nAs you listen to me today, please keep in mind that my views are not necessarily those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System, including other Federal Open Market Committee participants.\nEvolution of Labor Market Outcomes since 2007\nI will begin by documenting the disturbing state of the labor market. I’ll start by showing you data on the evolution of the unemployment rate. In March 2007, the unemployment rate was 4.4 percent. It rose slowly throughout 2007 to reach 5.0 percent by the end of the year. The National Bureau of Economic Research dates the Great Recession as having begun in that month. In the wake of the recession, the unemployment rate reached a peak of 10 percent in October 2009.\nLarge chart\nSince that date—four years ago!—the unemployment rate has fallen slowly to 7.3 percent. This is still unusually high relative to the past quarter century or so: Between 1986 and 2007, the unemployment rate was only higher than 7.3 percent in 1992. The current unemployment rate is also high relative to most forecasts of its expected long-run level, including those made by the FOMC. Basically, an unemployment rate of 7.3 percent means that the U.S. labor market is far from healthy.\nBut I would say that this measure—troubling as it is—overstates the improvement in the U.S. labor market. To estimate the unemployment rate, the Census Bureau asks people two questions: Are you working? And, if not, have you looked for work in the past four weeks? The unemployment rate measures the ratio of the second number—the recent job searchers—to the sum of the two numbers (the recent job searchers and the workers). This means that the unemployment rate can decline for two reasons: because more people are finding work or because fewer people are choosing not to look for work. Most of the declines in the unemployment rate since October 2009 have occurred because the fraction of people who are choosing to look for work has fallen.\nThis characterization is borne out if we look at the evolution of the fraction of people over the age of 16 who have a job—what’s called the employment-to-population ratio. In March 2007, the employment-to-population ratio was over 63 percent. The employment-to-population ratio fell sharply during the Great Recession and bottomed out at just over 58 percent in mid-2011. The percentage has risen little from this low point and remains lower than at any time between 1986 and 2007.\nLarge chart\nIt is true that, even without the Great Recession, demographic forces would have led to some decline in the employment-to-population ratio since 2007. As the baby boom birth cohort—born between 1946 and 1964—ages, the fraction of retirees in the population grows steadily. But these demographic forces are simply too small to account for much of the decline in the employment-to-population ratio that I’ve described. One way to see this—but not the only way—is to focus on people who are outside the normal retirement age. Here, I’ve plotted the fraction of the population aged 25 to 54 who have a job. This ratio has improved somewhat more from its low point, but also remains lower than at any time between 1986 and 2007.\nLarge chart\nTo summarize what we learn from the charts: The good news is that the labor market has improved since the end of the Great Recession. The bad news is that the rate of improvement over the past four years has been painfully slow. As a consequence, the condition of the labor market remains weak.\nThere are two aspects of the labor market situation that are worth emphasizing. First, the weak labor market represents considerable hardship for a large number of Americans, both in economic terms and in psychological terms. Second, it represents a significant waste of resources for the national economy, because our country is failing to use a large fraction of our human potential. For both of these reasons, I believe that those of us who are charged with making economic policy should do whatever we can to facilitate a faster rate of improvement in labor market conditions.\nPotential Usefulness of Monetary Policy\nI have shown you evidence that the labor market is currently weak. But the charts also show that the labor market has been weak for several years. Some observers have concluded from this persistence that monetary policy cannot ameliorate the problems in the labor market. One of my main points today is that this conclusion of monetary policy impotence is at odds with the behavior of inflation.\nTo understand this point, it’s useful to look at the behavior of personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation over the past few years. Just to be clear, this is a measure of inflation that incorporates the prices of all goods and services, including food and energy. Since the beginning of the Great Recession in December 2007, the PCE inflation rate has averaged around 1.5 percent. This is noticeably below the FOMC’s target inflation rate of 2 percent per year. And the outlook for future inflation is similarly subdued. Thus, earlier this year, the Congressional Budget Office projected that PCE inflation will remain below the FOMC’s target of 2 percent until the year 2018.\nLarge chart\nThese low levels of inflation tell us that monetary policy can be useful in increasing the rate of improvement in the labor market. Here’s what I mean. At a basic level, monetary stimulus increases the demand for goods among households and firms. This higher demand for goods tends to push upward on both prices and employment. Hence, the downside with using monetary policy to stimulate employment is that, when employment is near its maximum level, further stimulus can lead to unduly high inflation. But the data show that over the past few years inflation has been below the FOMC’s target of 2 percent. It’s expected to remain below desirable levels for years to come. These low levels of inflation show that the FOMC has a lot of room to provide much needed stimulus to the labor market.\nLearning from 1979\nI have argued that there is monetary policy capacity to ameliorate the severe weakness in U.S. labor market conditions. I next turn to the question of how best to use that capacity. In answering this question, I believe that it is useful to consider how the Federal Open Market Committee successfully solved the problem of high inflation back in the early 1980s.\nEarlier, I referred to a speech given by Paul Volcker in October 1979, early in his term as Chairman of the FOMC. At that time, the annual inflation rate was over 9 percent, after rising throughout the prior 15 years. Many observers felt that monetary policy was powerless to roll back (or possibly even to stem) this steady increase. As Chairman Volcker noted in his speech, “Some would argue that inflation is so bound up with … deep-seated forces that monetary and fiscal policies are impotent,” and that “we face impossible choices between inflation and prosperity.”2 Indeed, only 10 days before Chairman Volcker spoke, former Federal Reserve Chairman Arthur Burns had given a speech of his own in which he argued that the increase in inflation was grounded in “philosophic and political currents that have been transforming economic life in the United States … since the 1930s.”3\nThe perception that monetary policymakers could not (or would not) address the problem of high inflation was actually a key part of the problem facing the FOMC in 1979. If the public believes that it is impossible to reduce inflation, then the public will expect high inflation to persist or even to increase. Those high inflation expectations themselves generate high inflation. After all, if businesses expect high inflation, they will raise their prices more. And, if workers expect high inflation, they will ask for higher wage increases. In this way, the perception of monetary policy impotence in 1979 was itself a key force in generating higher inflation.\nFaced with this challenging issue, the FOMC followed what I would term goal-oriented monetary policy. This approach had two parts. First, the Committee formulated and communicated a clear goal: It intended to bring inflation down as quickly as possible. Second, on an ongoing basis, the Committee did whatever it took to achieve that goal, even if those actions had short-term economic costs. In particular, the Committee maintained tight monetary policy so as to push down inflation, even as interest rates and the unemployment rate soared to post-World War II highs. By following a goal-oriented policy, the FOMC was successful in bringing down both inflation and inflation expectations. Indeed, as early as late 1983, inflation had fallen below 4 percent.\nIn hindsight, I think that it is clear why the FOMC was so successful. With goal-oriented policy, communications and actions work together in a powerful fashion. Communications tell the public where the FOMC is taking the economy. Then, every subsequent action gives the public confidence that the Committee is willing and able to take the economy in that direction. Actions and communications operate together to destroy the dangerous perception of monetary policy ineffectiveness.\nGoal-Oriented Policy in 2013\nI’ve spent a lot of time talking about 1979, because I see three key parallels between the economic situation in 1979 and the economic situation in 2013. First, just like in 1979, the Federal Open Market Committee faces a challenging macroeconomic problem—although this time, the problem is stubbornly low employment as opposed to stubbornly high inflation. Second, there is a widespread perception that monetary policymakers lack either the tools or the will to solve this problem.\nAnd third, the perception of monetary policy ineffectiveness is itself a key factor in generating the problem. Let me elaborate on this last point. If the public thinks that monetary policy is ineffective, then it will expect relatively weak macroeconomic conditions in the future. But these expectations about the future have a direct impact on current macroeconomic outcomes. If households expect their incomes to be low in the future, they will save more and spend less today. If businesses expect low future demand for their products, they will invest less today and hire fewer people today. In this way, any perceptions of future FOMC ineffectiveness in generating favorable macroeconomic outcomes are hurting current employment.\nWe’ve seen how the FOMC dealt with its problems in 1979 by adopting a goal-oriented approach to monetary policy. Given the parallels between 1979 and 2013, I believe that a goal-oriented approach would be useful again. In 1979, the FOMC’s goal was to return inflation to low levels as rapidly as it could. In 2013, the FOMC’s goal should be to return employment to its maximal level as rapidly as it can, while still keeping inflation close to, although possibly temporarily above, the target of 2 percent. Note that, by keeping inflation expectations well-anchored, the inflation requirement ensures that monetary policy remains effective as a form of employment stimulus.\nBut, as Paul Volcker said in his 1979 speech, it is not enough to formulate or communicate a goal. The Committee has to stick to its formulated approach—that is, it must do whatever it takes to achieve its communicated goal. In the early 1980s, doing whatever it took meant being willing to keep money tight, even though interest rates and the unemployment rate rose to unusual heights. By doing whatever it took to achieve its goal, despite these short-term costs, the FOMC was able to bring down inflation and inflation expectations.\nDoing whatever it takes in the next few years will mean something different. It will mean that the FOMC is willing to continue to use the unconventional monetary policy tools that it has employed in the past few years. Indeed, it will mean that the FOMC is willing to use any of its congressionally authorized tools to achieve the goal of higher employment, no matter how unconventional those tools might be. Moreover, doing whatever it takes will mean keeping a historically unusual amount of monetary stimulus in place—and possibly providing more stimulus—even as:\nInterest rates remain near historic lows.\nEconomic growth rises above historical averages.\nPer capita employment begins to rise appreciably.\nAsset prices rise to unusually high levels, leading to concerns about “bubbles.”\nThe medium-term inflation outlook rises temporarily above 2 percent.\nIt may not be easy to stick to this path. But I anticipate that the benefits of doing so, in terms of employment gains, will be significant.\nI have been emphasizing the similarities between the FOMC’s situation in 1979 and its situation in 2013. But I should also emphasize one critical difference between the two situations. In 1979, the FOMC was faced with what proved to be a very painful trade-off between keeping inflation low and keeping employment high. In 2013, there is no such trade-off. As I showed you earlier, the impact of the Great Recession has left both prices and employment too low. Thus, the goal-oriented policy that I’ve described should also help the FOMC do better with respect to its objective of keeping inflation close to 2 percent.\nCommunication Changes and Policy Choices\nI’ll close by drawing some connections between the current monetary policy debate and the goal-oriented approach to monetary policy that I’ve described in this speech.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee is currently buying $85 billion of long-term assets per month. Recently, there has been an ongoing public conversation about the possibility that the FOMC might reduce its current flow of long-term asset purchases over the next year. The FOMC’s asset purchases push down long-term interest rates, and encourage consumers to spend and businesses to invest. Hence, reducing the flow of purchases in the near term would be a drag on the already slow rate of progress of the economy toward the Committee’s goals. From the perspective of a goal-oriented approach, the timing of this conversation seems puzzling.\nI find that the FOMC’s statement, released after its recent meeting, provides a useful way to understand this otherwise puzzling conversation. Long-term asset purchases are still a relatively novel tool, and central banks continue to learn about their costs and benefits. For this reason, the FOMC statement emphasizes that its decisions about asset purchases are based not only on the Committee’s economic outlook, but also on its assessment of the costs and efficacy of this unconventional policy tool. The requisite calculus is necessarily a delicate one.\nUnfortunately, the recent public conversation about reducing the flow of asset purchases typically places little or no emphasis on these costs and efficacy considerations. As a result, the dialogue risks creating the perception that the Committee is not following a goal-oriented approach to monetary policy. Such a perception can create doubts and uncertainty about the criteria underlying Committee decisions. We can see the imprint of those doubts and uncertainty in the heightened level of bond market volatility over the past few months. I believe that the Committee could reduce this volatility by greatly enhancing its communication on the role of cost and efficacy considerations in its deliberations about the evolution of asset purchases.\nThe Committee could also promote a goal-oriented approach to monetary policy by making other changes to its communication. The Committee has said little about how it plans to adjust the fed funds rate—the short-term interbank lending rate—once the unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent. In previous speeches, I’ve recommended that the FOMC announce its intention to keep the fed funds rate extraordinarily low at least until the unemployment rate falls below 5.5 percent, as long as the one-to-two-year-ahead outlook for the inflation rate stays below 2.5 percent. A recent working paper by senior Board of Governors staff suggests that this policy stance could indeed have material benefits in terms of the evolution of prices and employment.4\nBeyond these changes in communication, the Committee could also take concrete policy steps to demonstrate commitment to a goal-oriented approach to policy. In its most recent statement, the Committee says that it expects the unemployment rate to decline gradually and the inflation rate to be below 2 percent over the medium term. Under a goal-oriented approach, the Committee would respond to this weak outlook by providing more monetary stimulus—for example, by lowering the interest rate being paid to banks on their excess reserves.\nConclusions\nMy speech is called “A Time of Testing.”\nFive years ago, as the nation and the world spiraled into a financial crisis, it was obvious that economic policymakers faced a time of testing. Thanks in large part to Chairman Bernanke’s strong and imaginative leadership, the Federal Reserve System was able to pass that challenging test. The System’s actions in the fall of 2008 and the first half of 2009 were critical in eliminating what was the nontrivial risk of a second Great Depression, with unemployment rates closer to 25 percent than to 10 percent.\nMy message today is that this is another time of testing. Over six years after the national unemployment rate first began its ascent, the labor market remains disturbingly weak. The good news is that, with low inflation, the FOMC has considerable monetary policy capacity at its disposal with which to address this problem.\nThe FOMC’s test today is to figure out how best to deploy this capacity. The answer lies in taking two steps. The first step is to communicate that our goal is to accomplish a fast return to maximal employment while keeping inflation close to, although possibly temporarily above, the target of 2 percent. The second step is to do whatever it takes, on an ongoing basis, to achieve that goal. A goal-oriented approach to monetary policy greatly reduced inflation in the early 1980s. Adopting such an approach in our own time would improve labor market outcomes.\nThank you. I look forward to taking your questions.\nNote\n* This speech closely tracks speeches delivered on Sept. 26, Oct. 4 and Oct. 17, 2013, with the exception of some new material on pages 7 and 8.

I would also like to thank those of you who met with me earlier this morning for a discussion about business prospects and the choices that many of you are facing. As I often note, those types of discussions are important in helping to frame my understanding of the state of the economy. As you will hear in a moment, expectations are key to monetary policymaking, and understanding what informs the expectations of those who must make hiring and pricing decisions is very useful.\n\nThe title of my speech today is “A Time of Testing.” Paul Volcker, then Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, used the same title for a speech that he gave on October 9, 1979. Chairman Volcker intended his title to underscore that monetary policymakers in 1979 were confronted with a severe test in the form of high inflation and high inflation expectations. I use the title today to underscore that monetary policymakers in 2013 are again confronted with a severe test—but this time a test created by low employment and low employment expectations. Back in 1979, Chairman Volcker said that “this is a time of testing—a testing not only of our capacity collectively to reach coherent and intelligent policies, but to stick with them”1 [italics mine]. My theme today is that his powerful phrase applies with equal force to our current situation.\n\nLet me give you a brief roadmap of where I plan to take you today.\n\nFirst, I will show you data that depict the painfully slow pace of recovery in the U.S. labor market. Second, I will show you data that demonstrate that there is considerable monetary policy capacity with which to address this problem. Third, I will take you back to 1979 and describe the nature of the problem that monetary policymakers faced then. I will describe how they dealt with those problems by using what I would call goal-oriented monetary policy. Fourth, I will argue that there are several key parallels between 1979 and 2013. Given those parallels, monetary policymakers can best deal with the current labor market problems by also adopting a goal-oriented approach to monetary policy. Unlike 1979, though, the goal-oriented approach to monetary policy will focus on improving labor market outcomes, as opposed to lowering inflation. Finally, I’ll draw some connections between a goal-oriented approach to monetary policy and the current public conversation about monetary policy. Throughout my remarks, I’ll be making reference to the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC for short. The Committee currently consists of the six governors of the Federal Reserve System and the 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve Banks, including me. Its job is to set monetary policy for the United States.\n\nAs you listen to me today, please keep in mind that my views are not necessarily those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System, including other Federal Open Market Committee participants.\n\nI will begin by documenting the disturbing state of the labor market. I’ll start by showing you data on the evolution of the unemployment rate. In March 2007, the unemployment rate was 4.4 percent. It rose slowly throughout 2007 to reach 5.0 percent by the end of the year. The National Bureau of Economic Research dates the Great Recession as having begun in that month. In the wake of the recession, the unemployment rate reached a peak of 10 percent in October 2009.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nSince that date—four years ago!—the unemployment rate has fallen slowly to 7.3 percent. This is still unusually high relative to the past quarter century or so: Between 1986 and 2007, the unemployment rate was only higher than 7.3 percent in 1992. The current unemployment rate is also high relative to most forecasts of its expected long-run level, including those made by the FOMC. Basically, an unemployment rate of 7.3 percent means that the U.S. labor market is far from healthy.\n\nBut I would say that this measure—troubling as it is—overstates the improvement in the U.S. labor market. To estimate the unemployment rate, the Census Bureau asks people two questions: Are you working? And, if not, have you looked for work in the past four weeks? The unemployment rate measures the ratio of the second number—the recent job searchers—to the sum of the two numbers (the recent job searchers and the workers). This means that the unemployment rate can decline for two reasons: because more people are finding work or because fewer people are choosing not to look for work. Most of the declines in the unemployment rate since October 2009 have occurred because the fraction of people who are choosing to look for work has fallen.\n\nThis characterization is borne out if we look at the evolution of the fraction of people over the age of 16 who have a job—what’s called the employment-to-population ratio. In March 2007, the employment-to-population ratio was over 63 percent. The employment-to-population ratio fell sharply during the Great Recession and bottomed out at just over 58 percent in mid-2011. The percentage has risen little from this low point and remains lower than at any time between 1986 and 2007.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nIt is true that, even without the Great Recession, demographic forces would have led to some decline in the employment-to-population ratio since 2007. As the baby boom birth cohort—born between 1946 and 1964—ages, the fraction of retirees in the population grows steadily. But these demographic forces are simply too small to account for much of the decline in the employment-to-population ratio that I’ve described. One way to see this—but not the only way—is to focus on people who are outside the normal retirement age. Here, I’ve plotted the fraction of the population aged 25 to 54 who have a job. This ratio has improved somewhat more from its low point, but also remains lower than at any time between 1986 and 2007.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nTo summarize what we learn from the charts: The good news is that the labor market has improved since the end of the Great Recession. The bad news is that the rate of improvement over the past four years has been painfully slow. As a consequence, the condition of the labor market remains weak.\n\nThere are two aspects of the labor market situation that are worth emphasizing. First, the weak labor market represents considerable hardship for a large number of Americans, both in economic terms and in psychological terms. Second, it represents a significant waste of resources for the national economy, because our country is failing to use a large fraction of our human potential. For both of these reasons, I believe that those of us who are charged with making economic policy should do whatever we can to facilitate a faster rate of improvement in labor market conditions.\n\nI have shown you evidence that the labor market is currently weak. But the charts also show that the labor market has been weak for several years. Some observers have concluded from this persistence that monetary policy cannot ameliorate the problems in the labor market. One of my main points today is that this conclusion of monetary policy impotence is at odds with the behavior of inflation.\n\nTo understand this point, it’s useful to look at the behavior of personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation over the past few years. Just to be clear, this is a measure of inflation that incorporates the prices of all goods and services, including food and energy. Since the beginning of the Great Recession in December 2007, the PCE inflation rate has averaged around 1.5 percent. This is noticeably below the FOMC’s target inflation rate of 2 percent per year. And the outlook for future inflation is similarly subdued. Thus, earlier this year, the Congressional Budget Office projected that PCE inflation will remain below the FOMC’s target of 2 percent until the year 2018.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nThese low levels of inflation tell us that monetary policy can be useful in increasing the rate of improvement in the labor market. Here’s what I mean. At a basic level, monetary stimulus increases the demand for goods among households and firms. This higher demand for goods tends to push upward on both prices and employment. Hence, the downside with using monetary policy to stimulate employment is that, when employment is near its maximum level, further stimulus can lead to unduly high inflation. But the data show that over the past few years inflation has been below the FOMC’s target of 2 percent. It’s expected to remain below desirable levels for years to come. These low levels of inflation show that the FOMC has a lot of room to provide much needed stimulus to the labor market.\n\nI have argued that there is monetary policy capacity to ameliorate the severe weakness in U.S. labor market conditions. I next turn to the question of how best to use that capacity. In answering this question, I believe that it is useful to consider how the Federal Open Market Committee successfully solved the problem of high inflation back in the early 1980s.\n\nEarlier, I referred to a speech given by Paul Volcker in October 1979, early in his term as Chairman of the FOMC. At that time, the annual inflation rate was over 9 percent, after rising throughout the prior 15 years. Many observers felt that monetary policy was powerless to roll back (or possibly even to stem) this steady increase. As Chairman Volcker noted in his speech, “Some would argue that inflation is so bound up with … deep-seated forces that monetary and fiscal policies are impotent,” and that “we face impossible choices between inflation and prosperity.”2 Indeed, only 10 days before Chairman Volcker spoke, former Federal Reserve Chairman Arthur Burns had given a speech of his own in which he argued that the increase in inflation was grounded in “philosophic and political currents that have been transforming economic life in the United States … since the 1930s.”3\n\nThe perception that monetary policymakers could not (or would not) address the problem of high inflation was actually a key part of the problem facing the FOMC in 1979. If the public believes that it is impossible to reduce inflation, then the public will expect high inflation to persist or even to increase. Those high inflation expectations themselves generate high inflation. After all, if businesses expect high inflation, they will raise their prices more. And, if workers expect high inflation, they will ask for higher wage increases. In this way, the perception of monetary policy impotence in 1979 was itself a key force in generating higher inflation.\n\nFaced with this challenging issue, the FOMC followed what I would term goal-oriented monetary policy. This approach had two parts. First, the Committee formulated and communicated a clear goal: It intended to bring inflation down as quickly as possible. Second, on an ongoing basis, the Committee did whatever it took to achieve that goal, even if those actions had short-term economic costs. In particular, the Committee maintained tight monetary policy so as to push down inflation, even as interest rates and the unemployment rate soared to post-World War II highs. By following a goal-oriented policy, the FOMC was successful in bringing down both inflation and inflation expectations. Indeed, as early as late 1983, inflation had fallen below 4 percent.\n\nIn hindsight, I think that it is clear why the FOMC was so successful. With goal-oriented policy, communications and actions work together in a powerful fashion. Communications tell the public where the FOMC is taking the economy. Then, every subsequent action gives the public confidence that the Committee is willing and able to take the economy in that direction. Actions and communications operate together to destroy the dangerous perception of monetary policy ineffectiveness.\n\nI’ve spent a lot of time talking about 1979, because I see three key parallels between the economic situation in 1979 and the economic situation in 2013. First, just like in 1979, the Federal Open Market Committee faces a challenging macroeconomic problem—although this time, the problem is stubbornly low employment as opposed to stubbornly high inflation. Second, there is a widespread perception that monetary policymakers lack either the tools or the will to solve this problem.\n\nAnd third, the perception of monetary policy ineffectiveness is itself a key factor in generating the problem. Let me elaborate on this last point. If the public thinks that monetary policy is ineffective, then it will expect relatively weak macroeconomic conditions in the future. But these expectations about the future have a direct impact on current macroeconomic outcomes. If households expect their incomes to be low in the future, they will save more and spend less today. If businesses expect low future demand for their products, they will invest less today and hire fewer people today. In this way, any perceptions of future FOMC ineffectiveness in generating favorable macroeconomic outcomes are hurting current employment.\n\nWe’ve seen how the FOMC dealt with its problems in 1979 by adopting a goal-oriented approach to monetary policy. Given the parallels between 1979 and 2013, I believe that a goal-oriented approach would be useful again. In 1979, the FOMC’s goal was to return inflation to low levels as rapidly as it could. In 2013, the FOMC’s goal should be to return employment to its maximal level as rapidly as it can, while still keeping inflation close to, although possibly temporarily above, the target of 2 percent. Note that, by keeping inflation expectations well-anchored, the inflation requirement ensures that monetary policy remains effective as a form of employment stimulus.\n\nBut, as Paul Volcker said in his 1979 speech, it is not enough to formulate or communicate a goal. The Committee has to stick to its formulated approach—that is, it must do whatever it takes to achieve its communicated goal. In the early 1980s, doing whatever it took meant being willing to keep money tight, even though interest rates and the unemployment rate rose to unusual heights. By doing whatever it took to achieve its goal, despite these short-term costs, the FOMC was able to bring down inflation and inflation expectations.\n\nDoing whatever it takes in the next few years will mean something different. It will mean that the FOMC is willing to continue to use the unconventional monetary policy tools that it has employed in the past few years. Indeed, it will mean that the FOMC is willing to use any of its congressionally authorized tools to achieve the goal of higher employment, no matter how unconventional those tools might be. Moreover, doing whatever it takes will mean keeping a historically unusual amount of monetary stimulus in place—and possibly providing more stimulus—even as:\n\nIt may not be easy to stick to this path. But I anticipate that the benefits of doing so, in terms of employment gains, will be significant.\n\nI have been emphasizing the similarities between the FOMC’s situation in 1979 and its situation in 2013. But I should also emphasize one critical difference between the two situations. In 1979, the FOMC was faced with what proved to be a very painful trade-off between keeping inflation low and keeping employment high. In 2013, there is no such trade-off. As I showed you earlier, the impact of the Great Recession has left both prices and employment too low. Thus, the goal-oriented policy that I’ve described should also help the FOMC do better with respect to its objective of keeping inflation close to 2 percent.\n\nI’ll close by drawing some connections between the current monetary policy debate and the goal-oriented approach to monetary policy that I’ve described in this speech.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee is currently buying $85 billion of long-term assets per month. Recently, there has been an ongoing public conversation about the possibility that the FOMC might reduce its current flow of long-term asset purchases over the next year. The FOMC’s asset purchases push down long-term interest rates, and encourage consumers to spend and businesses to invest. Hence, reducing the flow of purchases in the near term would be a drag on the already slow rate of progress of the economy toward the Committee’s goals. From the perspective of a goal-oriented approach, the timing of this conversation seems puzzling.\n\nI find that the FOMC’s statement, released after its recent meeting, provides a useful way to understand this otherwise puzzling conversation. Long-term asset purchases are still a relatively novel tool, and central banks continue to learn about their costs and benefits. For this reason, the FOMC statement emphasizes that its decisions about asset purchases are based not only on the Committee’s economic outlook, but also on its assessment of the costs and efficacy of this unconventional policy tool. The requisite calculus is necessarily a delicate one.\n\nUnfortunately, the recent public conversation about reducing the flow of asset purchases typically places little or no emphasis on these costs and efficacy considerations. As a result, the dialogue risks creating the perception that the Committee is not following a goal-oriented approach to monetary policy. Such a perception can create doubts and uncertainty about the criteria underlying Committee decisions. We can see the imprint of those doubts and uncertainty in the heightened level of bond market volatility over the past few months. I believe that the Committee could reduce this volatility by greatly enhancing its communication on the role of cost and efficacy considerations in its deliberations about the evolution of asset purchases.\n\nThe Committee could also promote a goal-oriented approach to monetary policy by making other changes to its communication. The Committee has said little about how it plans to adjust the fed funds rate—the short-term interbank lending rate—once the unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent. In previous speeches, I’ve recommended that the FOMC announce its intention to keep the fed funds rate extraordinarily low at least until the unemployment rate falls below 5.5 percent, as long as the one-to-two-year-ahead outlook for the inflation rate stays below 2.5 percent. A recent working paper by senior Board of Governors staff suggests that this policy stance could indeed have material benefits in terms of the evolution of prices and employment.4\n\nBeyond these changes in communication, the Committee could also take concrete policy steps to demonstrate commitment to a goal-oriented approach to policy. In its most recent statement, the Committee says that it expects the unemployment rate to decline gradually and the inflation rate to be below 2 percent over the medium term. Under a goal-oriented approach, the Committee would respond to this weak outlook by providing more monetary stimulus—for example, by lowering the interest rate being paid to banks on their excess reserves.\n\nMy speech is called “A Time of Testing.”\n\nFive years ago, as the nation and the world spiraled into a financial crisis, it was obvious that economic policymakers faced a time of testing. Thanks in large part to Chairman Bernanke’s strong and imaginative leadership, the Federal Reserve System was able to pass that challenging test. The System’s actions in the fall of 2008 and the first half of 2009 were critical in eliminating what was the nontrivial risk of a second Great Depression, with unemployment rates closer to 25 percent than to 10 percent.\n\nMy message today is that this is another time of testing. Over six years after the national unemployment rate first began its ascent, the labor market remains disturbingly weak. The good news is that, with low inflation, the FOMC has considerable monetary policy capacity at its disposal with which to address this problem.\n\nThe FOMC’s test today is to figure out how best to deploy this capacity. The answer lies in taking two steps. The first step is to communicate that our goal is to accomplish a fast return to maximal employment while keeping inflation close to, although possibly temporarily above, the target of 2 percent. The second step is to do whatever it takes, on an ongoing basis, to achieve that goal. A goal-oriented approach to monetary policy greatly reduced inflation in the early 1980s. Adopting such an approach in our own time would improve labor market outcomes.\n\nThank you.

To give away my punch line right away: The Federal Reserve’s community development function is grounded in a long tradition of fostering and building collaboration. For a variety of reasons, I see this culture of networking as being especially useful in the endeavor of promoting healthy communities. My remarks today represent my own views and are not necessarily those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Minneapolis Fed’s community development activities help support the economic growth of low- and moderate-income communities in the region we serve. However, we do not work directly with these communities. Instead, the Bank, as an intermediary, works in partnership with other organizations to further its goals. Traditionally, our partners have included community development organizations, financial institutions and government agencies that support economic growth, small business development and neighborhood stabilization. And, when the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation reached out to the Federal Reserve System in 2010 to address some of the health challenges that low- and moderate-income communities face, we became acquainted with an entire field of promising new partners: those who work in health and human services.\nIn this way, the Federal Reserve’s community development function is all about networking, collaboration and partnership-building. I see this tradition as one that will make us especially effective in the promotion of healthy communities. As you all know, there are many factors that correlate with individual health outcomes—factors such as education, employment, housing, transportation and financial access. Because these factors are inextricably linked, successful promotion of health requires comprehensive solutions. And we can only arrive at these comprehensive solutions by working together across sectors.\nIt is easy to come up with concrete examples of how the Minneapolis Fed’s community development function is helping to fill this need. Most prominently, as Paul mentioned in his opening remarks, we held a conference last year to promote greater collaboration between community development and health practitioners. In the year since our conference, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis has continued to engage community leaders across the Ninth District in conversations that highlight the need for cross-sector engagement. Let me give two examples of that engagement.\nDuring a recent visit to La Crosse, Wisconsin, Minneapolis Fed Community Development staff convened a group of nonprofit and local government leaders to discuss anticipated impacts of the Affordable Care Act. While the new health care legislation was viewed as a positive step toward increasing access to care for low-income households, several organizations expressed concern about the increased costs associated with record-keeping, the need to reduce staff hours and the assumed difficulty of retaining part-time employees without employer health benefits. Community leaders agreed that a greater exchange of information between the health sector and other sectors was needed in order to make informed decisions about organizational operations and to ensure a smooth transition.\nOur Community Development staff also recently traveled to Helena, Montana, to learn more about the obstacles limiting access to nutritional foods across the state.\nIn Helena, at a meeting facilitated by the Minneapolis Fed, business, education, local government and nonprofit leaders discussed the challenges that food suppliers face, which included high fuel and transportation costs, limited storage facilities and inadequate food-processing infrastructure. Community leaders identified potential solutions to address these issues, but agreed that greater collaboration across sectors was needed in order to implement them.\nSo, there is a need for cross-sector solutions.\nArriving at those solutions will take increased communication among practitioners working on the ground—across sectors, across geographies and even across agencies. As you listen to the insights of your colleagues in the room today, I encourage you to contemplate new and unconventional opportunities to build relationships and to share information. Listen not only for those options to assist and build your own projects, but also for those opportunities where your experience can help another community as well. Let me be clear, though: I applaud you for your collaborative efforts to date. I am delighted, too, that the members of the Minneapolis Fed’s community development function have been able to play such a key role in fostering this collaboration. Delighted—but not surprised. After all, as I described earlier, collaboration is really the essence of the Fed’s community development culture. I know that I speak for Dorothy, Ela and the rest of our group when I say that we very much look forward to leveraging our culture in helping you build the kinds of partnerships and collaboration that we will need in order to better promote healthy communities.\nThank you for your attention, and good luck with the rest of your day.\n\nThank you, Paul, for the introduction.\n\nMy remarks today will be about what the Federal Reserve brings to the table in terms of promoting healthy communities.

Earlier, you heard from Paul Drake about our meeting this morning with the Helena Branch board of directors, and also about a meeting with a number of former board members. Let me just reinforce what Paul described: The service of these board members, past and present, as well as others who have served on Federal Reserve advisory councils, are a key part of this nation’s decentralized central bank system. The Federal Reserve System is made up of district banks and branches to ensure local input into national policymaking. The information we receive from those directors and council members is critical in shaping our understanding of the economy. So I would like to take this opportunity to thank them for their public service.\nThe title of my speech today is “A Time of Testing.” Paul Volcker, then Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, used the same title for a speech that he gave on October 9, 1979. Chairman Volcker intended his title to underscore that monetary policymakers in 1979 were confronted with a severe test in the form of high inflation and high inflation expectations. I use the title today to underscore that monetary policymakers in 2013 are again confronted with a severe test—but this time a test created by low employment and low employment expectations. Back in 1979, Chairman Volcker said that “this is a time of testing—a testing not only of our capacity collectively to reach coherent and intelligent policies, but to stick with them”1 [italics mine]. My theme today is that his powerful phrase applies with equal force to our current situation.\nLet me give you a brief roadmap of where I plan to take you today.\nFirst, I will show you data that depict the painfully slow pace of recovery in the U.S. labor market. Second, I will show you data that demonstrate that there is considerable monetary policy capacity with which to address this problem. Third, I will take you back to 1979 and describe the nature of the problem that monetary policymakers faced then. I will describe how they dealt with those problems by using what I would call goal-oriented monetary policy. Fourth, I will argue that there are several key parallels between 1979 and 2013. Given those parallels, monetary policymakers can best deal with the current labor market problems by also adopting a goal-oriented approach to monetary policy. Unlike 1979, though, the goal-oriented approach to monetary policy will focus on improving labor market outcomes, as opposed to lowering inflation.\nThroughout my remarks, I’ll be making reference to the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC for short. The Committee currently consists of the six governors of the Federal Reserve System and the 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve Banks, including me. Its job is to set monetary policy for the United States.\nAs you listen to me today, please keep in mind that my views are not necessarily those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System, including other Federal Open Market Committee participants.\nEvolution of Labor Market Outcomes since 2007\nI will begin by documenting the disturbing state of the labor market. I’ll start by showing you data on the evolution of the unemployment rate. In March 2007, the unemployment rate was 4.4 percent. It rose slowly throughout 2007 to reach 5.0 percent by the end of the year. The National Bureau of Economic Research dates the Great Recession as having begun in that month. In the wake of the recession, the unemployment rate reached a peak of 10 percent in October 2009.\nLarge chart\nSince that date—almost four years ago!—the unemployment rate has fallen slowly to 7.3 percent. This is still unusually high relative to the past quarter century or so: Between 1986 and 2007, the unemployment rate was only higher than 7.3 percent in 1992. The current unemployment rate is also high relative to most forecasts of its expected long-run level, including those made by the FOMC. Basically, an unemployment rate of 7.3 percent means that the U.S. labor market is far from healthy.\nBut I would say that this measure—troubling as it is—overstates the improvement in the U.S. labor market. To estimate the unemployment rate, the Census Bureau asks people two questions: Are you working? And, if not, have you looked for work in the past four weeks? The unemployment rate measures the ratio of the second number—the recent job searchers—to the sum of the two numbers (the recent job searchers and the workers). This means that the unemployment rate can decline for two reasons: because more people are finding work or because fewer people are choosing not to look for work. Most of the declines in the unemployment rate since October 2009 have occurred because the fraction of people who are choosing to look for work has fallen.\nThis characterization is borne out if we look at the evolution of the fraction of people over the age of 16 who have a job—what’s called the employment-to-population ratio. In March 2007, the employment-to-population ratio was over 63 percent. The employment-to-population ratio fell sharply during the Great Recession and bottomed out at just over 58 percent in mid-2011. The percentage has risen little from this low point and remains lower than at any time between 1986 and 2007.\nLarge chart\nIt is true that, even without the Great Recession, demographic forces would have led to some decline in the employment-to-population ratio since 2007. As the baby boom birth cohort—born between 1946 and 1964—ages, the fraction of retirees in the population grows steadily. But these demographic forces are simply too small to account for much of the decline in the employment-to-population ratio that I’ve described. One way to see this—but not the only way—is to focus on people who are outside the normal retirement age. Here, I’ve plotted the fraction of the population aged 25 to 54 who have a job. This ratio has improved somewhat more from its low point, but also remains lower than at any time between 1986 and 2007.\nLarge chart\nTo summarize what we learn from the charts: The good news is that the labor market has improved since the end of the Great Recession. The bad news is that the rate of improvement over the past four years has been painfully slow. As a consequence, the condition of the labor market remains weak.\nThere are two aspects of the labor market situation that are worth emphasizing. First, the weak labor market represents considerable hardship for a large number of Americans, both in economic terms and in psychological terms. Second, it represents a significant waste of resources for the national economy, because our country is failing to use a large fraction of our human potential. For both of these reasons, I believe that those of us who are charged with making economic policy should do whatever we can to facilitate a faster rate of improvement in labor market conditions.\nPotential Usefulness of Monetary Policy\nI have shown you evidence that the labor market is currently weak. But the charts also show that the labor market has been weak for several years. Some observers have concluded from this persistence that monetary policy cannot ameliorate the problems in the labor market. One of my main points today is that this conclusion of monetary policy impotence is at odds with the behavior of inflation.\nTo understand this point, it’s useful to look at the behavior of personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation over the past few years. Just to be clear, this is a measure of inflation that incorporates the prices of all goods and services, including food and energy. Since the beginning of the Great Recession in December 2007, the PCE inflation rate has averaged around 1.5 percent. This is noticeably below the FOMC’s target inflation rate of 2 percent per year. And the outlook for future inflation is similarly subdued. Thus, earlier this year, the Congressional Budget Office projected that PCE inflation will remain below the FOMC’s target of 2 percent until the year 2018.\nLarge chart\nThese low levels of inflation tell us that monetary policy can be useful in increasing the rate of improvement in the labor market. Here’s what I mean. At a basic level, monetary stimulus increases the demand for goods among households and firms. This higher demand for goods tends to push upward on both prices and employment. Hence, the downside with using monetary policy to stimulate employment is that, when employment is near its maximum level, further stimulus can lead to unduly high inflation. But the data show that over the past few years inflation has been below the FOMC’s target of 2 percent. It’s expected to remain below desirable levels for years to come. These low levels of inflation show that the FOMC has a lot of room to provide much needed stimulus to the labor market.\nLearning from 1979\nI have argued that there is monetary policy capacity to ameliorate the severe weakness in U.S. labor market conditions. I next turn to the question of how best to use that capacity. In answering this question, I believe that it is useful to consider how the Federal Open Market Committee successfully solved the problem of high inflation back in the early 1980s.\nEarlier, I referred to a speech given by Paul Volcker in October 1979, early in his term as Chairman of the FOMC. At that time, the annual inflation rate was over 9 percent, after rising throughout the prior 15 years. Many observers felt that monetary policy was powerless to roll back (or possibly even to stem) this steady increase. As Chairman Volcker noted in his speech, “Some would argue that inflation is so bound up with ... deep-seated forces that monetary and fiscal policies are impotent,” and that “we face impossible choices between inflation and prosperity.”2 Indeed, only 10 days before Chairman Volcker spoke, former Federal Reserve Chairman Arthur Burns had given a speech of his own in which he argued that the increase in inflation was grounded in “philosophic and political currents that have been transforming economic life in the United States ... since the 1930s.”3\nThe perception that monetary policymakers could not (or would not) address the problem of high inflation was actually a key part of the problem facing the FOMC in 1979. If the public believes that it is impossible to reduce inflation, then the public will expect high inflation to persist or even to increase. Those high inflation expectations themselves generate high inflation. After all, if businesses expect high inflation, they will raise their prices more. And, if workers expect high inflation, they will ask for higher wage increases. In this way, the perception of monetary policy impotence in 1979 was itself a key force in generating higher inflation.\nFaced with this challenging issue, the FOMC followed what I would term goal-oriented monetary policy. This approach had two parts. First, the Committee formulated and communicated a clear goal: It intended to bring inflation down as quickly as possible. Second, on an ongoing basis, the Committee did whatever it took to achieve that goal, even if those actions had short-term economic costs. In particular, the Committee maintained tight monetary policy so as to push down inflation, even as interest rates and the unemployment rate soared to post-World War II highs. By following a goal-oriented policy, the FOMC was successful in bringing down both inflation and inflation expectations. Indeed, as early as late 1983, inflation had fallen below 4 percent.\nIn hindsight, I think that it is clear why the FOMC was so successful. With goal-oriented policy, communications and actions work together in a powerful fashion. Communications tell the public where the FOMC is taking the economy. Then, every subsequent action gives the public confidence that the Committee is willing and able to take the economy in that direction. Actions and communications operate together to destroy the dangerous perception of monetary policy ineffectiveness.\nGoal-Oriented Policy in 2013\nI’ve spent a lot of time talking about 1979, because I see three key parallels between the economic situation in 1979 and the economic situation in 2013. First, just like in 1979, the Federal Open Market Committee faces a challenging macroeconomic problem—although this time, the problem is stubbornly low employment as opposed to stubbornly high inflation. Second, there is a widespread perception that monetary policymakers lack either the tools or the will to solve this problem.\nAnd third, the perception of monetary policy ineffectiveness is itself a key factor in generating the problem. Let me elaborate on this last point. If the public thinks that monetary policy is ineffective, then it will expect relatively weak macroeconomic conditions in the future. But these expectations about the future have a direct impact on current macroeconomic outcomes. If households expect their incomes to be low in the future, they will save more and spend less today. If businesses expect low future demand for their products, they will invest less today and hire fewer people today. In this way, any perceptions of future FOMC ineffectiveness in generating favorable macroeconomic outcomes are hurting current employment.\nWe’ve seen how the FOMC dealt with its problems in 1979 by adopting a goal-oriented approach to monetary policy. Given the parallels between 1979 and 2013, I believe that a goal-oriented approach would be useful again. In 1979, the FOMC’s goal was to return inflation to low levels as rapidly as it could. In 2013, the FOMC’s goal should be to return employment to its maximal level as rapidly as it can, while still keeping inflation close to, although possibly temporarily above, the target of 2 percent. Note that, by keeping inflation expectations well-anchored, the inflation requirement ensures that monetary policy remains effective as a form of employment stimulus.\nBut, as Paul Volcker said in his 1979 speech, it is not enough to formulate or communicate a goal. The Committee has to stick to its formulated approach—that is, it must do whatever it takes to achieve its communicated goal. In the early 1980s, doing whatever it took meant being willing to keep money tight, even though interest rates and the unemployment rate rose to unusual heights. By doing whatever it took to achieve its goal, despite these short-term costs, the FOMC was able to bring down inflation and inflation expectations.\nDoing whatever it takes in the next few years will mean something different. It will mean that the FOMC is willing to continue to use the unconventional monetary policy tools that it has employed in the past few years. Indeed, it will mean that the FOMC is willing to use any of its congressionally authorized tools to achieve the goal of higher employment, no matter how unconventional those tools might be. Moreover, doing whatever it takes will mean keeping a historically unusual amount of monetary stimulus in place—and possibly providing more stimulus—even as:\nInterest rates remain near historic lows.\nEconomic growth rises above historical averages.\nPer capita employment begins to rise appreciably.\nAsset prices rise to unusually high levels, leading to concerns about “bubbles.”\nThe medium-term inflation outlook rises temporarily above 2 percent.\nIt may not be easy to stick to this path. But I anticipate that the benefits of doing so, in terms of employment gains, will be significant.\nI have been emphasizing the similarities between the FOMC’s situation in 1979 and its situation in 2013. But I should also emphasize one critical difference between the two situations. In 1979, the FOMC was faced with what proved to be a very painful trade-off between keeping inflation low and keeping employment high. In 2013, there is no such trade-off. As I showed you earlier, the impact of the Great Recession has left both prices and employment too low. Thus, the goal-oriented policy that I’ve described should also help the FOMC do better with respect to its objective of keeping inflation close to 2 percent.\nBefore I wrap up, I’ll note that the FOMC’s current policy strategy differs in important ways from the goal-oriented approach that I’m recommending today. In its most recent statement, the Committee says that appropriate monetary policy should lead the unemployment rate to decline gradually and lead the inflation rate to be below 2 percent over the medium term. Under a goal-oriented approach to policy, the FOMC would view a “gradual decline” in the unemployment rate as being undesirably slow, given that the medium-term outlook for inflation is so low. Hence, the Committee’s outlook would trigger a decision to provide more monetary stimulus.\nConclusions\nMy speech is called “A Time of Testing.”\nFive years ago, in September 2008, as the nation and the world spiraled into a financial crisis, it was obvious that economic policymakers faced a time of testing. Thanks in large part to Chairman Bernanke’s strong and imaginative leadership, the Federal Reserve System was able to pass that challenging test. The System’s actions in the fall of 2008 and the first half of 2009 were critical in eliminating what was the nontrivial risk of a second Great Depression, with unemployment rates closer to 25 percent than to 10 percent.\nMy message today is that September 2013 is another time of testing. Over six years after the national unemployment rate first began its ascent, the labor market remains disturbingly weak. The good news is that, with low inflation, the FOMC has considerable monetary policy capacity at its disposal with which to address this problem.\nThe FOMC’s test today is to figure out how best to deploy this capacity. The answer lies in taking two steps. The first step is to communicate that our goal is to accomplish a fast return to maximal employment while keeping inflation close to, although possibly temporarily above, the target of 2 percent. The second step is to do whatever it takes, on an ongoing basis, to achieve that goal. A goal-oriented approach to monetary policy greatly reduced inflation in the early 1980s. Adopting such an approach in our own time would improve labor market outcomes.\nThank you. I look forward to taking your questions.\nNote\n* Thanks to Ron Feldman, David Fettig, Terry Fitzgerald, Claire Hou, Sam Schulhofer-Wohl and Kei-Mu Yi for their assistance with these remarks and the supporting materials.\nEndnotes\n1 Volcker, Paul A. 1979. “A Time of Testing.” Remarks before the American Bankers Association, New Orleans, La., Oct. 9, p. 4.\n2 Volcker, p. 5.\n3 Burns, Arthur F. 1979. “The Anguish of Central Banking.” 1979 Per Jacobsson Lecture, Belgrade, Yugoslavia, Sept. 30, p. 9.\n\nNote*\n\nThank you for that generous introduction, Dave, and thanks to all of you for joining us here today. Earlier, you heard from Paul Drake about our meeting this morning with the Helena Branch board of directors, and also about a meeting with a number of former board members. Let me just reinforce what Paul described: The service of these board members, past and present, as well as others who have served on Federal Reserve advisory councils, are a key part of this nation’s decentralized central bank system. The Federal Reserve System is made up of district banks and branches to ensure local input into national policymaking. The information we receive from those directors and council members is critical in shaping our understanding of the economy. So I would like to take this opportunity to thank them for their public service.\n\nThe title of my speech today is “A Time of Testing.” Paul Volcker, then Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, used the same title for a speech that he gave on October 9, 1979. Chairman Volcker intended his title to underscore that monetary policymakers in 1979 were confronted with a severe test in the form of high inflation and high inflation expectations. I use the title today to underscore that monetary policymakers in 2013 are again confronted with a severe test—but this time a test created by low employment and low employment expectations. Back in 1979, Chairman Volcker said that “this is a time of testing—a testing not only of our capacity collectively to reach coherent and intelligent policies, but to stick with them”1 [italics mine]. My theme today is that his powerful phrase applies with equal force to our current situation.\n\nLet me give you a brief roadmap of where I plan to take you today.\n\nFirst, I will show you data that depict the painfully slow pace of recovery in the U.S. labor market. Second, I will show you data that demonstrate that there is considerable monetary policy capacity with which to address this problem. Third, I will take you back to 1979 and describe the nature of the problem that monetary policymakers faced then. I will describe how they dealt with those problems by using what I would call goal-oriented monetary policy. Fourth, I will argue that there are several key parallels between 1979 and 2013. Given those parallels, monetary policymakers can best deal with the current labor market problems by also adopting a goal-oriented approach to monetary policy. Unlike 1979, though, the goal-oriented approach to monetary policy will focus on improving labor market outcomes, as opposed to lowering inflation.\n\nThroughout my remarks, I’ll be making reference to the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC for short. The Committee currently consists of the six governors of the Federal Reserve System and the 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve Banks, including me. Its job is to set monetary policy for the United States.\n\nAs you listen to me today, please keep in mind that my views are not necessarily those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System, including other Federal Open Market Committee participants.\n\nI will begin by documenting the disturbing state of the labor market. I’ll start by showing you data on the evolution of the unemployment rate. In March 2007, the unemployment rate was 4.4 percent. It rose slowly throughout 2007 to reach 5.0 percent by the end of the year. The National Bureau of Economic Research dates the Great Recession as having begun in that month. In the wake of the recession, the unemployment rate reached a peak of 10 percent in October 2009.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nSince that date—almost four years ago!—the unemployment rate has fallen slowly to 7.3 percent. This is still unusually high relative to the past quarter century or so: Between 1986 and 2007, the unemployment rate was only higher than 7.3 percent in 1992. The current unemployment rate is also high relative to most forecasts of its expected long-run level, including those made by the FOMC. Basically, an unemployment rate of 7.3 percent means that the U.S. labor market is far from healthy.\n\nBut I would say that this measure—troubling as it is—overstates the improvement in the U.S. labor market. To estimate the unemployment rate, the Census Bureau asks people two questions: Are you working? And, if not, have you looked for work in the past four weeks? The unemployment rate measures the ratio of the second number—the recent job searchers—to the sum of the two numbers (the recent job searchers and the workers). This means that the unemployment rate can decline for two reasons: because more people are finding work or because fewer people are choosing not to look for work. Most of the declines in the unemployment rate since October 2009 have occurred because the fraction of people who are choosing to look for work has fallen.\n\nThis characterization is borne out if we look at the evolution of the fraction of people over the age of 16 who have a job—what’s called the employment-to-population ratio. In March 2007, the employment-to-population ratio was over 63 percent. The employment-to-population ratio fell sharply during the Great Recession and bottomed out at just over 58 percent in mid-2011. The percentage has risen little from this low point and remains lower than at any time between 1986 and 2007.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nIt is true that, even without the Great Recession, demographic forces would have led to some decline in the employment-to-population ratio since 2007. As the baby boom birth cohort—born between 1946 and 1964—ages, the fraction of retirees in the population grows steadily. But these demographic forces are simply too small to account for much of the decline in the employment-to-population ratio that I’ve described. One way to see this—but not the only way—is to focus on people who are outside the normal retirement age. Here, I’ve plotted the fraction of the population aged 25 to 54 who have a job. This ratio has improved somewhat more from its low point, but also remains lower than at any time between 1986 and 2007.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nTo summarize what we learn from the charts: The good news is that the labor market has improved since the end of the Great Recession. The bad news is that the rate of improvement over the past four years has been painfully slow. As a consequence, the condition of the labor market remains weak.\n\nThere are two aspects of the labor market situation that are worth emphasizing. First, the weak labor market represents considerable hardship for a large number of Americans, both in economic terms and in psychological terms. Second, it represents a significant waste of resources for the national economy, because our country is failing to use a large fraction of our human potential. For both of these reasons, I believe that those of us who are charged with making economic policy should do whatever we can to facilitate a faster rate of improvement in labor market conditions.\n\nI have shown you evidence that the labor market is currently weak. But the charts also show that the labor market has been weak for several years. Some observers have concluded from this persistence that monetary policy cannot ameliorate the problems in the labor market. One of my main points today is that this conclusion of monetary policy impotence is at odds with the behavior of inflation.\n\nTo understand this point, it’s useful to look at the behavior of personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation over the past few years.

I’ll start by showing you data on the evolution of the unemployment rate.\nLarge chart\nIn March 2007, the unemployment rate was 4.4 percent. It rose slowly throughout 2007 to reach 5.0 percent by the end of the year. The National Bureau of Economic Research dates the Great Recession as having begun in that month. In the wake of the recession, the unemployment rate reached a peak of 10 percent in October 2009.\nSince that date—almost four years ago!—the unemployment rate has fallen slowly to 7.3 percent.

Most of the declines in the unemployment rate since October 2009 have occurred because the fraction of people who are choosing to look for work has fallen.\nThis characterization is borne out if we look at the evolution of the fraction of people over the age of 16 who have a job—what’s called the employment-to-population ratio.\nLarge chart\nIn March 2007, the employment-to-population ratio was over 63 percent. The employment-to-population ratio fell sharply during the Great Recession and bottomed out at just over 58 percent in mid-2011. The percentage has risen little from this low point and remains lower than at any time between 1986 and 2007.\nIt is true that, even without the Great Recession, demographic forces would have led to some decline in the employment-to-population ratio since 2007. As the baby boom birth cohort—born between 1946 and 1964—ages, the fraction of retirees in the population grows steadily. But these demographic forces are simply too small to account for much of the decline in the employment-to-population ratio that I’ve described. One way to see this—but not the only way—is to focus on people who are outside the normal retirement age. Here, I’ve plotted the fraction of the population aged 25 to 54 who have a job. This ratio has improved somewhat more from its low point, but also remains lower than at any time between 1986 and 2007.\nLarge chart\nTo summarize what we learn from the charts: The good news is that the labor market has improved since the end of the Great Recession. The bad news is that the rate of improvement over the past four years has been painfully slow. As a consequence, the condition of the labor market remains weak.\nThere are two aspects of the labor market situation that are worth emphasizing. First, the weak labor market represents considerable hardship for a large number of Americans, both in economic terms and in psychological terms. Second, it represents a significant waste of resources for the national economy, because our country is failing to use a large fraction of our human potential. For both of these reasons, I believe that those of us who are charged with making economic policy should do whatever we can to facilitate a faster rate of improvement in labor market conditions.\nPotential Usefulness of Monetary Policy\nI have shown you evidence that the labor market is currently weak. But the charts also show that the labor market has been weak for several years. Some observers have concluded from this persistence that monetary policy cannot ameliorate the problems in the labor market. One of my main points today is that this conclusion of monetary policy impotence is at odds with the behavior of inflation.\nTo understand this point, it’s useful to look at the behavior of personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation over the past few years.\nLarge chart\nJust to be clear, this is a measure of inflation that incorporates the prices of all goods and services, including food and energy. Since the beginning of the Great Recession in December 2007, the PCE inflation rate has averaged around 1.5 percent. This is noticeably below the FOMC’s target inflation rate of 2 percent per year. And the outlook for future inflation is similarly subdued. Thus, earlier this year, the Congressional Budget Office projected that PCE inflation will remain below the FOMC’s target of 2 percent until the year 2018.\nThese low levels of inflation tell us that monetary policy can be useful in increasing the rate of improvement in the labor market. Here’s what I mean. At a basic level, monetary stimulus increases the demand for goods among households and firms. This higher demand for goods tends to push upward on both prices and employment. Hence, the downside with using monetary policy to stimulate employment is that, when employment is near its maximum level, further stimulus can lead to unduly high inflation. But the data show that over the past few years inflation has been below the FOMC’s target of 2 percent. It’s expected to remain below desirable levels for years to come. These low levels of inflation show that the FOMC has a lot of room to provide much needed stimulus to the labor market.\nLearning from 1979\nI have argued that there is monetary policy capacity to ameliorate the severe weakness in U.S. labor market conditions. I next turn to the question of how best to use that capacity. In answering this question, I believe that it is useful to consider how the Federal Open Market Committee successfully solved the problem of high inflation back in the early 1980s.\nEarlier, I referred to a speech given by Paul Volcker in October 1979, early in his term as Chairman of the FOMC. At that time, the annual inflation rate was over 9 percent, after rising throughout the prior 15 years. Many observers felt that monetary policy was powerless to roll back (or possibly even to stem) this steady increase. As Chairman Volcker noted in his speech, “Some would argue that inflation is so bound up with ... deep-seated forces that monetary and fiscal policies are impotent,” and that “we face impossible choices between inflation and prosperity.”2 Indeed, only 10 days before Chairman Volcker spoke, former Federal Reserve Chairman Arthur Burns had given a speech of his own in which he argued that the increase in inflation was grounded in “philosophic and political currents that have been transforming economic life in the United States … since the 1930s.”3\nThe perception that monetary policymakers could not (or would not) address the problem of high inflation was actually a key part of the problem facing the FOMC in 1979. If the public believes that it is impossible to reduce inflation, then the public will expect high inflation to persist or even to increase. Those high inflation expectations themselves generate high inflation. After all, if businesses expect high inflation, they will raise their prices more. And, if workers expect high inflation, they will ask for higher wage increases. In this way, the perception of monetary policy impotence in 1979 was itself a key force in generating higher inflation.\nFaced with this challenging issue, the FOMC followed what I would term goal-oriented monetary policy. This approach had two parts. First, the Committee formulated and communicated a clear goal: It intended to bring inflation down as quickly as possible. Second, on an ongoing basis, the Committee did whatever it took to achieve that goal, even if those actions had short-term economic costs. In particular, the Committee maintained tight monetary policy so as to push down inflation, even as interest rates and the unemployment rate soared to post-World War II highs. By following a goal-oriented policy, the FOMC was successful in bringing down both inflation and inflation expectations. Indeed, as early as late 1983, inflation had fallen below 4 percent.\nIn hindsight, I think that it is clear why the FOMC was so successful. With goal-oriented policy, communications and actions work together in a powerful fashion. Communications tell the public where the FOMC is taking the economy. Then, every subsequent action gives the public confidence that the Committee is willing and able to take the economy in that direction. Actions and communications operate together to destroy the dangerous perception of monetary policy ineffectiveness.\nGoal-Oriented Policy in 2013\nI’ve spent a lot of time talking about 1979, because I see three key parallels between the economic situation in 1979 and the economic situation in 2013. First, just like in 1979, the Federal Open Market Committee faces a challenging macroeconomic problem—although this time, the problem is stubbornly low employment as opposed to stubbornly high inflation. Second, there is a widespread perception that monetary policymakers lack either the tools or the will to solve this problem.\nAnd third, the perception of monetary policy ineffectiveness is itself a key factor in generating the problem. Let me elaborate on this last point. If the public thinks that monetary policy is ineffective, then it will expect relatively weak macroeconomic conditions in the future. But these expectations about the future have a direct impact on current macroeconomic outcomes. If households expect their incomes to be low in the future, they will save more and spend less today. If businesses expect low future demand for their products, they will invest less today and hire fewer people today. In this way, any perceptions of future FOMC ineffectiveness in generating favorable macroeconomic outcomes are hurting current employment.\nWe’ve seen how the FOMC dealt with its problems in 1979 by adopting a goal-oriented approach to monetary policy. Given the parallels between 1979 and 2013, I believe that a goal-oriented approach would be useful again. In 1979, the FOMC’s goal was to return inflation to low levels as rapidly as it could. In 2013, the FOMC’s goal should be to return employment to its maximal level as rapidly as it can, while still keeping inflation close to, although possibly temporarily above, the target of 2 percent. Note that, by keeping inflation expectations well-anchored, the inflation requirement ensures that monetary policy remains effective as a form of employment stimulus.\nBut, as Paul Volcker said in his 1979 speech, it is not enough to formulate or communicate a goal. The Committee has to stick to its formulated approach—that is, it must do whatever it takes to achieve its communicated goal. In the early 1980s, doing whatever it took meant being willing to keep money tight, even though interest rates and the unemployment rate rose to unusual heights. By doing whatever it took to achieve its goal, despite these short-term costs, the FOMC was able to bring down inflation and inflation expectations.\nDoing whatever it takes in the next few years will mean something different. It will mean that the FOMC is willing to continue to use the unconventional monetary policy tools that it has employed in the past few years. Indeed, it will mean that the FOMC is willing to use any of its congressionally authorized tools to achieve the goal of higher employment, no matter how unconventional those tools might be. Moreover, doing whatever it takes will mean keeping a historically unusual amount of monetary stimulus in place—and possibly providing more stimulus—even as:\nInterest rates remain near historic lows.\nEconomic growth rises above historical averages.\nPer capita employment begins to rise appreciably.\nAsset prices rise to unusually high levels, leading to concerns about “bubbles.”\nThe medium-term inflation outlook rises temporarily above 2 percent.\nIt may not be easy to stick to this path. But I anticipate that the benefits of doing so, in terms of employment gains, will be significant.\nI have been emphasizing the similarities between the FOMC’s situation in 1979 and its situation in 2013. But I should also emphasize one critical difference between the two situations. In 1979, the FOMC was faced with what proved to be a very painful trade-off between keeping inflation low and keeping employment high. In 2013, there is no such trade-off. As I showed you earlier, the impact of the Great Recession has left both prices and employment too low. Thus, the goal-oriented policy that I’ve described should also help the FOMC do better with respect to its objective of keeping inflation close to 2 percent.\nBefore I wrap this section up, I’ll note that the FOMC’s current policy strategy differs in important ways from the goal-oriented approach that I’m recommending today. In its most recent statement, the Committee says that appropriate monetary policy should lead the unemployment rate to decline gradually and lead the inflation rate to be below 2 percent over the medium term. Under a goal-oriented approach to policy, the FOMC would view a “gradual decline” in the unemployment rate as being undesirably slow, given that the medium-term outlook for inflation is so low. Hence, the Committee’s outlook would trigger a decision to provide more monetary stimulus.\nImplications for Community Banks\nAn audience of community bank managers and owners might naturally ask, What does a goal-oriented approach to monetary policy mean for me? I would emphasize two points. First, I recommend a goal-oriented approach because it is likely to achieve the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate of price stability and low unemployment over a shorter time frame. Accelerating the progress toward these goals will improve the overall well-being of households and businesses, including banks. Put another way, the fate of community banks rests on the health of their communities. Achieving the dual mandate more rapidly aims to improve the conditions of those communities.\nSecond, the goal-oriented approach stresses clarity of communication and predictability of action. Again, the aim is to help households and businesses in general. But banks that have to make decisions with implications many years in the future should find such communication and predictability particularly helpful.\nConclusions\nMy speech is called “A Time of Testing.”\nFive years ago, in September 2008, as the nation and the world spiraled into a financial crisis, it was obvious that economic policymakers faced a time of testing. Thanks in large part to Chairman Bernanke’s strong and imaginative leadership, the Federal Reserve System was able to pass that challenging test. The System’s actions in the fall of 2008 and the first half of 2009 were critical in eliminating what was the nontrivial risk of a second Great Depression, with unemployment rates closer to 25 percent than to 10 percent.\nMy message today is that September 2013 is another time of testing. Over six years after the national unemployment rate first began its ascent, the labor market remains disturbingly weak. The good news is that, with low inflation, the FOMC has considerable monetary policy capacity at its disposal with which to address this problem.\nThe FOMC’s test today is to figure out how best to deploy this capacity. The answer lies in taking two steps. The first step is to communicate that our goal is to accomplish a fast return to maximal employment while keeping inflation close to, although possibly temporarily above, the target of 2 percent. The second step is to do whatever it takes, on an ongoing basis, to achieve that goal. A goal-oriented approach to monetary policy greatly reduced inflation in the early 1980s. Adopting such an approach in our own time would improve labor market outcomes.\nThank you. I look forward to taking your questions.\nNote\n* Thanks to Ron Feldman, David Fettig, Terry Fitzgerald, Claire Hou, Sam Schulhofer-Wohl and Kei-Mu Yi for their assistance with these remarks and the supporting materials.\nEndnotes\n1 Volcker, Paul A. 1979. “A Time of Testing.” Remarks before the American Bankers Association, New Orleans, La., Oct. 9, p. 4.\n2 Volcker, p. 5.\n3 Burns, Arthur F. 1979. “The Anguish of Central Banking.” 1979 Per Jacobsson Lecture, Belgrade, Yugoslavia, Sept. 30, p. 9.\n\nNote*\n\nThank you for that generous introduction, and thanks to Tom Bengtson and the leadership of the Bank Holding Company Association for inviting me to speak at the association’s fall seminar.

We have expanded our public outreach efforts over the past several years and the association has been, and will continue to be, a valuable partner in these efforts.\n\nThe title of my speech today is “A Time of Testing.” Paul Volcker, then Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, used the same title for a speech that he gave on October 9, 1979. Chairman Volcker intended his title to underscore that monetary policymakers in 1979 were confronted with a severe test in the form of high inflation and high inflation expectations. I use the title today to underscore that monetary policymakers in 2013 are again confronted with a severe test—but this time a test created by low employment and low employment expectations. Back in 1979, Chairman Volcker said that “this is a time of testing—a testing not only of our capacity collectively to reach coherent and intelligent policies, but to stick with them”1 [italics mine]. My theme today is that his powerful phrase applies with equal force to our current situation.\n\nLet me give you a brief roadmap of where I plan to take you today.\n\nFirst, I will show you data that depict the painfully slow pace of recovery in the U.S. labor market. Second, I will show you data that demonstrate that there is considerable monetary policy capacity with which to address this problem. Third, I will take you back to 1979 and describe the nature of the problem that monetary policymakers faced then. I will describe how they dealt with those problems by using what I would call goal-oriented monetary policy. Fourth, I will argue that there are several key parallels between 1979 and 2013. Given those parallels, monetary policymakers can best deal with the current labor market problems by also adopting a goal-oriented approach to monetary policy. Unlike 1979, though, the goal-oriented approach to monetary policy will focus on improving labor market outcomes, as opposed to lowering inflation. Finally, I will briefly describe what I think such a policy means to community banks given my audience today.\n\nThroughout my remarks, I’ll be making reference to the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC for short. The Committee currently consists of the six governors of the Federal Reserve System and the 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve Banks, including me. Its job is to set monetary policy for the United States.\n\nAs you listen to me today, please keep in mind that my views are not necessarily those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System, including other Federal Open Market Committee participants.\n\nI will begin by documenting the disturbing state of the labor market. I’ll start by showing you data on the evolution of the unemployment rate.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nIn March 2007, the unemployment rate was 4.4 percent. It rose slowly throughout 2007 to reach 5.0 percent by the end of the year. The National Bureau of Economic Research dates the Great Recession as having begun in that month. In the wake of the recession, the unemployment rate reached a peak of 10 percent in October 2009.\n\nSince that date—almost four years ago!—the unemployment rate has fallen slowly to 7.3 percent. This is still unusually high relative to the past quarter century or so: Between 1986 and 2007, the unemployment rate was only higher than 7.3 percent in 1992. The current unemployment rate is also high relative to most forecasts of its expected long-run level, including those made by the FOMC. Basically, an unemployment rate of 7.3 percent means that the U.S. labor market is far from healthy.\n\nBut I would say that this measure—troubling as it is—overstates the improvement in the U.S. labor market. To estimate the unemployment rate, the Census Bureau asks people two questions: Are you working? And, if not, have you looked for work in the past four weeks? The unemployment rate measures the ratio of the second number—the recent job searchers—to the sum of the two numbers (the recent job searchers and the workers). This means that the unemployment rate can decline for two reasons: because more people are finding work or because fewer people are choosing not to look for work. Most of the declines in the unemployment rate since October 2009 have occurred because the fraction of people who are choosing to look for work has fallen.\n\nThis characterization is borne out if we look at the evolution of the fraction of people over the age of 16 who have a job—what’s called the employment-to-population ratio.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nIn March 2007, the employment-to-population ratio was over 63 percent. The employment-to-population ratio fell sharply during the Great Recession and bottomed out at just over 58 percent in mid-2011. The percentage has risen little from this low point and remains lower than at any time between 1986 and 2007.\n\nIt is true that, even without the Great Recession, demographic forces would have led to some decline in the employment-to-population ratio since 2007. As the baby boom birth cohort—born between 1946 and 1964—ages, the fraction of retirees in the population grows steadily. But these demographic forces are simply too small to account for much of the decline in the employment-to-population ratio that I’ve described. One way to see this—but not the only way—is to focus on people who are outside the normal retirement age. Here, I’ve plotted the fraction of the population aged 25 to 54 who have a job. This ratio has improved somewhat more from its low point, but also remains lower than at any time between 1986 and 2007.\n\n\n\nLarge chart\n\nTo summarize what we learn from the charts: The good news is that the labor market has improved since the end of the Great Recession.

Also, a thank you to the members of the local business community who joined me earlier this morning to discuss business conditions in the Upper Peninsula. And finally, I also appreciated the opportunity to meet with some economics and finance students at the university this morning. As a former professor, it is always gratifying to be reminded of the curiosity and ambition of our students. All of these conversations are valuable to me, and I hold them whenever I travel throughout the Ninth District. The information that I receive at such meetings is valuable to me as a policymaker, as it provides real-time insights into the state of the economy.\nThe title of my speech today is “A Time of Testing.” Paul Volcker, then Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, used the same title for a speech that he gave on October 9, 1979. Chairman Volcker intended his title to underscore that monetary policymakers in 1979 were confronted with a severe test in the form of high inflation and high inflation expectations. I use the title today to underscore that monetary policymakers in 2013 are again confronted with a severe test—but this time a test created by low employment and low employment expectations. Back in 1979, Chairman Volcker said that “this is a time of testing—a testing not only of our capacity collectively to reach coherent and intelligent policies, but to stick with them”1 [italics mine]. My theme today is that his powerful phrase applies with equal force to our current situation.\nLet me give you a brief roadmap of where I plan to take you today.\nFirst, I will show you data that depict the painfully slow pace of recovery in the U.S. labor market. Second, I will show you data that demonstrate that there is considerable monetary policy capacity with which to address this problem. Third, I will take you back to 1979 and describe the nature of the problem that monetary policymakers faced then. I will describe how they dealt with those problems by using what I would call goal-oriented monetary policy. Fourth, I will argue that there are several key parallels between 1979 and 2013. Given those parallels, monetary policymakers can best deal with the current labor market problems by also adopting a goal-oriented approach to monetary policy. Unlike 1979, though, the goal-oriented approach to monetary policy will focus on improving labor market outcomes, as opposed to lowering inflation.\nThroughout my remarks, I’ll be making reference to the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC for short. The Committee currently consists of the six governors of the Federal Reserve System and the 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve Banks, including me. Its job is to set monetary policy for the United States.\nAs you listen to me today, please keep in mind that my views are not necessarily those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System, including other Federal Open Market Committee participants.\nEvolution of Labor Market Outcomes since 2007\nI will begin by documenting the disturbing state of the labor market. I’ll start by showing you data on the evolution of the unemployment rate. In March 2007, the unemployment rate was 4.4 percent. It rose slowly throughout 2007 to reach 5.0 percent by the end of the year. The National Bureau of Economic Research dates the Great Recession as having begun in that month. In the wake of the recession, the unemployment rate reached a peak of 10 percent in October 2009.\nLarge chart\nSince that date—almost four years ago!—the unemployment rate has fallen slowly to 7.3 percent. This is still unusually high relative to the past quarter century or so: Between 1986 and 2007, the unemployment rate was only higher than 7.3 percent in 1992. The current unemployment rate is also high relative to most forecasts of its expected long-run level, including those made by the FOMC. Basically, an unemployment rate of 7.3 percent means that the U.S. labor market is far from healthy.\nBut I would say that this measure—troubling as it is—overstates the improvement in the U.S. labor market. To estimate the unemployment rate, the Census Bureau asks people two questions: Are you working? And, if not, have you looked for work in the past four weeks? The unemployment rate measures the ratio of the second number—the recent job searchers—to the sum of the two numbers (the recent job searchers and the workers). This means that the unemployment rate can decline for two reasons: because more people are finding work or because fewer people are choosing not to look for work. Most of the declines in the unemployment rate since October 2009 have occurred because the fraction of people who are choosing to look for work has fallen.\nThis characterization is borne out if we look at the evolution of the fraction of people over the age of 16 who have a job—what’s called the employment-to-population ratio. In March 2007, the employment-to-population ratio was over 63 percent. The employment-to-population ratio fell sharply during the Great Recession and bottomed out at just over 58 percent in mid-2011. The percentage has risen little from this low point and remains lower than at any time between 1986 and 2007.\nLarge chart\nIt is true that, even without the Great Recession, demographic forces would have led to some decline in the employment-to-population ratio since 2007. As the baby boom birth cohort—born between 1946 and 1964—ages, the fraction of retirees in the population grows steadily. But these demographic forces are simply too small to account for much of the decline in the employment-to-population ratio that I’ve described. One way to see this—but not the only way—is to focus on people who are outside the normal retirement age. Here, I’ve plotted the fraction of the population aged 25 to 54 who have a job. This ratio has improved somewhat more from its low point, but also remains lower than at any time between 1986 and 2007.\nLarge chart\nTo summarize what we learn from the charts: The good news is that the labor market has improved since the end of the Great Recession. The bad news is that the rate of improvement over the past four years has been painfully slow. As a consequence, the condition of the labor market remains weak.\nThere are two aspects of the labor market situation that are worth emphasizing. First, the weak labor market represents considerable hardship for a large number of Americans, both in economic terms and in psychological terms. Second, it represents a significant waste of resources for the national economy, because our country is failing to use a large fraction of our human potential. For both of these reasons, I believe that those of us who are charged with making economic policy should do whatever we can to facilitate a faster rate of improvement in labor market conditions.\nPotential Usefulness of Monetary Policy\nI have shown you evidence that the labor market is currently weak. But the charts also show that the labor market has been weak for several years. Some observers have concluded from this persistence that monetary policy cannot ameliorate the problems in the labor market. One of my main points today is that this conclusion of monetary policy impotence is at odds with the behavior of inflation.\nTo understand this point, it’s useful to look at the behavior of personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation over the past few years. Just to be clear, this is a measure of inflation that incorporates the prices of all goods and services, including food and energy. Since the beginning of the Great Recession in December 2007, the PCE inflation rate has averaged around 1.5 percent. This is noticeably below the FOMC’s target inflation rate of 2 percent per year. And the outlook for future inflation is similarly subdued. Thus, earlier this year, the Congressional Budget Office projected that PCE inflation will remain below the FOMC’s target of 2 percent until the year 2018.\nLarge chart\nThese low levels of inflation tell us that monetary policy can be useful in increasing the rate of improvement in the labor market. Here’s what I mean. At a basic level, monetary stimulus increases the demand for goods among households and firms. This higher demand for goods tends to push upward on both prices and employment. Hence, the downside with using monetary policy to stimulate employment is that, when employment is near its maximum level, further stimulus can lead to unduly high inflation. But the data show that over the past few years inflation has been below the FOMC’s target of 2 percent. It’s expected to remain below desirable levels for years to come. These low levels of inflation show that the FOMC has a lot of room to provide much needed stimulus to the labor market.\nLearning from 1979\nI have argued that there is monetary policy capacity to ameliorate the severe weakness in U.S. labor market conditions. I next turn to the question of how best to use that capacity. In answering this question, I believe that it is useful to consider how the Federal Open Market Committee successfully solved the problem of high inflation back in the early 1980s.\nEarlier, I referred to a speech given by Paul Volcker in October 1979, early in his term as Chairman of the FOMC. At that time, the annual inflation rate was over 9 percent, after rising throughout the prior 15 years. Many observers felt that monetary policy was powerless to roll back (or possibly even to stem) this steady increase. As Chairman Volcker noted in his speech, “Some would argue that inflation is so bound up with ... deep-seated forces that monetary and fiscal policies are impotent,” and that “we face impossible choices between inflation and prosperity.”2 Indeed, only 10 days before Chairman Volcker spoke, former Federal Reserve Chairman Arthur Burns had given a speech of his own in which he argued that the increase in inflation was grounded in “philosophic and political currents that have been transforming economic life in the United States ... since the 1930s.”3\nThe perception that monetary policymakers could not (or would not) address the problem of high inflation was actually a key part of the problem facing the FOMC in 1979. If the public believes that it is impossible to reduce inflation, then the public will expect high inflation to persist or even to increase. Those high inflation expectations themselves generate high inflation. After all, if businesses expect high inflation, they will raise their prices more. And, if workers expect high inflation, they will ask for higher wage increases. In this way, the perception of monetary policy impotence in 1979 was itself a key force in generating higher inflation.\nFaced with this challenging issue, the FOMC followed what I would term goal-oriented monetary policy. This approach had two parts. First, the Committee formulated and communicated a clear goal: It intended to bring inflation down as quickly as possible. Second, on an ongoing basis, the Committee did whatever it took to achieve that goal, even if those actions had short-term economic costs. In particular, the Committee maintained tight monetary policy so as to push down inflation, even as interest rates and the unemployment rate soared to post-World War II highs. By following a goal-oriented policy, the FOMC was successful in brnging down both inflation and inflation expectations. Indeed, as early as late 1983, inflation had fallen below 4 percent.\nIn hindsight, I think that it is clear why the FOMC was so successful. With goal-oriented policy, communications and actions work together in a powerful fashion. Communications tell the public where the FOMC is taking the economy. Then, every subsequent action gives the public confidence that the Committee is willing and able to take the economy in that direction. Actions and communications operate together to destroy the dangerous perception of monetary policy ineffectiveness.\nGoal-Oriented Policy in 2013\nI’ve spent a lot of time talking about 1979, because I see three key parallels between the economic situation in 1979 and the economic situation in 2013. First, just like in 1979, the Federal Open Market Committee faces a challenging macroeconomic problem—although this time, the problem is stubbornly low employment as opposed to stubbornly high inflation. Second, there is a widespread perception that monetary policymakers lack either the tools or the will to solve this problem.\nAnd third, the perception of monetary policy ineffectiveness is itself a key factor in generating the problem. Let me elaborate on this last point. If the public thinks that monetary policy is ineffective, then it will expect relatively weak macroeconomic conditions in the future. But these expectations about the future have a direct impact on current macroeconomic outcomes. If households expect their incomes to be low in the future, they will save more and spend less today. If businesses expect low future demand for their products, they will invest less today and hire fewer people today. In this way, any perceptions of future FOMC ineffectiveness in generating favorable macroeconomic outcomes are hurting current employment.\nWe’ve seen how the FOMC dealt with its problems in 1979 by adopting a goal-oriented approach to monetary policy. Given the parallels between 1979 and 2013, I believe that a goal-oriented approach would be useful again. In 1979, the FOMC’s goal was to return inflation to low levels as rapidly as it could. In 2013, the FOMC’s goal should be to return employment to its maximal level as rapidly as it can, while still keeping inflation close to, although possibly temporarily above, the target of 2 percent. Note that, by keeping inflation expectations well-anchored, the inflation requirement ensures that monetary policy remains effective as a form of employment stimulus.\nBut, as Paul Volcker said in his 1979 speech, it is not enough to formulate or communicate a goal. The Committee has to stick to its formulated approach—that is, it must do whatever it takes to achieve its communicated goal. In the early 1980s, doing whatever it took meant being willing to keep money tight, even though interest rates and the unemployment rate rose to unusual heights. By doing whatever it took to achieve its goal, despite these short-term costs, the FOMC was able to bring down inflation and inflation expectations.\nDoing whatever it takes in the next few years will mean something different. It will mean that the FOMC is willing to continue to use the unconventional monetary policy tools that it has employed in the past few years. Indeed, it will mean that the FOMC is willing to use any of its congressionally authorized tools to achieve the goal of higher employment, no matter how unconventional those tools might be. Moreover, doing whatever it takes will mean keeping a historically unusual amount of monetary stimulus in place—and possibly providing more stimulus—even as:\nInterest rates remain near historic lows.\nEconomic growth rises above historical averages.\nPer capita employment begins to rise appreciably.\nAsset prices rise to unusually high levels, leading to concerns about “bubbles.”\nThe medium-term inflation outlook rises temporarily above 2 percent.\nIt may not be easy to stick to this path. But I anticipate that the benefits of doing so, in terms of employment gains, will be significant.\nI have been emphasizing the similarities between the FOMC’s situation in 1979 and its situation in 2013. But I should also emphasize one critical difference between the two situations. In 1979, the FOMC was faced with what proved to be a very painful trade-off between keeping inflation low and keeping employment high. In 2013, there is no such trade-off. As I showed you earlier, the impact of the Great Recession has left both prices and employment too low. Thus, the goal-oriented policy that I’ve described should also help the FOMC do better with respect to its objective of keeping inflation close to 2 percent.\nBefore I wrap up, I’ll note that the FOMC’s current policy strategy differs in important ways from the goal-oriented approach that I’m recommending today. In its most recent statement, the Committee says that appropriate monetary policy should lead the unemployment rate to decline gradually and lead the inflation rate to be below 2 percent over the medium term. Under a goal-oriented approach to policy, the FOMC would view a “gradual decline” in the unemployment rate as being undesirably slow, given that the medium-term outlook for inflation is so low. Hence, the Committee’s outlook would trigger a decision to provide more monetary stimulus.\nConclusions\nMy speech is called “A Time of Testing.”\nFive years ago, in September 2008, as the nation and the world spiraled into a financial crisis, it was obvious that economic policymakers faced a time of testing. Thanks in large part to Chairman Bernanke’s strong and imaginative leadership, the Federal Reserve System was able to pass that challenging test. The System’s actions in the fall of 2008 and the first half of 2009 were critical in eliminating what was the nontrivial risk of a second Great Depression, with unemployment rates closer to 25 percent than to 10 percent.\nMy message today is that September 2013 is another time of testing. Over six years after the national unemployment rate first began its ascent, the labor market remains disturbingly weak. The good news is that, with low inflation, the FOMC has considerable monetary policy capacity at its disposal with which to address this problem.\nThe FOMC’s test today is to figure out how best to deploy this capacity. The answer lies in taking two steps. The first step is to communicate that our goal is to accomplish a fast return to maximal employment while keeping inflation close to, although possibly temporarily above, the target of 2 percent. The second step is to do whatever it takes, on an ongoing basis, to achieve that goal. A goal-oriented approach to monetary policy greatly reduced inflation in the early 1980s. Adopting such an approach in our own time would improve labor market outcomes.\nThank you. I look forward to taking your questions.\nNote\n* Thanks to Ron Feldman, David Fettig, Terry Fitzgerald, Claire Hou, Sam Schulhofer-Wohl and Kei-Mu Yi for their assistance with these remarks and the supporting materials.\nEndnotes\n1 Volcker, Paul A. 1979. “A Time of Testing.” Remarks before the American Bankers Association, New Orleans, La., Oct. 9, p. 4.\n2 Volcker, p. 5.\n3 Burns, Arthur F. 1979. “The Anguish of Central Banking.” 1979 Per Jacobsson Lecture, Belgrade, Yugoslavia, Sept. 30, p. 9.\n\nNote*\n\nThank you for that generous introduction, and thanks to the Rotary Club of Houghton for hosting this event, and especially to Michigan Technological University for inviting me here today.

The second step is to do whatever it takes, on an ongoing basis, to achieve that goal. A goal-oriented approach to monetary policy greatly reduced inflation in the early 1980s. Adopting such an approach in our own time would improve labor market outcomes.\n\nThank you.

My theme in this talk is that his powerful phrase applies with equal force to our current monetary policy situation. In 1979, Chairman Volcker was referring to the need to deal with ongoing high inflation. In my talk today, I will be referring to the need to deal with ongoing low employment.\nThe recovery in the U.S. labor market continues to be painfully slow. As a consequence, the condition of the labor market remains disturbingly weak, representing considerable hardship for a large number of Americans and a significant waste of resources for the national economy. Fortunately, there is good news: The low levels of inflation realizations and medium-term inflation expectations—both notably below the FOMC’s target inflation rate of 2 percent per year—demonstrate that there is considerable monetary policy capacity to provide much needed stimulus to the labor market.\nHow best to deploy that capacity? I argue in this talk that we can learn a lot about the answer to this question by looking back to 1979. At that time, the perception that monetary policymakers could not (or would not) address the problem of high inflation was actually a key part of the problem facing the FOMC. Faced with this challenging issue, the FOMC followed what I would term goal-oriented monetary policy. This approach had two parts. First, the Committee formulated and communicated a clear goal: It intended to bring inflation down as quickly as possible. Second, on an ongoing basis, the Committee did whatever it took to achieve that goal, even if those actions had short-term economic costs. By following a goal-oriented policy, communications and actions worked together in a powerful fashion in bringing down both inflation and inflation expectations.\nI see key parallels between the economic situation in 2013 and the situation in 1979. The FOMC again faces a challenging macroeconomic problem—stubbornly low employment this time instead of stubbornly high inflation. There is again a widespread perception that monetary policymakers lack either the tools or the will to solve this problem. And the perception of monetary policy ineffectiveness is itself a key factor in generating the current poor economic performance. Given the parallels between 1979 and 2013, I believe that a goal-oriented approach would be useful again.\nThe FOMC’s goal should be to return employment to its maximal level as rapidly as it can, while still keeping inflation close to, although possibly temporarily above, the target of 2 percent. But it is not enough to formulate or communicate a goal. The Committee has to stick to its formulated approach—that is, it must do whatever it takes to achieve its communicated goal. Doing whatever it takes in the next few years will mean that the FOMC is willing to use any of its congressionally authorized tools to achieve the goal of higher employment, no matter how unconventional those tools might be.\nA goal-oriented approach to monetary policy greatly reduced inflation in the early 1980s.

            "content": "Thank you for that introduction and thanks, especially, to all of you for coming tonight to this Town Hall. It is great to see so much interest in the Federal Reserve. In a few minutes, I will answer any questions that you might have about the Federal Reserve, or the Fed as it is commonly known. I look forward to our discussion.\nBut first—a disclaimer. As you will hear shortly, I’m one of the 19 people who have the privilege and honor to participate in the meetings of what’s called the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). FOMC meetings shape the course of monetary policy in the United States. But it’s very important to understand that, in my remarks today, I’m telling you only my own views, and those perspectives are not necessarily those of any other FOMC participant.\nFederal Reserve Structure and the Making of Monetary Policy\nLet me begin with some background about the Fed. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts, and our district includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\nAs I mentioned, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—is the Fed’s monetary policymaking body. It meets eight times per year to set the course of monetary policy. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks travel from their home districts to Washington to contribute to these deliberations, along with the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board. In this way, representatives from different regions of the country have direct input into the setting of American monetary policy.\nCongress requires the FOMC to make monetary policy so as to fulfill two mandates: promote price stability and promote maximum employment. It should be clear that these are both Main Street objectives that benefit all Americans. Promoting maximum employment means that the Fed is charged with doing what it can to ensure that Americans who want to work can do so. Promoting price stability means that the Federal Reserve is charged with keeping inflation close to a pre-specified target. Price stability ensures that, when people write contracts in terms of dollars, like student loans or annuities, they can have certainty about what those dollars will be able to buy in the future.\nNow, in describing price stability, I’ve made reference to a “pre-specified target” for inflation. I haven’t said what the pre-specified inflation target is. In choosing its inflation target, the FOMC weighed the costs of overly high inflation against the need to guard against potentially destructive negative inflation—so-called deflation. This assessment has led the FOMC to pick an inflation target of 2 percent. Similarly, most central banks around the world have opted for a low but still positive inflation target.\nThe FOMC acts to achieve its two mandates—maximum employment and price stability—by influencing interest rates through the purchase and sale of financial assets. When interest rates rise, households and firms tend to spend less and save more. The fall in spending puts downward pressure on both employment and prices. When interest rates fall, households and firms tend to spend more and save less. This puts upward pressure on employment and prices.\nCurrent Monetary Policy Stance\nWith that context, let me turn to the current stance of monetary policy. Six years ago, in the fall of 2007, the Federal Reserve had under $900 billion of assets, mostly in the form of short-term Treasuries. It was targeting a fed funds rate—the short-term interbank lending rate—of just under 5 percent. Six years later, the Federal Reserve owns well over $3 trillion of assets, mostly in the form of long-term government-issued or government-backed securities. It plans to buy still more over the remainder of 2013. It has also been targeting a fed funds rate of under a quarter percent for nearly five years. It anticipates continuing to do so at least until the unemployment rate, currently at 7.4 percent, falls below 6.5 percent, as long as inflation remains under control.\nThese policy actions—buying long-term assets and keeping short-term interest rates low—are designed to stimulate spending by households and firms, and thereby push up on both prices and employment. Is the FOMC’s policy stance providing an appropriate amount of stimulus to the economy? To answer this question, we have to compare the economy’s performance relative to the FOMC’s goals of price stability and maximum employment. In July, the unemployment rate was 7.4 percent—much higher than the FOMC’s current assessment of the longer-run normal unemployment rate, which is between 5.2 percent and 6 percent. At the same time, personal consumption expenditure inflation—including food and energy—is running well below the Fed’s target of 2 percent.\nBut current monetary policy is typically thought to affect the macroeconomy with a one- to two-year lag. This means that we should always judge the appropriateness of current monetary policy in terms of what it implies for the future evolution of inflation and employment. Along those lines, after its most recent meeting, the FOMC announced that it expects that inflation will remain below 2 percent over the medium term and that unemployment will decline only gradually. These forecasts imply that the Committee is failing to provide sufficient stimulus to the economy.\nConclusions\nLet me wrap up. In my discussion about the Federal Reserve, I’ve described our decentralized structure and I’ve emphasized our Main Street objectives of price stability and maximum employment. I see our structure and our goals as entirely complementary. In my view, having people from around the country—the presidents of the various regional Reserve banks—participate in monetary policy deliberations is valuable in ensuring that those discussions always put our Main Street goals at center stage.\nTo achieve its goals, the FOMC has taken some historically unprecedented monetary policy actions in recent years. But the U.S. economy is recovering from the largest adverse shock in 80 years—and a historically unprecedented shock should lead to a historically unprecedented monetary policy response. Indeed, the FOMC’s own forecasts suggest that it should be providing more stimulus to the economy, not less.\nThank you for your time and attention. I’ll be happy to take your questions.\n\nThank you for that introduction and thanks, especially, to all of you for coming tonight to this Town Hall.

It is my great pleasure to welcome all of you to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis for this important discussion about a topic that directly or indirectly impacts the lives of all Minnesotans—secure trade and travel between this state and our neighbor to the north, Canada.\nIt struck me when reviewing the list of attendees that I should extend a special welcome to certain guests and to acknowledge those important agencies and institutions represented here today. But then I realized I would have to name practically everyone on the attendee list. This is truly an impressive gathering, and I commend all of you for joining us here today. Having said that, however, I hope you will indulge me as I offer a particular welcome to Senator Amy Klobuchar and to Consul General Martin Loken. We are very pleased that Senator Klobuchar has made time in her busy schedule to be with us today by video, and we look forward to her remarks. And thank you, Martin, for reaching out to the Federal Reserve Bank as a partner for this conference. Our bank and the consulate general have had a good working relationship in the past, and we look forward to strengthening that relationship in the future.\nBefore I say more about the bank’s interest in the issues on hand today, I should note that I have a personal interest in issues relating to Canada. I was born in Baltimore, but from the age of 1 to 15, I grew up in Canada. (I don’t recall my parents asking for my permission before they moved me from my native country, but perhaps they did.) Most of that time I spent in Winnipeg—which means that I’m one of the few people who live in the Twin Cities who is more worried about how hot the summers are as opposed to how cold the winters are.\nI think that my time in Canada gave me a better understanding of the special relationship that Canada has with the United States. Now, the Canadians in this room know that one peculiarity about that special relationship is that many people in the United States are unaware of it. Canadian students grow up learning about the United States and, subsequently, paying attention to the United States in ways that are not typically reciprocated by their southern neighbors. But—having lived most of the past 15 years here in Minnesota—I have found that Minnesotans are, in fact, much more engaged with Canada than is true of the denizens of more southern climes. Minnesotans understand the value of the relationship between our state and Canada, and we take a keen interest in the evolving economic partnership between our two countries.\nSome of you are perhaps aware of one of this bank’s publications, the fedgazette, a newspaper dedicated to business and economic news in our Ninth District. Most of the Ninth District borders Canada, and over the years our writers and analysts have reported on important economic issues affecting trade. Indeed, the inaugural issue of the fedgazette in 1989 devoted considerable space to the Canada/U.S. Trade Agreement, or CUSTA, a precursor to its more famous acronym, NAFTA, or the North American Free Trade Agreement, which also included Mexico. In one of those fedgazette articles, then Canadian Consul General John Blackwood said that such agreements would replace the economics of tariffs with the economics of transportation. The cost/benefit of cross-border business will be influenced more by proximity, Blackwood said, and not by penalties.\nIf Minnesota’s experience is any indication, that was certainly the case here. Trade between Minnesota and Canada, adjusted for inflation, increased approximately fourfold between 1990 and 2011. Of course, all of that increase was not due solely to trade agreements, but it is important to recall that most goods crossing the border between Minnesota and Canada were subject to tariffs prior to those agreements. And you don’t have to be an economist to know that tariffs deter trade.\nToday we are here to discuss the latest in the long and successful history of trade negotiations between the United States and Canada, and to focus specifically on its impact on the state of Minnesota. Once again, I would like to thank Martin for bringing this important conversation to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Part of our charge as a district Federal Reserve Bank is to monitor our district’s economy, and a key part of our economy’s strength is the amount of business that our district does with Canada. So I welcome all of you here today and look forward to our discussion. Thank you.\nEndnote\n1 I thank David Fettig and Kei-Mu Yi for their contributions to these remarks.\n\nNote1\n\nGood afternoon, everyone.

            "content": "Note1\nBasic economics says that a policymaker should set a policy instrument so that, on the margin, there is no net benefit to altering it. But while the policymaker’s decision is necessarily made today, the resultant costs and benefits are realized only in the future. Therefore, the policymaker’s optimal choice is to set the policy instrument so that the outlook for the future marginal net benefit is zero. In this talk, I address the following question: How can the policymaker formulate the needed outlook for marginal net benefits? Policymakers often attempt to do so by using statistical models to forecast future marginal net benefits. I argue that policymakers can achieve better outcomes by basing their outlooks on risk-neutral probabilities derived from the prices of financial derivatives.\nThe benefit of using risk-neutral probabilities arises from the observation that resources may be more valuable in one state of the world relative to another, equally likely, state of the world. (For example, the economy might be in a deep recession in the former state and in a boom in the latter.) In weighing future costs and benefits, the policymaker should take account of this differential valuation of resources in different states. Because they are derived from market prices, risk-neutral probabilities provide the needed information about the relative values of resources in different states of the world in a way that purely statistical forecasts cannot.\nAfter presenting my general argument, I illustrate it using the example of a central bank that has a single mandate of targeting an inflation rate of pi_bar. Monetary policy operates with lags, and inflation is affected by shocks other than the central bank’s decision. Hence, the best that the central bank can do is to ensure that its medium-term outlook for inflation always equals pi_bar. My general argument implies that the appropriate outlook for the central bank is not a statistical forecast of inflation, but rather the risk-neutral expectation of inflation, calculated using risk-neutral probabilities. This risk-neutral expectation can be measured using inflation break-evens on assets like zero coupon inflation swaps or TIPS bonds. Hence, it is optimal for an inflation-targeting central bank to follow policies that ensure that inflation break-evens remain close to pi_bar.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis reports measures of risk-neutral probabilities on its website. These reports are based on a variety of option prices and are updated every two weeks.\nEndnotes\n1 I am speaking for myself today, and not for others in the Federal Reserve or on the Federal Open Market Committee.\nOptimal Outlooks - Presentation Slides [PDF]\nOptimal Outlooks\nJune 3, 2012\nPresident Kocherlakota previously gave a similar speech at the Financial Intermediation Research Society Conference on June 3rd, 2012. View the video of that speech and the Q & A that followed.\n\nNote1\n\nBasic economics says that a policymaker should set a policy instrument so that, on the margin, there is no net benefit to altering it. But while the policymaker’s decision is necessarily made today, the resultant costs and benefits are realized only in the future. Therefore, the policymaker’s optimal choice is to set the policy instrument so that the outlook for the future marginal net benefit is zero. In this talk, I address the following question: How can the policymaker formulate the needed outlook for marginal net benefits? Policymakers often attempt to do so by using statistical models to forecast future marginal net benefits. I argue that policymakers can achieve better outcomes by basing their outlooks on risk-neutral probabilities derived from the prices of financial derivatives.\n\nThe benefit of using risk-neutral probabilities arises from the observation that resources may be more valuable in one state of the world relative to another, equally likely, state of the world.

It is an honor and a pleasure to speak before a group that plays an instrumental role in the formation and growth of new and young businesses. As many of you likely know, those types of businesses are key to employment growth, especially in periods following recessions. As you also know, employment growth has been disappointing, to say the least, coming out of the period known as the Great Recession. I will have more to say about this in a few minutes, but I want to add that I look forward to your questions and comments at the close of my remarks. I like to remind audiences that monetary policymakers have no end of data at their fingertips, but data lag by weeks and sometimes months, and policymakers need to make decisions in real time. Input from groups like this—just like that which I receive from our Bank’s Board of Directors, our Advisory Councils, and from people across the Ninth District on my travels—is important in helping to shape my understanding of the economy. So thank you for inviting me here today, both to share my views and also to hear your own.\nI became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis in October 2009. One of my main objectives since then has been to make both the Minneapolis Fed and the Federal Reserve System more open and transparent. And I’ve been delighted to learn that I’m not at all alone in this pursuit of greater openness. I see many positive developments along these lines throughout the System, and especially on the part of the Federal Open Market Committee. The FOMC, as you no doubt know, is the monetary policymaking arm of the Federal Reserve. It meets every six to seven weeks to chart the course of monetary policy. The members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 regional Feds, including me, all take part in these meetings.\nToday, I will talk about a significant improvement in the FOMC’s communication about monetary policy: In January 2012, the FOMC released a consensus statement describing its long-run framework. Congress has given the Federal Reserve a dual mandate: to promote maximum employment and to promote price stability. The January framework statement is important because it outlines the strategy that the FOMC follows in order to implement the FOMC’s dual mandate.\nAs you will hear, the framework statement provides a quantitative definition for price stability, through a numerical target for inflation. It does not do the same for maximum employment. I will spend a considerable amount of time discussing this latter aspect of the statement and its relevance for current policy.\nBefore proceeding, I’ll remind you that my remarks reflect my thoughts, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nA brief history of Fed transparency\nI’ll begin with some historical context. Over the past 30 years, central banks all over the world have become much more transparent about their objectives and how their current actions allow them to achieve those objectives. This transparency is widely viewed—by both policymakers and scholars—as an important means of enhancing the effectiveness of monetary policy.\nMost central banks aim to keep medium-term inflation low and stable—at around 2 percent annually. They have been quite successful in achieving that goal over the past 20 or 25 years. They view that success as being due in part to their communicating on an ongoing basis how their current policy actions are consistent with that goal.\nThere are at least two benefits of transparency. The first is broadly appreciated: By being clear about their objectives, central banks are better able to achieve those objectives. For example, if the central bank’s announced inflation target is 2 percent per year, firms and employees know that wages need to grow by 2 percent to keep up with the cost of living. That knowledge helps prevent wages from growing so fast that firms have to raise prices by more than 2 percent to cover their costs—and that in turn contributes to keeping inflation under control. In brief, then, transparency helps anchor inflation expectations.\nThe second benefit of transparency is less appreciated, but no less important. A transparent central bank is more accountable to the public because it is forced to be more disciplined in ensuring that its policy actions are in fact consistent with its policy objectives. The central bank knows the public will be able to track its performance. When performance matches words, the public will have an even stronger belief in the central bank, which serves to anchor inflation expectations more solidly.\nSo, there has been a trend toward central bank transparency internationally. What about here in the United States? I think we can all take pride in the fact that under Chairman Bernanke and his predecessor, Chairman Greenspan, the Fed has made enormous strides in transparency. It is easy to forget that, as recently as 1993, the FOMC would act and not tell anyone for 90 days! It was not until 2000 that the FOMC began issuing the statement that many of us now take for granted. And it was a decade ago that the roll call vote of FOMC members was added to the statement. Thus, there has been substantial progress in monetary policy transparency over the past 15 or so years.\nAs of the beginning of 2011, the Committee had arrived at three main forms of communication. First, immediately after every meeting, the Committee issues a carefully worded, but brief, statement intended to describe the current state of the economy and the current stance of monetary policy. Second, three weeks after each meeting, the Committee issues a carefully worded set of minutes that provides a longer, but still relatively high-level, description of interactions within the meeting. Third, after the January, April, June, and October/November meetings, the FOMC releases a summary of economic projections. Among other things, these quarterly releases contain information about FOMC meeting participants’ goals for medium-run inflation and unemployment (roughly, over the next five to six years).\nThe framework statement\nThere have been several changes in FOMC communications over the past year, including the introduction of regular press conferences by the chairman and the regular release of FOMC participants’ individual assessments of the appropriate path of short-term interest rates. But I want to spend my time today discussing the change that I view as the most important: the FOMC’s release in January 2012 of a five-paragraph statement describing its long-run framework.\nIt is important to be clear that the statement does not represent any change in the Committee’s approach to policy. However, it does represent a major step forward in the Committee’s communication of that approach to the public. In particular, I think of this statement as providing the basic principles of how the Committee implements its statutory dual mandate that monetary policy should promote price stability and maximum employment. I won’t go through the statement in any detail. Frankly, there is no need for me to do so: It is short and remarkably well-worded, and it deliberately shies away from technical language. I encourage all of you—indeed, all Americans—to read it when you have the opportunity.2\nWhat I will do instead is describe four aspects of the framework statement that I view as especially important. The first key aspect of the framework is that it specifically translates the term “price stability” into a 2 percent target for inflation. The American public need guess no longer about the Federal Reserve’s inflation intentions—either on the upside or on the downside: 2 percent is our goal.\nSecond, the framework describes how the Committee weighs the two mandates— promoting maximum employment and promoting price stability—against one another. Importantly, it stresses that the two mandates are typically complementary, in the sense that keeping unemployment from rising too high also keeps inflation from falling too low. I think that this point is often under-emphasized in popular discussions of monetary policy.\nThird, the framework enjoyed broad consensus support among meeting participants. This suggests that any changes in the framework will require the same level of broad consensus support. In this sense, one can think of the framework as being like a constitution.\nI have moved quickly through the first three of these key elements of the framework statement—inflation target of 2 percent, the typical complementarity of the two mandates, and the quasi-constitutionality of the statement. This fourth key feature of the statement is that while it provides a numerical target for inflation, it does not provide a similar explicit quantitative interpretation of the second mandate: “maximum employment.” I want to spend the rest of my time discussing why it does not do so.\nEstimating maximum employment\nI’ll start with a quote from the framework statement itself: “The maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the job market.” What are these nonmonetary factors? There are many, including population trends, the incentives built into the tax system, the incentives built into social insurance safety nets, the returns to human capital accumulation for young people, and simply social norms. The FOMC has no control over these nonmonetary factors. Its job is to attain the maximum level of employment attainable through monetary policy, taking these other nonmonetary factors as given.\nIt is important to note that the long list of nonmonetary factors includes nonmonetary policies. It follows that, even if employment is close to the maximum level that is achievable using monetary policy, there may well be nonmonetary policy levers that could be used to raise employment still higher. For example, suppose that Congress and the president choose to reduce the payroll tax paid by employers. Such a move would provide an additional incentive to employers to hire more workers (albeit at the cost of increasing the deficit), and increase employment and reduce unemployment.\nAll of these nonmonetary factors, policy or otherwise, fluctuate over time. Their changes in turn generate fluctuations in the level of maximum employment achievable through monetary policy—fluctuations that are often hard to gauge on a real-time basis. In what follows, I will spend some time describing why I believe that the Committee currently faces an especially large amount of uncertainty about the level of maximum employment that it can hope to achieve.\nI’ll start by showing you graphs of four measures of the recent adverse changes in U.S. labor market performance. To understand the graphs, it’s helpful to recall that economists define the labor force to include all of those over 16 years of age who have a job or who have looked for a job in the past four weeks. All of the charts depict annual data through 2011.\nThe first graph depicts the evolution of the unemployment rate over time—the fraction of people in the labor force who have looked for a job in the past four weeks. The graph shows that after rising sharply from 2007 to 2009 (the shaded area indicates the recession period), the unemployment rate has been falling slowly.3\n  Large Image\nThe next graph shows the evolution of the employment/population ratio over time—the fraction of people who have a job. To eliminate some of the possible demographic shifts that might otherwise influence this picture, the graph focuses on people between 25 and 54 years old, the so-called prime age population for the job market. We can see a sharp decline in this ratio from 2007 to 2009. And, in contrast to the unemployment rate, there has been no noticeable recovery in this measure.\nLarge Image\nThe third graph is a depiction of the fraction of the population between ages 25 and 54 who are in the labor force—that is, they either have a job or have looked for one in the past month. Economists refer to this as the labor force participation rate. An interesting aspect of this graph is that this fraction has tended downward since the late 1990s. This downward path has accelerated since 2008.\nLarge Image\nThe final graph depicts the relationship of unfilled job openings and unemployment over time. The horizontal axis shows the unemployment rate. The vertical axis is the job openings or vacancy rate—the ratio of job openings to the sum of employment and job openings. Each point on this graph corresponds to a different year, and represents the average unemployment rate and the average vacancy rate in that year.\nLarge Image\nWhen the economy is doing well, firms usually hire more workers and they find it more challenging to fill their available openings. Hence, the unemployment rate is low, and the vacancy rate is high. So, typically, as the economy improves, the plotted points move toward the upper left in this picture. Conversely, when economic times get worse, the plotted points move to the southeast. This creates a curve that runs from the northwest to the southeast—a curve that’s known as the Beveridge curve.\nHowever, in the Great Recession and its aftermath, we have seen something different: The Beveridge curve itself has shifted out toward the upper right. Economists see this kind of outward shift as representing a decline in the ability of the labor market to form mutually beneficial matches between workers and firms. In that sense, the labor market is less efficient. The outward shift means that firms can’t fill their available job openings as readily as we would have expected in light of the high unemployment rate.\nTo summarize: Labor market outcomes do remain notably worse than prior to the recession. The good news is that the unemployment rate has been declining since the end of the recession. But there is also countervailing evidence: The labor force participation rate has been falling steadily, and the employment/population ratio remains near its low point. The Beveridge curve shows considerable deterioration in labor market matching efficiency.\nHow persistent will these changes in U.S. labor markets prove to be? Economists hold at least two views on this question. The first is guided by the patterns in post-World War II data for the United States. These patterns suggest that the current deterioration in U.S. labor market performance is indeed reversible under appropriate policy.\nThe second view is less sanguine. It says that the post-World War II data do not contain an economic crisis of the kind or magnitude that hit the United States in 2008. Such a crisis could well have a different kind of impact on labor markets than the earlier postwar recessions.\nThe Swedish experience\nThis latter view is also informed by data from other countries—not just the United States. My staff and I have recently taken a close look at data from Sweden.4 Why Sweden? In the early 1990s, Sweden was hit by a financial, banking, and currency crisis—what one might term a triple crisis. Of course, other industrialized countries—perhaps most notably Japan—have experienced these kinds of crises. My staff and I have focused on Sweden because it is generally viewed as having dealt with this triple crisis in a highly effective fashion. For example, in 2007, OECD economists wrote, “Sweden’s economy has made a remarkable recovery from the major crisis of the early 1990s,” in emphasizing Sweden’s rapid productivity growth in the previous two decades.5\nDespite this success, the triple crisis had a profound and highly persistent effect on the Swedish labor market. To see this, let’s look at graphs for the same four variables in Sweden that I showed you earlier for the United States.6 I’ve shaded the period 1991-93 in these graphs to indicate the heart of the triple crisis period in Sweden.\nThe first graph depicts the Swedish unemployment rate. From 1980 to 1990, the unemployment rate had never been above 4 percent and was typically closer to 2 percent. After 1993, the unemployment rate was never much below 6 percent.\nLarge Image\nThe second graph depicts the Swedish employment/population ratio, again for those between ages 25 and 54. From 1980 to 1990, the employment/population ratio grew steadily in Sweden and peaked at over 91 percent. After 1993, the ratio trended upward slightly but remained below 86 percent for most of the period.\nLarge Image\nNext, we see the evolution of the fraction of Swedes aged 25-54 years who are in the labor force. From 1980 to 1990, this fraction rose to a high of over 92 percent. After 1993, it was typically around 88 percent and never much above 90 percent.\nLarge Image\nFinally, we can look at the Beveridge curve—the joint evolution of unfilled job openings and unemployment. The Swedish Beveridge curve shifted outward from 1990 to 1995—and that shift has endured through at least 2010.\nLarge Image\nTo sum up: These four measures of Swedish labor market performance declined markedly after the triple crisis of the early 1990s. At least up until now, this decline has proved to be permanent. I should note too that these changes happened over a remarkably short span. In its February 1995 inflation report, the Riksbank, the Swedish central bank, suggests that the rate of unemployment that they viewed as sustainable over the long run had risen from 2-3 percent to 6 percent in less than five years.7 Their assessment—again, made in 1995—has proven to be a remarkably accurate characterization of how Swedish labor markets functioned over the next 15 years.\nIt is important to emphasize that, of course, there are many institutional differences between Sweden and the United States, especially in terms of tax systems and social safety nets. It would be a mistake to conclude from the Swedish data alone that the recent decline in U.S. labor market measures is inevitably a permanent one. But Sweden is not atypical. Cross-country research from Reinhart and Reinhart (2010) has found that financial crises tend to be followed by sustained increases in unemployment.8\nHence, I do think that the Swedish data—given that they come from a country generally regarded as an exemplar of how to handle a financial crisis—have to be viewed as informative. At a minimum, Sweden’s experience forces us to contemplate the possibility that the erosion in labor market performance that we’ve seen in the United States over the past five years may be highly persistent, even under appropriate monetary policy.\nPolicy implications\nOver the past ten minutes or so, I have talked about the recent adverse changes in U.S. labor market performance. I have discussed two sharply different possible ways to view those changes: first, that they are largely reversible under appropriate monetary policy and, second, that they are likely to be highly persistent. These two possibilities suggest that the FOMC is confronted with an unusually high degree of uncertainty about the level of “maximum employment” it can achieve. This uncertainty translates directly into a corresponding uncertainty about the appropriate approach to policy. In particular, policymakers who see the deterioration in labor market performance as reversible using monetary policy will typically favor more accommodative policy than those who view the deterioration as more protracted.\nFortunately, we can use other sources of information to reduce the level of uncertainty about the maximum level of employment achievable through monetary policy. “Maximum employment” for monetary policy is widely interpreted as the level of employment that is sustainable through monetary policy actions without an acceleration in inflation. While we cannot directly observe “maximum employment,” we do observe inflation, and its behavior is a useful signal of how close we are to the maximum level of employment achievable by the FOMC.\nSo, what has been happening with inflation? Inflation was distinctly higher in 2011 than in 2010. Even core measures of inflation, which strip out energy goods and services, and food, went up notably. I see these changes as a signal that our country’s current labor market performance is closer to “maximum employment,” given the tools available to the FOMC, than the post-World War II U.S. data alone would suggest. As I’ve argued in the past, appropriate monetary policy should be responsive to such signals.\nIt is worth reiterating a point that I made earlier. “Maximum employment” for monetary policy is not the same as “maximum employment” for all policymakers. Congress and the president can choose to provide direct subsidies to employers for hiring. Such subsidies will increase the federal deficit, but they do have the power to increase “maximum employment” for the FOMC.\nConclusions\nLet me wrap up. The overarching theme of my speech has been monetary policy transparency. I pointed out that the FOMC has made major strides toward greater transparency in recent decades, and especially over the past two years. These steps mean that we are more accountable to the public and more effective as policymakers. It is especially noteworthy that in our January framework statement, the Committee has set a clear quantitative objective for our price stability mandate: 2 percent inflation per year.\nI believe that all Americans can take great pride in the improvements in FOMC communication over the past 15 or so years. But there is still more that can be done (of course!). Too often, our communications about the future course of the economy imply considerably more certainty than we can possible have. We should be more transparent about the uncertainties that we face as policymakers. We can and should use scenario analyses to describe how our policy will respond to new information about those uncertainties.\nAlong these lines, we can learn from the practices of other central banks. For example, in today’s talk, I spent a great deal of time discussing the uncertainties associated with formulating a quantitative measure of “maximum employment” for the FOMC. An interested Swedish citizen would have been able to read many rich and detailed discussions of exactly this issue in the Swedish central bank’s monetary policy reports in the mid-1990s.\nThanks for listening to my remarks. I’ll be happy to take your questions now on these or any other topic that might occur to you.\nEndnotes\n1 I thank Douglas Clement, David Fettig, Terry Fitzgerald, and Kei-Mu Yi for their contributions to these remarks.\n2 See the Jan. 25, 2012 press release.\n3 All U.S. data are from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Its job is to attain the maximum level of employment attainable through monetary policy, taking these other nonmonetary factors as given.\n\nIt is important to note that the long list of nonmonetary factors includes nonmonetary policies. It follows that, even if employment is close to the maximum level that is achievable using monetary policy, there may well be nonmonetary policy levers that could be used to raise employment still higher. For example, suppose that Congress and the president choose to reduce the payroll tax paid by employers. Such a move would provide an additional incentive to employers to hire more workers (albeit at the cost of increasing the deficit), and increase employment and reduce unemployment.\n\nAll of these nonmonetary factors, policy or otherwise, fluctuate over time. Their changes in turn generate fluctuations in the level of maximum employment achievable through monetary policy—fluctuations that are often hard to gauge on a real-time basis. In what follows, I will spend some time describing why I believe that the Committee currently faces an especially large amount of uncertainty about the level of maximum employment that it can hope to achieve.\n\nI’ll start by showing you graphs of four measures of the recent adverse changes in U.S. labor market performance. To understand the graphs, it’s helpful to recall that economists define the labor force to include all of those over 16 years of age who have a job or who have looked for a job in the past four weeks. All of the charts depict annual data through 2011.\n\nThe first graph depicts the evolution of the unemployment rate over time—the fraction of people in the labor force who have looked for a job in the past four weeks. The graph shows that after rising sharply from 2007 to 2009 (the shaded area indicates the recession period), the unemployment rate has been falling slowly.3\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge Image\n\nThe next graph shows the evolution of the employment/population ratio over time—the fraction of people who have a job. To eliminate some of the possible demographic shifts that might otherwise influence this picture, the graph focuses on people between 25 and 54 years old, the so-called prime age population for the job market. We can see a sharp decline in this ratio from 2007 to 2009. And, in contrast to the unemployment rate, there has been no noticeable recovery in this measure.\n\n\n\nLarge Image\n\nThe third graph is a depiction of the fraction of the population between ages 25 and 54 who are in the labor force—that is, they either have a job or have looked for one in the past month. Economists refer to this as the labor force participation rate. An interesting aspect of this graph is that this fraction has tended downward since the late 1990s. This downward path has accelerated since 2008.\n\n\n\nLarge Image\n\nThe final graph depicts the relationship of unfilled job openings and unemployment over time. The horizontal axis shows the unemployment rate. The vertical axis is the job openings or vacancy rate—the ratio of job openings to the sum of employment and job openings. Each point on this graph corresponds to a different year, and represents the average unemployment rate and the average vacancy rate in that year.\n\n\n\nLarge Image\n\nWhen the economy is doing well, firms usually hire more workers and they find it more challenging to fill their available openings. Hence, the unemployment rate is low, and the vacancy rate is high. So, typically, as the economy improves, the plotted points move toward the upper left in this picture. Conversely, when economic times get worse, the plotted points move to the southeast. This creates a curve that runs from the northwest to the southeast—a curve that’s known as the Beveridge curve.\n\nHowever, in the Great Recession and its aftermath, we have seen something different: The Beveridge curve itself has shifted out toward the upper right. Economists see this kind of outward shift as representing a decline in the ability of the labor market to form mutually beneficial matches between workers and firms. In that sense, the labor market is less efficient. The outward shift means that firms can’t fill their available job openings as readily as we would have expected in light of the high unemployment rate.\n\nTo summarize: Labor market outcomes do remain notably worse than prior to the recession. The good news is that the unemployment rate has been declining since the end of the recession. But there is also countervailing evidence: The labor force participation rate has been falling steadily, and the employment/population ratio remains near its low point. The Beveridge curve shows considerable deterioration in labor market matching efficiency.\n\nHow persistent will these changes in U.S. labor markets prove to be? Economists hold at least two views on this question. The first is guided by the patterns in post-World War II data for the United States. These patterns suggest that the current deterioration in U.S. labor market performance is indeed reversible under appropriate policy.\n\nThe second view is less sanguine. It says that the post-World War II data do not contain an economic crisis of the kind or magnitude that hit the United States in 2008. Such a crisis could well have a different kind of impact on labor markets than the earlier postwar recessions.\n\nThis latter view is also informed by data from other countries—not just the United States. My staff and I have recently taken a close look at data from Sweden.4 Why Sweden? In the early 1990s, Sweden was hit by a financial, banking, and currency crisis—what one might term a triple crisis. Of course, other industrialized countries—perhaps most notably Japan—have experienced these kinds of crises. My staff and I have focused on Sweden because it is generally viewed as having dealt with this triple crisis in a highly effective fashion. For example, in 2007, OECD economists wrote, “Sweden’s economy has made a remarkable recovery from the major crisis of the early 1990s,” in emphasizing Sweden’s rapid productivity growth in the previous two decades.5\n\nDespite this success, the triple crisis had a profound and highly persistent effect on the Swedish labor market. To see this, let’s look at graphs for the same four variables in Sweden that I showed you earlier for the United States.6 I’ve shaded the period 1991-93 in these graphs to indicate the heart of the triple crisis period in Sweden.\n\nThe first graph depicts the Swedish unemployment rate. From 1980 to 1990, the unemployment rate had never been above 4 percent and was typically closer to 2 percent. After 1993, the unemployment rate was never much below 6 percent.\n\n\n\nLarge Image\n\nThe second graph depicts the Swedish employment/population ratio, again for those between ages 25 and 54. From 1980 to 1990, the employment/population ratio grew steadily in Sweden and peaked at over 91 percent. After 1993, the ratio trended upward slightly but remained below 86 percent for most of the period.\n\n\n\nLarge Image\n\nNext, we see the evolution of the fraction of Swedes aged 25-54 years who are in the labor force. From 1980 to 1990, this fraction rose to a high of over 92 percent. After 1993, it was typically around 88 percent and never much above 90 percent.\n\n\n\nLarge Image\n\nFinally, we can look at the Beveridge curve—the joint evolution of unfilled job openings and unemployment. The Swedish Beveridge curve shifted outward from 1990 to 1995—and that shift has endured through at least 2010.\n\n\n\nLarge Image\n\nTo sum up: These four measures of Swedish labor market performance declined markedly after the triple crisis of the early 1990s. At least up until now, this decline has proved to be permanent. I should note too that these changes happened over a remarkably short span. In its February 1995 inflation report, the Riksbank, the Swedish central bank, suggests that the rate of unemployment that they viewed as sustainable over the long run had risen from 2-3 percent to 6 percent in less than five years.7 Their assessment—again, made in 1995—has proven to be a remarkably accurate characterization of how Swedish labor markets functioned over the next 15 years.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that, of course, there are many institutional differences between Sweden and the United States, especially in terms of tax systems and social safety nets. It would be a mistake to conclude from the Swedish data alone that the recent decline in U.S. labor market measures is inevitably a permanent one. But Sweden is not atypical. Cross-country research from Reinhart and Reinhart (2010) has found that financial crises tend to be followed by sustained increases in unemployment.8\n\nHence, I do think that the Swedish data—given that they come from a country generally regarded as an exemplar of how to handle a financial crisis—have to be viewed as informative. At a minimum, Sweden’s experience forces us to contemplate the possibility that the erosion in labor market performance that we’ve seen in the United States over the past five years may be highly persistent, even under appropriate monetary policy.\n\nOver the past ten minutes or so, I have talked about the recent adverse changes in U.S. labor market performance. I have discussed two sharply different possible ways to view those changes: first, that they are largely reversible under appropriate monetary policy and, second, that they are likely to be highly persistent. These two possibilities suggest that the FOMC is confronted with an unusually high degree of uncertainty about the level of “maximum employment” it can achieve. This uncertainty translates directly into a corresponding uncertainty about the appropriate approach to policy. In particular, policymakers who see the deterioration in labor market performance as reversible using monetary policy will typically favor more accommodative policy than those who view the deterioration as more protracted.\n\nFortunately, we can use other sources of information to reduce the level of uncertainty about the maximum level of employment achievable through monetary policy. “Maximum employment” for monetary policy is widely interpreted as the level of employment that is sustainable through monetary policy actions without an acceleration in inflation. While we cannot directly observe “maximum employment,” we do observe inflation, and its behavior is a useful signal of how close we are to the maximum level of employment achievable by the FOMC.\n\nSo, what has been happening with inflation? Inflation was distinctly higher in 2011 than in 2010. Even core measures of inflation, which strip out energy goods and services, and food, went up notably. I see these changes as a signal that our country’s current labor market performance is closer to “maximum employment,” given the tools available to the FOMC, than the post-World War II U.S. data alone would suggest. As I’ve argued in the past, appropriate monetary policy should be responsive to such signals.\n\nIt is worth reiterating a point that I made earlier. “Maximum employment” for monetary policy is not the same as “maximum employment” for all policymakers. Congress and the president can choose to provide direct subsidies to employers for hiring. Such subsidies will increase the federal deficit, but they do have the power to increase “maximum employment” for the FOMC.\n\nLet me wrap up. The overarching theme of my speech has been monetary policy transparency. I pointed out that the FOMC has made major strides toward greater transparency in recent decades, and especially over the past two years. These steps mean that we are more accountable to the public and more effective as policymakers. It is especially noteworthy that in our January framework statement, the Committee has set a clear quantitative objective for our price stability mandate: 2 percent inflation per year.\n\nI believe that all Americans can take great pride in the improvements in FOMC communication over the past 15 or so years. But there is still more that can be done (of course!). Too often, our communications about the future course of the economy imply considerably more certainty than we can possible have. We should be more transparent about the uncertainties that we face as policymakers. We can and should use scenario analyses to describe how our policy will respond to new information about those uncertainties.\n\nAlong these lines, we can learn from the practices of other central banks. For example, in today’s talk, I spent a great deal of time discussing the uncertainties associated with formulating a quantitative measure of “maximum employment” for the FOMC. An interested Swedish citizen would have been able to read many rich and detailed discussions of exactly this issue in the Swedish central bank’s monetary policy reports in the mid-1990s.\n\nThanks for listening to my remarks. I’ll be happy to take your questions now on these or any other topic that might occur to you."

            "content": "Note1\nThank you very much for that generous introduction. It is certainly a great honor to return to the Economic Club of Minnesota as a guest speaker to close out your 2011-2012 season—a season begun so auspiciously by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. All of us here today, and all of those across the state who come together for these events during the year, benefit from the work that you do at the Economic Club. So, my deepest thanks to you all for those efforts, and for inviting me here today.\nI became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis in October 2009. One of my main objectives since then has been to make both the Minneapolis Fed and the Federal Reserve System more open and transparent. And I’ve been delighted to learn that I’m not at all alone in this pursuit of greater openness. I see many positive developments along these lines throughout the System, and especially on the part of the Federal Open Market Committee. The FOMC, as you no doubt know, is the monetary policymaking arm of the Federal Reserve. It meets every six to seven weeks to chart the course of monetary policy. The members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 regional Feds, including me, all take part in these meetings.\nToday, I will talk about a significant improvement in the FOMC’s communication about monetary policy: In January 2012, the FOMC released a consensus statement describing its long-run framework. Congress has given the Federal Reserve a dual mandate: to promote maximum employment and to promote price stability. The January framework statement is important because it outlines the strategy that the FOMC follows in order to implement the FOMC’s dual mandate.\nAs you will hear, the framework statement provides a quantitative definition for price stability, through a numerical target for inflation. It does not do the same for maximum employment. I will spend a considerable amount of time discussing this latter aspect of the statement and its relevance for current policy.\nBefore proceeding, I’ll remind you that my remarks reflect my thoughts, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nA brief history of Fed transparency\nI’ll begin with some historical context. Over the past 30 years, central banks all over the world have become much more transparent about their objectives and how their current actions allow them to achieve those objectives. This transparency is widely viewed—by both policymakers and scholars—as an important means of enhancing the effectiveness of monetary policy.\nMost central banks aim to keep medium-term inflation low and stable—at around 2 percent annually. They have been quite successful in achieving that goal over the past 20 or 25 years. They view that success as being due in part to their communicating on an ongoing basis how their current policy actions are consistent with that goal.\nThere are at least two benefits of transparency. The first is broadly appreciated: By being clear about their objectives, central banks are better able to achieve those objectives. For example, if the central bank’s announced inflation target is 2 percent per year, firms and employees know that wages need to grow by 2 percent to keep up with the cost of living. That knowledge helps prevent wages from growing so fast that firms have to raise prices by more than 2 percent to cover their costs—and that in turn contributes to keeping inflation under control. In brief, then, transparency helps anchor inflation expectations.\nThe second benefit of transparency is less appreciated, but no less important. A transparent central bank is more accountable to the public because it is forced to be more disciplined in ensuring that its policy actions are in fact consistent with its policy objectives. The central bank knows the public will be able to track its performance. When performance matches words, the public will have an even stronger belief in the central bank, which serves to anchor inflation expectations more solidly.\nSo, there has been a trend toward central bank transparency internationally. What about here in the United States? I think we can all take pride in the fact that under Chairman Bernanke and his predecessor, Chairman Greenspan, the Fed has made enormous strides in transparency. It is easy to forget that, as recently as 1993, the FOMC would act and not tell anyone for 90 days! It was not until 2000 that the FOMC began issuing the statement that many of us now take for granted. And it was a decade ago that the roll call vote of FOMC members was added to the statement. Thus, there has been substantial progress in monetary policy transparency over the past 15 or so years.\nAs of the beginning of 2011, the Committee had arrived at three main forms of communication. First, immediately after every meeting, the Committee issues a carefully worded, but brief, statement intended to describe the current state of the economy and the current stance of monetary policy. Second, three weeks after each meeting, the Committee issues a carefully worded set of minutes that provide a longer, but still relatively high-level, description of interactions within the meeting. Third, after the January, April, June, and October/November meetings, the FOMC releases a summary of economic projections. Among other things, these quarterly releases contain information about FOMC meeting participants’ goals for medium-run inflation and unemployment (roughly, over the next five to six years).\nThe framework statement\nThere have been several changes in FOMC communications over the past year, including the introduction of regular press conferences by the chairman and the regular release of FOMC participants’ individual assessments of the appropriate path of short-term interest rates. But I want to spend my time today discussing the change that I view as the most important: the FOMC’s release in January 2012 of a five-paragraph statement describing its long-run framework.\nIt is important to be clear that the statement does not represent any change in the Committee’s approach to policy. However, it does represent a major step forward in the Committee’s communication of that approach to the public. In particular, I think of this statement as providing the basic principles of how the Committee implements its statutory dual mandate that monetary policy should promote price stability and maximum employment. I won’t go through the statement in any detail. Frankly, there is no need for me to do so: It is short and remarkably well-worded, and it deliberately shies away from technical language. I encourage all of you—indeed, all Americans—to read it when you have the opportunity.2\nWhat I will do instead is describe four aspects of the framework statement that I view as especially important. The first key aspect of the framework is that it specifically translates the term “price stability” into a 2 percent target for inflation. The American public need guess no longer about the Federal Reserve’s inflation intentions—either on the upside or on the downside: 2 percent is our goal.\nSecond, the framework describes how the Committee weighs the two mandates— promoting maximum employment and promoting price stability—against one another. Importantly, it stresses that the two mandates are typically complementary, in the sense that keeping unemployment from rising too high also keeps inflation from falling too low. I think that this point is often under-emphasized in popular discussions of monetary policy.\nThird, the framework enjoyed broad consensus support among meeting participants. This suggests that any changes in the framework will require the same level of broad consensus support. In this sense, one can think of the framework as being like a constitution.\nI have moved quickly through the first three of these key elements of the framework statement—inflation target of 2 percent, the typical complementarity of the two mandates, and the quasi-constitutionality of the statement. This fourth key feature of the statement is that while it provides a numerical target for inflation, it does not provide a similar explicit quantitative interpretation of the second mandate: “maximum employment.” I want to spend the rest of my time discussing why it does not do so.\nEstimating maximum employment\nI’ll start with a quote from the framework statement itself: “The maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the job market.” What are these nonmonetary factors? There are many, including population trends, the incentives built into the tax system, the incentives built into social insurance safety nets, the returns to human capital accumulation for young people, and simply social norms. All of these nonmonetary factors are hard to assess on a real-time basis, and they also change over time. Nonetheless, as the statement goes on to say, “The Committee’s policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the maximum level of employment, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision.”\nIn what follows, I will spend some time explaining why estimating maximum employment is particularly challenging right now. I’ll start by showing you graphs of four measures of the recent adverse changes in U.S. labor market performance. To understand the graphs, it’s helpful to recall that economists define the labor force to include all of those over 16 years of age who have a job or who have looked for a job in the past four weeks.\nThe first graph depicts the evolution of the unemployment rate over time—the fraction of people in the labor force who have looked for a job in the past four weeks. The graph shows that after rising sharply from 2007 to 2009 (the shaded area indicates the recession period), the unemployment rate has been falling slowly.3\nLarge Image\nThe next graph shows the evolution of the employment/population ratio over time—the fraction of people who have a job. To eliminate some of the possible demographic shifts that might otherwise influence this picture, the graph focuses on people between 25 and 54 years old, the so-called prime age population for the job market. We can see a sharp decline in this ratio from 2007 to 2009. And, in contrast to the unemployment rate, there has been no noticeable recovery in this measure.\nLarge Image\nThe third graph is a depiction of the fraction of the population between ages 25 and 54 who are in the labor force—that is, they either have a job or have looked for one in the past month. Economists refer to this as the labor force participation rate. An interesting aspect of this graph is that this fraction has tended downward since the late 1990s. This downward path has accelerated since 2008.\nLarge Image\nThe final graph depicts the relationship of unfilled job openings and unemployment over time. The horizontal axis shows the unemployment rate. The vertical axis is the job openings or vacancy rate—the ratio of job openings to the sum of employment and job openings. Each point on this graph corresponds to a different year, and represents the average unemployment rate and the average vacancy rate in that year.\nLarge Image\nWhen the economy is doing well, firms usually hire more workers and they find it more challenging to fill their available openings. Hence, the unemployment rate is low, and the vacancy rate is high. So, typically, as the economy improves, the plotted points move toward the upper left in this picture. Conversely, when economic times get worse, the plotted points move to the southeast. This creates a curve that runs from the northwest to the southeast—a curve that’s known as the Beveridge curve.\nHowever, in the Great Recession and its aftermath, we have seen something different: The Beveridge curve itself has shifted out toward the upper right. Economists see this kind of outward shift as representing a decline in the ability of the labor market to form mutually beneficial matches between workers and firms. In that sense, the labor market is less efficient. The outward shift means that firms can’t fill their available job openings as readily as we would have expected in light of the high unemployment rate.\nTo summarize: Labor market outcomes do remain notably worse than prior to the recession. The good news is that the unemployment rate has been declining since the end of the recession. But there is also countervailing evidence: The labor force participation rate has been falling steadily, and the employment/population ratio remains near its low point. The Beveridge curve shows considerable deterioration in labor market matching efficiency.\nHow persistent will these changes in U.S. labor markets prove to be?

Cross-country research from Reinhart and Reinhart (2010) has found that financial crises tend to be followed by sustained increases in unemployment.8\nHence, I do think that the Swedish data—given that they come from a country generally regarded as an exemplar of how to handle a financial crisis—have to be viewed as informative. At a minimum, Sweden’s experience forces us to contemplate the possibility that the erosion in labor market performance that we’ve seen in the United States over the past five years may be highly persistent, even under appropriate monetary policy.\nPolicy implications\nOver the past ten minutes or so, I have talked about the recent adverse changes in U.S. labor market performance. I have discussed two sharply different perspectives about those changes: first, that they are largely reversible under appropriate policy and, second, that they are likely to be highly persistent. These two distinct perspectives imply that FOMC meeting participants are confronted with an unusually wide range of possible quantitative interpretations of the words “maximum employment.”\nThese different quantitative interpretations have immediate policy implications. In particular, policymakers who see the deterioration in labor market performance as reversible using monetary policy will typically favor more accommodative policy than those who view the deterioration as more protracted.\nFor myself, I continue to pay close attention to the behavior of inflation. The term “maximum employment” in the statutory dual mandate is often interpreted as referring to the level of employment that is sustainable over the longer run without acceleration in inflation. Inflation was distinctly higher in 2011 than in 2010 and continues to run above the FOMC’s target of 2 percent.\nEven core measures of inflation, which strip out energy goods and services, and food, went up notably. I see these changes as a signal that our country’s current labor market performance is much closer to “maximum employment” than the post-World War II U.S. data alone would suggest. As I’ve argued in the past, appropriate policy should be responsive to such signals.\nConclusions\nWe should all take great ride in the improvements in FOMC communication over the past 15 or so years. But there is still more that can be done (of course!). My own view is that we need to do more to communicate the economic uncertainties that we face as policymakers and how our policymaking will respond to new information about those uncertainties. Here, we can learn much from the practices of other central banks. For example, in today’s talk, I spent a great deal of time discussing the uncertainties associated with formulating a quantitative measure of “maximum employment” for the FOMC. An interested Swedish citizen would have been able to read many rich and detailed discussions of exactly this issue in the Swedish central bank’s monetary policy reports in the mid-1990s.\nThanks for listening to my remarks. I’ll be happy to take your questions now on these or any other topic that might occur to you.\nEndnotes\n1 I thank Douglas Clement, David Fettig, Terry Fitzgerald, and Kei-Mu Yi for their contributions to these remarks.\n2 See the Jan. 25, 2012 press release.\n3 All U.S. data are from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

It is certainly a great honor to return to the Economic Club of Minnesota as a guest speaker to close out your 2011-2012 season—a season begun so auspiciously by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. All of us here today, and all of those across the state who come together for these events during the year, benefit from the work that you do at the Economic Club. So, my deepest thanks to you all for those efforts, and for inviting me here today.\n\nI became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis in October 2009. One of my main objectives since then has been to make both the Minneapolis Fed and the Federal Reserve System more open and transparent. And I’ve been delighted to learn that I’m not at all alone in this pursuit of greater openness. I see many positive developments along these lines throughout the System, and especially on the part of the Federal Open Market Committee. The FOMC, as you no doubt know, is the monetary policymaking arm of the Federal Reserve. It meets every six to seven weeks to chart the course of monetary policy. The members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 regional Feds, including me, all take part in these meetings.\n\nToday, I will talk about a significant improvement in the FOMC’s communication about monetary policy: In January 2012, the FOMC released a consensus statement describing its long-run framework. Congress has given the Federal Reserve a dual mandate: to promote maximum employment and to promote price stability. The January framework statement is important because it outlines the strategy that the FOMC follows in order to implement the FOMC’s dual mandate.\n\nAs you will hear, the framework statement provides a quantitative definition for price stability, through a numerical target for inflation. It does not do the same for maximum employment. I will spend a considerable amount of time discussing this latter aspect of the statement and its relevance for current policy.\n\nBefore proceeding, I’ll remind you that my remarks reflect my thoughts, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI’ll begin with some historical context. Over the past 30 years, central banks all over the world have become much more transparent about their objectives and how their current actions allow them to achieve those objectives. This transparency is widely viewed—by both policymakers and scholars—as an important means of enhancing the effectiveness of monetary policy.\n\nMost central banks aim to keep medium-term inflation low and stable—at around 2 percent annually. They have been quite successful in achieving that goal over the past 20 or 25 years. They view that success as being due in part to their communicating on an ongoing basis how their current policy actions are consistent with that goal.\n\nThere are at least two benefits of transparency. The first is broadly appreciated: By being clear about their objectives, central banks are better able to achieve those objectives. For example, if the central bank’s announced inflation target is 2 percent per year, firms and employees know that wages need to grow by 2 percent to keep up with the cost of living. That knowledge helps prevent wages from growing so fast that firms have to raise prices by more than 2 percent to cover their costs—and that in turn contributes to keeping inflation under control. In brief, then, transparency helps anchor inflation expectations.\n\nThe second benefit of transparency is less appreciated, but no less important. A transparent central bank is more accountable to the public because it is forced to be more disciplined in ensuring that its policy actions are in fact consistent with its policy objectives. The central bank knows the public will be able to track its performance. When performance matches words, the public will have an even stronger belief in the central bank, which serves to anchor inflation expectations more solidly.\n\nSo, there has been a trend toward central bank transparency internationally. What about here in the United States? I think we can all take pride in the fact that under Chairman Bernanke and his predecessor, Chairman Greenspan, the Fed has made enormous strides in transparency. It is easy to forget that, as recently as 1993, the FOMC would act and not tell anyone for 90 days! It was not until 2000 that the FOMC began issuing the statement that many of us now take for granted. And it was a decade ago that the roll call vote of FOMC members was added to the statement. Thus, there has been substantial progress in monetary policy transparency over the past 15 or so years.\n\nAs of the beginning of 2011, the Committee had arrived at three main forms of communication. First, immediately after every meeting, the Committee issues a carefully worded, but brief, statement intended to describe the current state of the economy and the current stance of monetary policy. Second, three weeks after each meeting, the Committee issues a carefully worded set of minutes that provide a longer, but still relatively high-level, description of interactions within the meeting. Third, after the January, April, June, and October/November meetings, the FOMC releases a summary of economic projections. Among other things, these quarterly releases contain information about FOMC meeting participants’ goals for medium-run inflation and unemployment (roughly, over the next five to six years).\n\nThere have been several changes in FOMC communications over the past year, including the introduction of regular press conferences by the chairman and the regular release of FOMC participants’ individual assessments of the appropriate path of short-term interest rates. But I want to spend my time today discussing the change that I view as the most important: the FOMC’s release in January 2012 of a five-paragraph statement describing its long-run framework.\n\nIt is important to be clear that the statement does not represent any change in the Committee’s approach to policy. However, it does represent a major step forward in the Committee’s communication of that approach to the public. In particular, I think of this statement as providing the basic principles of how the Committee implements its statutory dual mandate that monetary policy should promote price stability and maximum employment. I won’t go through the statement in any detail. Frankly, there is no need for me to do so: It is short and remarkably well-worded, and it deliberately shies away from technical language. I encourage all of you—indeed, all Americans—to read it when you have the opportunity.2\n\nWhat I will do instead is describe four aspects of the framework statement that I view as especially important. The first key aspect of the framework is that it specifically translates the term “price stability” into a 2 percent target for inflation. The American public need guess no longer about the Federal Reserve’s inflation intentions—either on the upside or on the downside: 2 percent is our goal.\n\nSecond, the framework describes how the Committee weighs the two mandates— promoting maximum employment and promoting price stability—against one another. Importantly, it stresses that the two mandates are typically complementary, in the sense that keeping unemployment from rising too high also keeps inflation from falling too low. I think that this point is often under-emphasized in popular discussions of monetary policy.\n\nThird, the framework enjoyed broad consensus support among meeting participants. This suggests that any changes in the framework will require the same level of broad consensus support. In this sense, one can think of the framework as being like a constitution.\n\nI have moved quickly through the first three of these key elements of the framework statement—inflation target of 2 percent, the typical complementarity of the two mandates, and the quasi-constitutionality of the statement. This fourth key feature of the statement is that while it provides a numerical target for inflation, it does not provide a similar explicit quantitative interpretation of the second mandate: “maximum employment.” I want to spend the rest of my time discussing why it does not do so.\n\nI’ll start with a quote from the framework statement itself: “The maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the job market.” What are these nonmonetary factors? There are many, including population trends, the incentives built into the tax system, the incentives built into social insurance safety nets, the returns to human capital accumulation for young people, and simply social norms. All of these nonmonetary factors are hard to assess on a real-time basis, and they also change over time. Nonetheless, as the statement goes on to say, “The Committee’s policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the maximum level of employment, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision.”\n\nIn what follows, I will spend some time explaining why estimating maximum employment is particularly challenging right now. I’ll start by showing you graphs of four measures of the recent adverse changes in U.S. labor market performance. To understand the graphs, it’s helpful to recall that economists define the labor force to include all of those over 16 years of age who have a job or who have looked for a job in the past four weeks.\n\nThe first graph depicts the evolution of the unemployment rate over time—the fraction of people in the labor force who have looked for a job in the past four weeks. The graph shows that after rising sharply from 2007 to 2009 (the shaded area indicates the recession period), the unemployment rate has been falling slowly.3\n\n\n\nLarge Image\n\n\n\nThe next graph shows the evolution of the employment/population ratio over time—the fraction of people who have a job. To eliminate some of the possible demographic shifts that might otherwise influence this picture, the graph focuses on people between 25 and 54 years old, the so-called prime age population for the job market. We can see a sharp decline in this ratio from 2007 to 2009. And, in contrast to the unemployment rate, there has been no noticeable recovery in this measure.\n\n\n\nLarge Image\n\n\n\nThe third graph is a depiction of the fraction of the population between ages 25 and 54 who are in the labor force—that is, they either have a job or have looked for one in the past month. Economists refer to this as the labor force participation rate. An interesting aspect of this graph is that this fraction has tended downward since the late 1990s. This downward path has accelerated since 2008.\n\n\n\nLarge Image\n\n\n\nThe final graph depicts the relationship of unfilled job openings and unemployment over time. The horizontal axis shows the unemployment rate. The vertical axis is the job openings or vacancy rate—the ratio of job openings to the sum of employment and job openings. Each point on this graph corresponds to a different year, and represents the average unemployment rate and the average vacancy rate in that year.\n\n\n\nLarge Image\n\n\n\nWhen the economy is doing well, firms usually hire more workers and they find it more challenging to fill their available openings. Hence, the unemployment rate is low, and the vacancy rate is high. So, typically, as the economy improves, the plotted points move toward the upper left in this picture. Conversely, when economic times get worse, the plotted points move to the southeast. This creates a curve that runs from the northwest to the southeast—a curve that’s known as the Beveridge curve.\n\nHowever, in the Great Recession and its aftermath, we have seen something different: The Beveridge curve itself has shifted out toward the upper right. Economists see this kind of outward shift as representing a decline in the ability of the labor market to form mutually beneficial matches between workers and firms. In that sense, the labor market is less efficient. The outward shift means that firms can’t fill their available job openings as readily as we would have expected in light of the high unemployment rate.\n\nTo summarize: Labor market outcomes do remain notably worse than prior to the recession. The good news is that the unemployment rate has been declining since the end of the recession. But there is also countervailing evidence: The labor force participation rate has been falling steadily, and the employment/population ratio remains near its low point. The Beveridge curve shows considerable deterioration in labor market matching efficiency.\n\nHow persistent will these changes in U.S. labor markets prove to be? Economists hold at least two views on this question. The first is guided by the patterns in post-World War II data for the United States. These patterns suggest that the current deterioration in U.S. labor market performance is indeed reversible under appropriate policy.\n\nThe second view is less sanguine. It says that the post-World War II data do not contain an economic crisis of the kind or magnitude that hit the United States in 2008. Such a crisis could well have a different kind of impact on labor markets than the earlier postwar recessions.\n\nThis latter view is also informed by data from other countries—not just the United States. My staff and I have recently taken a close look at data from Sweden.4 Why Sweden? In the early 1990s, Sweden was hit by a financial, banking, and currency crisis—what one might term a triple crisis. Of course, other industrialized countries—perhaps most notably Japan—have experienced these kinds of crises. My staff and I have focused on Sweden because it is generally viewed as having dealt with this triple crisis in a highly effective fashion. For example, in 2007, OECD economists wrote, “Sweden’s economy has made a remarkable recovery from the major crisis of the early 1990s,” in emphasizing Sweden’s rapid productivity growth in the previous two decades.5\n\nDespite this success, the triple crisis had a profound and highly persistent effect on the Swedish labor market. To see this, let’s look at graphs for the same four variables in Sweden that I showed you earlier for the United States.6 I’ve shaded the period 1991-93 in these graphs to indicate the heart of the triple crisis period in Sweden.\n\nThe first graph depicts the Swedish unemployment rate. From 1980 to 1990, the unemployment rate had never been above 4 percent and was typically closer to 2 percent. After 1993, the unemployment rate was never much below 6 percent.\n\n\n\nLarge Image\n\n\n\nThe second graph depicts the Swedish employment/population ratio, again for those between ages 25 and 54. From 1980 to 1990, the employment/population ratio grew steadily in Sweden and peaked at over 91 percent. After 1993, the ratio trended upward slightly but remained below 86 percent for most of the period.\n\n\n\nLarge Image\n\n\n\nNext, we see the evolution of the fraction of Swedes aged 25-54 years who are in the labor force. From 1980 to 1990, this fraction rose to a high of over 92 percent. After 1993, it was typically around 88 percent and never much above 90 percent.\n\n\n\nLarge Image\n\n\n\nFinally, we can look at the Beveridge curve—the joint evolution of unfilled job openings and unemployment. The Swedish Beveridge curve shifted outward from 1990 to 1995—and that shift has endured through at least 2010.\n\n\n\nLarge Image\n\n\n\nTo sum up: These four measures of Swedish labor market performance declined markedly after the triple crisis of the early 1990s. At least up until now, this decline has proved to be permanent. I should note too that these changes happened over a remarkably short span. In its February 1995 inflation report, the Riksbank, the Swedish central bank, suggests that the rate of unemployment that they viewed as sustainable over the long run had risen from 2-3 percent to 6 percent in less than five years.7 Their assessment—again, made in 1995—has proven to be a remarkably accurate characterization of how Swedish labor markets functioned over the next 15 years.\n\nOf course, there are many institutional differences between Sweden and the United States, especially in terms of tax systems and social safety nets. It would be a mistake to conclude from the Swedish data alone that the recent decline in U.S. labor market measures is inevitably a permanent one. But Sweden is not atypical. Cross-country research from Reinhart and Reinhart (2010) has found that financial crises tend to be followed by sustained increases in unemployment.8\n\nHence, I do think that the Swedish data—given that they come from a country generally regarded as an exemplar of how to handle a financial crisis—have to be viewed as informative. At a minimum, Sweden’s experience forces us to contemplate the possibility that the erosion in labor market performance that we’ve seen in the United States over the past five years may be highly persistent, even under appropriate monetary policy.\n\nOver the past ten minutes or so, I have talked about the recent adverse changes in U.S. labor market performance. I have discussed two sharply different perspectives about those changes: first, that they are largely reversible under appropriate policy and, second, that they are likely to be highly persistent. These two distinct perspectives imply that FOMC meeting participants are confronted with an unusually wide range of possible quantitative interpretations of the words “maximum employment.”\n\nThese different quantitative interpretations have immediate policy implications. In particular, policymakers who see the deterioration in labor market performance as reversible using monetary policy will typically favor more accommodative policy than those who view the deterioration as more protracted.\n\nFor myself, I continue to pay close attention to the behavior of inflation. The term “maximum employment” in the statutory dual mandate is often interpreted as referring to the level of employment that is sustainable over the longer run without acceleration in inflation. Inflation was distinctly higher in 2011 than in 2010 and continues to run above the FOMC’s target of 2 percent.\n\nEven core measures of inflation, which strip out energy goods and services, and food, went up notably. I see these changes as a signal that our country’s current labor market performance is much closer to “maximum employment” than the post-World War II U.S. data alone would suggest. As I’ve argued in the past, appropriate policy should be responsive to such signals.\n\nWe should all take great ride in the improvements in FOMC communication over the past 15 or so years. But there is still more that can be done (of course!). My own view is that we need to do more to communicate the economic uncertainties that we face as policymakers and how our policymaking will respond to new information about those uncertainties.

            "content": "Note1\nIntroduction\nThank you for that generous introduction, and thank you especially for the invitation to join you here today at the 2012 Business Law Institute. I often tell people when I give a talk that I look forward to taking their questions at the end of my speech. As a policymaker, I think that it’s a great way for me to find out what people have on their minds. But today, I’m not so sure. A room full of lawyers—all trained in the fine art of cross-examination—is a bit more intimidating. But lawyer jokes aside—I do look forward to your questions, both on what I have to say today and whatever else is on your mind regarding the Federal Reserve.\nI became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis in October 2009. One of my main objectives since then has been to make both the Minneapolis Fed and the Federal Reserve System more open and transparent. And I’ve been delighted to learn that I’m not at all alone in this pursuit. I see many positive developments along these lines throughout the System.\nI’ll spend the first part of my remarks providing some background about the functioning of the Federal Open Market Committee—the monetary policymaking arm of the Federal Reserve. Then I will talk about three recent and significant improvements in the FOMC’s communication about monetary policy. I’ll wrap up with a brief discussion of why these improvements have occurred recently and then open the floor for your questions.\nLet me give you a quick preview of those recent changes in communication, which I’ll describe in greater depth in a few minutes. The first change is that, after four of the regularly scheduled eight meetings it holds each year, the FOMC now releases the meeting participants’ assessments of the evolution of future policy. The second is that after those same four meetings, the chairman of the FOMC now gives a press conference. And the third improvement in FOMC communication is that, in January 2012, the Committee released a consensus statement describing its long-run framework.\nThe first two changes have received considerable attention from the media and the public. However, I’ll spend most of my time today discussing the third item—the framework statement. Press reports on the FOMC often highlight apparent differences of opinion on policy among meeting participants. In contrast, the framework statement that we released in January is important because it details the common principles regarding goals and strategy that shape FOMC decision-making.\nBefore proceeding further, I’ll remind you that my remarks today reflect my thoughts, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nFOMC basics\nTo help you understand the significance of these changes, I’ll start by providing some basic background on the structure and operation of the Federal Reserve System. I like to tell people that the Fed is a uniquely American institution. What do I mean by that? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts and includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to set the course of monetary policy. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. (Actually, right now, there are only five governors—two positions are unfilled.) However, the Committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and a rotating group of four other presidents (currently Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco). I was on the Committee in 2011, and I’ll be on it again in 2014. In this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government, because representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations.\nI consider this federalist structure important because it fosters valuable two-way communication between Americans and their central bank—exactly the kind of two-way communication that we’re engaging in right here. Of course, one direction of communication is from regional Fed presidents to the residents of their districts. But the other direction matters a lot too, because the input from the presidents to the FOMC relies critically on information we receive from our districts about local economic performance.\nBackground on FOMC communication\nI now want to turn to the recent changes in FOMC communications. I’ll begin with some historical context. Over the past 30 years, central banks all over the world have become much more transparent about their objectives and how their current actions allow them to achieve those objectives. This transparency is widely viewed—by both policymakers and scholars—as an important means of enhancing the effectiveness of monetary policy.\nMost central banks aim to keep medium-term inflation low and stable—at around 2 percent annually. They have been quite successful in achieving that goal over the past 20 or 25 years. They view that success as being due in part to their communicating on an ongoing basis how their current policy actions are consistent with that goal.\nThere are at least two benefits of transparency. The first is broadly appreciated: By being clear about their objectives, central banks are better able to achieve those objectives. For example, if the central bank’s announced inflation target is 2 percent per year, firms and employees know that wages need to grow by 2 percent to keep up with the cost of living. That knowledge helps prevent wages from growing so fast that firms have to raise prices by more than 2 percent to cover their costs—and that in turn contributes to keeping inflation under control. In brief, then, transparency helps anchor inflation expectations.\nThe second benefit of transparency is less appreciated, but no less important. A transparent central bank is more accountable to the public because it is forced to be more disciplined in ensuring that its policy actions are in fact consistent with its policy objectives. The central bank knows the public will be able to track its performance. When performance matches words, the public will have an even stronger belief in the central bank, which serves to anchor inflation expectations more solidly.\nSo, there has been a trend toward central bank transparency internationally. What about here in the United States? I think we can all take pride in the fact that under Chairman Bernanke and his predecessor, Chairman Greenspan, the Fed has made enormous strides in transparency. It is easy to forget that, as recently as 1993, the FOMC would act and not tell anyone for 90 days! It was not until 2000 that the FOMC began issuing the statement that many of us now take for granted. And it was a decade ago that the roll call vote of FOMC members was added to the statement. Thus, there has been substantial progress in monetary policy transparency over the past 15 or so years.\nAs of the beginning of 2011, the Committee had arrived at three main forms of communication. First, immediately after every meeting, the Committee issues a carefully worded, but brief, statement intended to describe the current state of the economy and to describe the current stance of monetary policy. Second, three weeks after each meeting, the Committee issues a carefully worded set of minutes that provide a longer, but still relatively high-level, description of interactions within the meeting. Third, after the January, April, June, and October/November meetings, the FOMC releases a summary of economic projections. Among other things, these quarterly releases contain information about FOMC meeting participants’ goals for medium-run inflation and unemployment (roughly, over the next five to six years).\nCommunication changes\nWith that backdrop, let me turn to the communication changes that have taken place over the past year. I’ll start with the release of information about FOMC meeting participants’ assessments of future policy. To appreciate this change, it is important to recall that the current stimulative impact of monetary policy relies critically on people’s expectations of future monetary policy actions. Monetary policy operates by affecting interest rates. If people expect short-term interest rates to stay low for a long period of time, longer-term interest rates—like those on three-year car loans—also will tend to be low, other things equal. People will borrow more to finance consumption, and firms will borrow more to undertake investment.\nSo, the impact of current policy depends not just on how low interest rates currently are, but also on how long interest rates are expected to remain low. To help shape those expectations, the Committee decided in January to release, on a quarterly basis, a summary of meeting participants’ evaluations of the appropriate evolution of future policy. In particular, the release includes the participants’ current assessments about the appropriate setting for the year-end fed funds rate in 2012, 2013, and 2014, as well as their judgments about the appropriate year of the first increase in the fed funds rate.2\nHere, I should stress that these assessments are not forecasts of what policy will be. They are judgments about what appropriate policy should be. Different meeting participants might well have different views about the evolution of economic conditions, and about how monetary policy should respond to those conditions. Those differences in viewpoints will be incorporated into their assessments of when interest rates should be raised or lowered. Thus, the recent release of these policy assessments in April showed that some participants anticipated that it would be appropriate to raise rates by the end of this year. Others anticipated that it would be appropriate to wait until at least 2015 to do so.\nThe policy assessments represent individual views, and so this creates the possibility of a conflict between the information in the policy assessments and the Committee’s policy statement issued at the end of each meeting. As Chairman Bernanke has pointed out, the policy assessments are but one of many inputs into the policy process. In his words, the FOMC statement “trumps” whatever information is in the policy assessments themselves.\nThese releases about FOMC meeting participants’ policy assessments will be part of the Committee’s quarterly releases of its economic projections that take place after the January, April, June, and October/November meetings.\nLet me turn to the second of the three recent communication innovations. Beginning last April, the FOMC made a major step toward transparency by deciding to have the chairman hold a press conference after each of these quarterly meetings. These press conferences allow the chairman to explain the Committee’s actions in ways that a short written document cannot. He has more time and more words at his disposal. He can respond directly to concerns or questions about the Committee’s actions. Overall, the press conferences allow the Committee to be more effective by explaining its actions more clearly and, of course, to be more accountable to the public for those actions.\nThere have now been five press conferences, and I think that they have been remarkably successful. In no small part, I see that success as being directly attributable to Chairman Bernanke’s particular gift for exposition.\nThe framework statement\nFinally, I want to discuss the third and most important change in communication that has taken place in the past year or so: the FOMC’s release in January 2012 of a five-paragraph statement describing its long-run framework. The statement does not represent any change in the Committee’s approach to policy, but it does represent a major step forward in the Committee’s communication of that approach to the public. In particular, I think of this statement as providing the basic principles of how the Committee implements its statutory dual mandate that monetary policy should promote price stability and maximum employment. I won’t go through the statement in any detail. Frankly, there is no need for me to do so: It is short and remarkably well-worded, and it deliberately shies away from technical language. I encourage all of you—indeed, all Americans—to read it when you have the opportunity.3\nWhat I will do instead is describe four aspects of the framework statement that I view as especially important. The first key aspect of the framework is that it specifically translates the term “price stability” into a 2 percent target for inflation. The American public need guess no longer about the Federal Reserve’s inflation intentions—either on the upside or on the downside: 2 percent is our goal.\nSecond, the framework describes how the Committee weighs the two mandates—promoting maximum employment and promoting price stability—against one another. Importantly, it stresses that the two mandates are typically complementary, in the sense that keeping unemployment from rising too high also keeps inflation from falling too low. I think that this point is often underemphasized in popular discussions of monetary policy.\nThird, the framework enjoyed broad consensus support among meeting participants. Hence, this suggests that any changes in the framework will require the same level of broad consensus support. In this sense, one can think of the framework as being like a constitution.\nThe fourth key feature is that while the statement provides a numerical target for inflation, it does not provide a similar explicit quantitative interpretation of the second mandate: “maximum employment.” As the statement itself says, “The maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the job market.” What are these nonmonetary factors? There are many, including population trends, the incentives built into the tax system, the incentives built into social insurance safety nets, the returns to human capital accumulation for young people, and simply social norms.\nAll of these nonmonetary factors are hard to assess on a real-time basis, and they also change over time. Nonetheless, as the framework statement goes on to say, “The Committee’s policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the maximum level of employment, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision.” Different assessments will inevitably lead to differences in thinking about policy. If one monetary policymaker sees the level of “maximum employment” as being higher than another, then the first policymaker will typically favor more accommodative monetary policy than the latter.\nConclusions\nLet me wrap up. We have seen three major changes in FOMC communication in less than one year’s time. Why have there been so many changes in such a short period? I think there are two reasons. One is that as an intellectual and as a policymaker, Chairman Bernanke has long been dedicated to the proposition that transparency and clarity are essential to the making of good monetary policy. His central vision has been an essential force behind these recent steps.\nThe other reason has to do with the current state of policy. Right now, the FOMC is targeting a fed funds rate of between 0 and 25 basis points—that is, 0 to 0.25 percentage points. The rate can’t get any lower. But one way to vary monetary stimulus today is to influence the public’s expectations of how long the fed funds rate will stay so low—and how fast the fed funds rate will rise when it does start to rise. Thus, communication, while always important, is especially so today.\nWhile I think that we should all take great pride in the recent improvements in FOMC communication, there is still more that can be done (of course!). In prior speeches, I have spoken about the need for a public contingency plan on the part of the FOMC. Such a plan would provide clarity in two important ways. First, it would allow the public to know the kind of scenarios—both surprisingly positive and surprisingly negative—under consideration by the Committee. Second, it would inform the public about how the Committee plans to react to those scenarios.\nThanks for listening to my remarks. I’ll be happy to take your questions now on these or any other topic that might occur to you.\nEndnotes\n1 I thank Douglas Clement, David Fettig, Terry Fitzgerald, and Kei-Mu Yi for their contributions to these remarks.\n2 Federal funds, or fed funds, are unsecured loans of reserve balances at Federal Reserve Banks that depository institutions make to one another. The rate at which these transactions occur is called the fed funds rate.\n3 For convenience, here again is a link to the statement.\n\nNote1\n\nThank you for that generous introduction, and thank you especially for the invitation to join you here today at the 2012 Business Law Institute. I often tell people when I give a talk that I look forward to taking their questions at the end of my speech. As a policymaker, I think that it’s a great way for me to find out what people have on their minds. But today, I’m not so sure. A room full of lawyers—all trained in the fine art of cross-examination—is a bit more intimidating. But lawyer jokes aside—I do look forward to your questions, both on what I have to say today and whatever else is on your mind regarding the Federal Reserve.\n\nI became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis in October 2009. One of my main objectives since then has been to make both the Minneapolis Fed and the Federal Reserve System more open and transparent. And I’ve been delighted to learn that I’m not at all alone in this pursuit. I see many positive developments along these lines throughout the System.\n\nI’ll spend the first part of my remarks providing some background about the functioning of the Federal Open Market Committee—the monetary policymaking arm of the Federal Reserve. Then I will talk about three recent and significant improvements in the FOMC’s communication about monetary policy. I’ll wrap up with a brief discussion of why these improvements have occurred recently and then open the floor for your questions.\n\nLet me give you a quick preview of those recent changes in communication, which I’ll describe in greater depth in a few minutes. The first change is that, after four of the regularly scheduled eight meetings it holds each year, the FOMC now releases the meeting participants’ assessments of the evolution of future policy. The second is that after those same four meetings, the chairman of the FOMC now gives a press conference. And the third improvement in FOMC communication is that, in January 2012, the Committee released a consensus statement describing its long-run framework.\n\nThe first two changes have received considerable attention from the media and the public. However, I’ll spend most of my time today discussing the third item—the framework statement. Press reports on the FOMC often highlight apparent differences of opinion on policy among meeting participants. In contrast, the framework statement that we released in January is important because it details the common principles regarding goals and strategy that shape FOMC decision-making.\n\nBefore proceeding further, I’ll remind you that my remarks today reflect my thoughts, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nTo help you understand the significance of these changes, I’ll start by providing some basic background on the structure and operation of the Federal Reserve System. I like to tell people that the Fed is a uniquely American institution. What do I mean by that? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts and includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\n\nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to set the course of monetary policy. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. (Actually, right now, there are only five governors—two positions are unfilled.) However, the Committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and a rotating group of four other presidents (currently Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco). I was on the Committee in 2011, and I’ll be on it again in 2014. In this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government, because representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations.\n\nI consider this federalist structure important because it fosters valuable two-way communication between Americans and their central bank—exactly the kind of two-way communication that we’re engaging in right here. Of course, one direction of communication is from regional Fed presidents to the residents of their districts. But the other direction matters a lot too, because the input from the presidents to the FOMC relies critically on information we receive from our districts about local economic performance.\n\nI now want to turn to the recent changes in FOMC communications. I’ll begin with some historical context. Over the past 30 years, central banks all over the world have become much more transparent about their objectives and how their current actions allow them to achieve those objectives. This transparency is widely viewed—by both policymakers and scholars—as an important means of enhancing the effectiveness of monetary policy.\n\nMost central banks aim to keep medium-term inflation low and stable—at around 2 percent annually. They have been quite successful in achieving that goal over the past 20 or 25 years. They view that success as being due in part to their communicating on an ongoing basis how their current policy actions are consistent with that goal.\n\nThere are at least two benefits of transparency. The first is broadly appreciated: By being clear about their objectives, central banks are better able to achieve those objectives. For example, if the central bank’s announced inflation target is 2 percent per year, firms and employees know that wages need to grow by 2 percent to keep up with the cost of living. That knowledge helps prevent wages from growing so fast that firms have to raise prices by more than 2 percent to cover their costs—and that in turn contributes to keeping inflation under control. In brief, then, transparency helps anchor inflation expectations.\n\nThe second benefit of transparency is less appreciated, but no less important. A transparent central bank is more accountable to the public because it is forced to be more disciplined in ensuring that its policy actions are in fact consistent with its policy objectives. The central bank knows the public will be able to track its performance. When performance matches words, the public will have an even stronger belief in the central bank, which serves to anchor inflation expectations more solidly.\n\nSo, there has been a trend toward central bank transparency internationally. What about here in the United States? I think we can all take pride in the fact that under Chairman Bernanke and his predecessor, Chairman Greenspan, the Fed has made enormous strides in transparency. It is easy to forget that, as recently as 1993, the FOMC would act and not tell anyone for 90 days! It was not until 2000 that the FOMC began issuing the statement that many of us now take for granted. And it was a decade ago that the roll call vote of FOMC members was added to the statement. Thus, there has been substantial progress in monetary policy transparency over the past 15 or so years.\n\nAs of the beginning of 2011, the Committee had arrived at three main forms of communication. First, immediately after every meeting, the Committee issues a carefully worded, but brief, statement intended to describe the current state of the economy and to describe the current stance of monetary policy. Second, three weeks after each meeting, the Committee issues a carefully worded set of minutes that provide a longer, but still relatively high-level, description of interactions within the meeting. Third, after the January, April, June, and October/November meetings, the FOMC releases a summary of economic projections. Among other things, these quarterly releases contain information about FOMC meeting participants’ goals for medium-run inflation and unemployment (roughly, over the next five to six years).\n\nWith that backdrop, let me turn to the communication changes that have taken place over the past year. I’ll start with the release of information about FOMC meeting participants’ assessments of future policy. To appreciate this change, it is important to recall that the current stimulative impact of monetary policy relies critically on people’s expectations of future monetary policy actions. Monetary policy operates by affecting interest rates. If people expect short-term interest rates to stay low for a long period of time, longer-term interest rates—like those on three-year car loans—also will tend to be low, other things equal. People will borrow more to finance consumption, and firms will borrow more to undertake investment.\n\nSo, the impact of current policy depends not just on how low interest rates currently are, but also on how long interest rates are expected to remain low. To help shape those expectations, the Committee decided in January to release, on a quarterly basis, a summary of meeting participants’ evaluations of the appropriate evolution of future policy. In particular, the release includes the participants’ current assessments about the appropriate setting for the year-end fed funds rate in 2012, 2013, and 2014, as well as their judgments about the appropriate year of the first increase in the fed funds rate.2\n\nHere, I should stress that these assessments are not forecasts of what policy will be. They are judgments about what appropriate policy should be. Different meeting participants might well have different views about the evolution of economic conditions, and about how monetary policy should respond to those conditions. Those differences in viewpoints will be incorporated into their assessments of when interest rates should be raised or lowered. Thus, the recent release of these policy assessments in April showed that some participants anticipated that it would be appropriate to raise rates by the end of this year. Others anticipated that it would be appropriate to wait until at least 2015 to do so.\n\nThe policy assessments represent individual views, and so this creates the possibility of a conflict between the information in the policy assessments and the Committee’s policy statement issued at the end of each meeting. As Chairman Bernanke has pointed out, the policy assessments are but one of many inputs into the policy process. In his words, the FOMC statement “trumps” whatever information is in the policy assessments themselves.\n\nThese releases about FOMC meeting participants’ policy assessments will be part of the Committee’s quarterly releases of its economic projections that take place after the January, April, June, and October/November meetings.\n\nLet me turn to the second of the three recent communication innovations. Beginning last April, the FOMC made a major step toward transparency by deciding to have the chairman hold a press conference after each of these quarterly meetings. These press conferences allow the chairman to explain the Committee’s actions in ways that a short written document cannot. He has more time and more words at his disposal. He can respond directly to concerns or questions about the Committee’s actions. Overall, the press conferences allow the Committee to be more effective by explaining its actions more clearly and, of course, to be more accountable to the public for those actions.\n\nThere have now been five press conferences, and I think that they have been remarkably successful. In no small part, I see that success as being directly attributable to Chairman Bernanke’s particular gift for exposition.\n\nFinally, I want to discuss the third and most important change in communication that has taken place in the past year or so: the FOMC’s release in January 2012 of a five-paragraph statement describing its long-run framework. The statement does not represent any change in the Committee’s approach to policy, but it does represent a major step forward in the Committee’s communication of that approach to the public. In particular, I think of this statement as providing the basic principles of how the Committee implements its statutory dual mandate that monetary policy should promote price stability and maximum employment. I won’t go through the statement in any detail. Frankly, there is no need for me to do so: It is short and remarkably well-worded, and it deliberately shies away from technical language. I encourage all of you—indeed, all Americans—to read it when you have the opportunity.3\n\nWhat I will do instead is describe four aspects of the framework statement that I view as especially important. The first key aspect of the framework is that it specifically translates the term “price stability” into a 2 percent target for inflation. The American public need guess no longer about the Federal Reserve’s inflation intentions—either on the upside or on the downside: 2 percent is our goal.\n\nSecond, the framework describes how the Committee weighs the two mandates—promoting maximum employment and promoting price stability—against one another.

            "content": "Note1\nGood morning, and welcome to Washington, D.C., and the home of the Federal Reserve System’s Board of Governors. Actually, I am a guest here myself. My own home base is the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, one of 12 independently managed Federal Reserve Banks whose districts span the country. I’m delighted to see so many people joining in this conversation today. I think I speak for all of us here when I thank the staff at the Board of Governors for graciously hosting this event. I should note that the following views are my own, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve.\nI just mentioned the Federal Reserve System’s regional structure. This structure, in place for nearly 100 years now, was established by Congress for a very deliberate reason. Congress wanted to ensure that the nation’s central bank keeps in touch with economic issues at the grass-roots level across the United States. The Fed benefits greatly from this regional structure and the community access it allows.\nIn our critical monetary policy responsibilities, it helps us understand how economic policies affect Main Street as well as Wall Street. In our financial supervision and regulation responsibilities, it gives us a window into the operations and impact of the entire financial system, from global giants to local banks. In our role as a provider of payments services to the public and the U.S. Treasury, it allows us to perceive and respond quickly to changes in technology and demand. Finally, the Federal Reserve’s decentralized structure also helps us monitor and respond to regional economic issues affecting low- and moderate-income communities, including Native American reservations, through our Community Development departments.\nThe Federal Reserve System made good use of this regional structure last year, when it co-sponsored six Growing Economies in Indian Country workshops across the country. Community Development staff at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the Reserve Banks of Minneapolis, Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco helped organize these well-attended and thought-provoking events. Our invaluable partners in this effort included nine federal agencies and numerous national, local, and tribal organizations and individuals.\nTwo crucial differences that shape Indian Country development\nToday we gather to discuss and respond to the concerns and recommendations that were voiced at those workshops. We’re honored to have a number of distinguished presenters who will address issues raised separately or commonly at the six forums. Before we hear from them, however, I hope you’ll allow me a few minutes to offer some thoughts on economic development in Indian Country.\nMy ideas have clearly been influenced by the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank’s work in this area. For the past 20 years, our Community Development department has worked from the ground up with tribal and private sector leaders in Indian Country to strengthen the institutional foundation for economic growth on reservations. Most notably, they have helped develop and implement secured transactions laws and related initiatives. The aim of these efforts: to facilitate the flow of credit and entrepreneurial opportunities on reservations.\nToday we will be hearing many additional ideas for institutional and policy reforms that may enhance economic development in Indian Country. I will try to frame our discussion by asking what I hope is a clarifying question: How does Indian Country economic development differ from rural economic development more generally? I realize that a number of reservations and homelands are in or near urban areas. Nonetheless, I think that the rural location of many of the larger and poorer reservations justifies a comparison between Indian Country and rural development. And I should say that by “Indian Country,” I mean the self-governing Native American and Alaska Native communities and reservations throughout the United States, as recognized in federal law.\nMy thinking will be guided by a crucial assumption. In particular, I assume that Indian Country residents and leaders place a high value on preserving their native cultures and their tribal sovereignty. This statement may seem obvious to most of you, but I will argue that it clarifies what is special—and perhaps unique—about Indian Country economic development.\nThe goal of preserving tribal cultures and sovereignty creates two key differences between rural economic development in general and Indian Country economic development in particular. One difference involves the often painful and disruptive process of population loss through out-migration. Despite such costs, large-scale out-migration from poor rural regions has been a major force for poverty reduction around the globe. But in Indian Country, it is an especially unattractive option, because population loss would threaten the viability of the tribe as a distinct cultural entity. Heightened resistance to out-migration is therefore a special characteristic of economic development in Indian Country.\nThe second important difference arises from the distinctive legal arrangements required to maintain meaningful tribal political sovereignty. The most prominent example is a topic we will hear more about today—special restrictions on the ownership of land that are necessary to preserve the reservation land base. Although critical for maintaining tribal sovereignty, Indian Country’s special restrictions on land ownership raise economic development issues that are rarely encountered in other rural economies. In Indian Country, therefore, conventional thinking about rural development needs to be adjusted for two special factors—population retention and restrictions on land ownership. Many of the issues we are discussing today deal, directly or indirectly, with how to make the required adjustments to our thinking.\nI hasten to add that I offer my views with a great deal of humility and an open mind. Unlike almost everyone else in the room, I am not an expert on Indian Country. Nor am I here to tell you what needs to be done. I speak as an economist and as a Federal Reserve Bank president with concerns for his district. I hope you will find my comments useful in organizing your own thinking today and perhaps in the future. By the same token, I look forward to hearing your views and refining my own thinking through our dialogue. Please note that, to simplify my discussion, I will hereafter focus my remarks on Native Americans and their reservations. These are the peoples and geographies I am most familiar with in the Minneapolis Federal Reserve district. I ask the audience to make appropriate adaptations of my language to apply, where relevant, to other Indian Country geographies and peoples as well.\nThe economic gap\nToday, as you know, Native Americans on reservations continue to face economic disadvantages relative to other Americans. For example, the American Community Survey assesses the employment status of working-age individuals, defined as 16 years and older. From 2006 through 2010, just over 45 percent of working-age Native Americans on reservations were employed, compared with almost 60 percent of all working-age Americans. Partly as a result, the median annual income among Native American households on a typical reservation was under $35,000 during that period. This compared with $52,000 for all American households and about $37,000 for all Native American households, on and off reservations. As a further consequence, about 25 percent of the Native Americans on reservations lived in households with incomes below the official poverty level during this period, compared with 14 percent of Americans overall.\nThese gaps are even larger on more remote reservations, including several in my district. Consider, for example, North Dakota’s portion of the Standing Rock Reservation, which exactly coincides with Sioux County, North Dakota. For 2006 through 2010, about 84 percent of Sioux County’s residents were Native American. On average, over this period, just 37 percent of the working-age Native Americans in Sioux County were employed. This contributed to a median household income of only $31,000 and a 47 percent poverty rate for Native Americans in Sioux County during these years. Again, this is compared with $52,000 for all American households and a 14 percent poverty rate for all Americans.\nOf course, it may not be fair to compare a very rural location, like Sioux County, with national averages heavily weighted toward major metropolitan areas. However, Sioux County still lags significantly when compared with rural nonreservation counties, even its immediate neighbor, Grant County, North Dakota. Grant County is equally rural and remote, but its population is 97 percent white. Almost 62 percent of its working-age population was employed during the 2006-2010 period. Higher employment helped households there earn a median income of almost $37,000, more than 25 percent higher than the Native American households in Sioux County. Only about 13 percent of Grant County residents lived in poverty during 2006-2010.\nBy these very basic economic measures, therefore, Sioux County’s Native Americans lagged well behind other Americans not only nationally, but also just next door in Grant County. To be sure, not all reservations fit this pattern, especially those with small populations and gaming operations located near major metropolitan areas. Nonetheless, the economic gaps between Sioux County and Grant County, North Dakota, are not uncommon among the large reservations in remote rural areas. Our conversations today will largely focus on how to close those gaps.\nA success that points to one distinctive feature: Retaining population\nThe economic gaps I’ve just cited may not tell the whole story about Sioux and Grant counties and the many other rural reservation and nonreservation areas like them. As I mentioned, population retention is of fundamental importance to Native American tribes. By that measure, Sioux County has been significantly more successful than Grant County.\nBetween 2000 and 2010, Sioux County’s population grew by over 2 percent, while Grant County’s population dropped by almost 16 percent. Other nearby counties with mostly white rural residents also experienced large population declines. Although there are again exceptions, similar patterns prevail in and around many of the remote rural reservations in the American West. It seems to me that the relatively strong retention or growth of the Native American population on rural reservations is an important success in its own right. It shows that these reservations are not fading away. Indeed, it indicates that many Native Americans value the way of life there, despite continuing economic disadvantages.\nAt the same time, reservations’ success in population retention points to another of the challenges of Indian Country economic development. Over the past century in the United States and around the world, one of the most pervasive responses to rural poverty has been out-migration. Voting with their feet, workers shift from low-paid rural agricultural and resource-based jobs to higher-paid urban work. As workers leave, the rural labor supply contracts. The result is higher wages and incomes for the remaining rural workers, compared with what they would have earned in the absence of rural-urban migration.\nAs a response to rural poverty, out-migration has been lamented by most rural communities, but ultimately accepted as nearly inevitable. For tribes, however, the stakes are higher; accepting out-migration as the cure for reservation poverty would threaten the very existence of the tribe as a viable cultural and political entity. Many reservations in remote rural areas thus face a special challenge. They must raise residents’ incomes without resorting to the levels of out-migration that have helped raise personal incomes in many other rural counties.\nLooking once again at Sioux County on the Standing Rock Reservation, we find 3.8 residents per square mile in 2010. This compares to 2.4 or even fewer residents per square mile in the neighboring nonreservation counties of North Dakota. Standing Rock’s tribal leaders probably see this relatively high population density as a measure of success. And I suspect that, compared with nearby county commissioners, they are even more determined to raise residents’ incomes in place rather than accept population decline as a response to poverty.\nI think that this difference applies to most reservations. And it is one of the distinctive challenges we confront as we seek to promote Indian Country economic development. Several broad topics identified in this conference’s white paper are directly germane to boosting reservation household incomes without shrinking the reservation workforce and tribal population. These topics include education, workforce development, and physical infrastructure.\nA failure pointing to another distinctive feature: Preserving land base\nA strong population base alone may help preserve distinctive Native American cultures. But preserving tribal political sovereignty requires a land base. Tribal sovereigns, like sovereigns in general, rule only over the real estate that is officially under their jurisdiction.\nThe political sovereignty that is based on tribal land sometimes creates development opportunities. The tribal gaming industry is probably the most familiar example. However, special institutions are needed to preserve the reservation land base. And these institutions are a second factor that differentiates Indian Country and rural economic development.\nHistory suggests that reservations do require special arrangements to preserve their land base. The 1887-1934 Allotment Period can be viewed as an experiment in what can happen with weak restrictions on the transfer of tribal land to outside entities. The results were stark, and damaging to tribal sovereignty. Between 1887 and 1934, the land area clearly under tribal jurisdiction fell by 65 percent. In addition, the land within official reservation boundaries often became a hard-to-administer checkerboard. Tribally controlled parcels were frequently scattered among those not under tribal control.\nTo reestablish tribal sovereignty and stem further loss, the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 made it more difficult to remove tribal lands from the trust system administered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. These changes were largely successful in preventing further loss of tribal land. However, many of the participants in last year’s conferences raised concerns about the trust system. They pointed out that it also makes it hard to conduct some basic business transactions, such as using trust land to collateralize business loans or home mortgages.\nThis gives rise to one of the special challenges of Indian Country economic development. That challenge? To develop creative methods to safeguard the tribal land base while simultaneously facilitating the efficient economic use of reservation land. Is an incrementally improved version of today’s trust land system the best solution? Or do we need a more radical change? If the latter, what would the new system look like? I don’t have the answers to those questions, but they seem very important, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this matter. We may also want to expand our dialogue to include new participants with relevant expertise in the design of financial contracts.\nFinding harmony between tribal traditions and economic development\nI have discussed population retention and preservation of land-based tribal sovereignty as two special objectives that make Indian Country economic development different from conventional rural economic development. I don’t mean to say that these are the only differences. For example, the difficult historical experience of Native Americans has left a number of obstacles that will still take time and considerable effort to address. Examples include lower personal wealth, and in some instances, ill-fitting tribal constitutions written by outsiders.\nCompared with off-reservation localities, reservations also deal with a distinctive array of federal programs and often more distant relationships to surrounding state governments. In addition, tribal governments are actively establishing additional business laws and legal institutions in order to protect tribal interests and cultural values on reservations.\nThe recent adoption of updated tribal secured transactions laws is a good example of this. My Community Development staff has worked on this effort for many years with tribal leaders across the country. Like the institutions that govern reservation land ownership, tribal business laws need to be artfully crafted to achieve their intended cultural or political objectives. And the challenge, in part, is to do so while imposing the least possible burden on access to capital, economic efficiency, and overall economic development.\nIn fact, that’s how I see our two-part task today. We must seek policies, laws, and institutions that enable tribes to pursue the cultural and political objectives they truly value. And we must design them so that they won’t unduly impede necessary development. Success in this effort is extremely important. I believe it will contribute significantly to closing the large and regrettable economic gaps that prevail in Indian Country today.\nThat’s an ambitious goal for just one day, but I can sense that the people in this room have a lot of motivation, and plenty of energy: So, let’s get to it.\nEndnote\n1 I thank Dorothy Bridges, Doug Clement, Sandy Gerber, Michael Grover, Jacqueline King, Dick Todd, and Susan Woodrow for their contributions to these remarks.\n\nNote1\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Washington, D.C., and the home of the Federal Reserve System’s Board of Governors. Actually, I am a guest here myself. My own home base is the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, one of 12 independently managed Federal Reserve Banks whose districts span the country. I’m delighted to see so many people joining in this conversation today. I think I speak for all of us here when I thank the staff at the Board of Governors for graciously hosting this event. I should note that the following views are my own, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve.\n\nI just mentioned the Federal Reserve System’s regional structure. This structure, in place for nearly 100 years now, was established by Congress for a very deliberate reason. Congress wanted to ensure that the nation’s central bank keeps in touch with economic issues at the grass-roots level across the United States. The Fed benefits greatly from this regional structure and the community access it allows.\n\nIn our critical monetary policy responsibilities, it helps us understand how economic policies affect Main Street as well as Wall Street. In our financial supervision and regulation responsibilities, it gives us a window into the operations and impact of the entire financial system, from global giants to local banks. In our role as a provider of payments services to the public and the U.S. Treasury, it allows us to perceive and respond quickly to changes in technology and demand. Finally, the Federal Reserve’s decentralized structure also helps us monitor and respond to regional economic issues affecting low- and moderate-income communities, including Native American reservations, through our Community Development departments.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System made good use of this regional structure last year, when it co-sponsored six Growing Economies in Indian Country workshops across the country. Community Development staff at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the Reserve Banks of Minneapolis, Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco helped organize these well-attended and thought-provoking events. Our invaluable partners in this effort included nine federal agencies and numerous national, local, and tribal organizations and individuals.\n\nToday we gather to discuss and respond to the concerns and recommendations that were voiced at those workshops. We’re honored to have a number of distinguished presenters who will address issues raised separately or commonly at the six forums. Before we hear from them, however, I hope you’ll allow me a few minutes to offer some thoughts on economic development in Indian Country.\n\nMy ideas have clearly been influenced by the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank’s work in this area. For the past 20 years, our Community Development department has worked from the ground up with tribal and private sector leaders in Indian Country to strengthen the institutional foundation for economic growth on reservations. Most notably, they have helped develop and implement secured transactions laws and related initiatives. The aim of these efforts: to facilitate the flow of credit and entrepreneurial opportunities on reservations.\n\nToday we will be hearing many additional ideas for institutional and policy reforms that may enhance economic development in Indian Country. I will try to frame our discussion by asking what I hope is a clarifying question: How does Indian Country economic development differ from rural economic development more generally? I realize that a number of reservations and homelands are in or near urban areas. Nonetheless, I think that the rural location of many of the larger and poorer reservations justifies a comparison between Indian Country and rural development. And I should say that by “Indian Country,” I mean the self-governing Native American and Alaska Native communities and reservations throughout the United States, as recognized in federal law.\n\nMy thinking will be guided by a crucial assumption. In particular, I assume that Indian Country residents and leaders place a high value on preserving their native cultures and their tribal sovereignty. This statement may seem obvious to most of you, but I will argue that it clarifies what is special—and perhaps unique—about Indian Country economic development.\n\nThe goal of preserving tribal cultures and sovereignty creates two key differences between rural economic development in general and Indian Country economic development in particular. One difference involves the often painful and disruptive process of population loss through out-migration. Despite such costs, large-scale out-migration from poor rural regions has been a major force for poverty reduction around the globe. But in Indian Country, it is an especially unattractive option, because population loss would threaten the viability of the tribe as a distinct cultural entity. Heightened resistance to out-migration is therefore a special characteristic of economic development in Indian Country.\n\nThe second important difference arises from the distinctive legal arrangements required to maintain meaningful tribal political sovereignty. The most prominent example is a topic we will hear more about today—special restrictions on the ownership of land that are necessary to preserve the reservation land base. Although critical for maintaining tribal sovereignty, Indian Country’s special restrictions on land ownership raise economic development issues that are rarely encountered in other rural economies. In Indian Country, therefore, conventional thinking about rural development needs to be adjusted for two special factors—population retention and restrictions on land ownership. Many of the issues we are discussing today deal, directly or indirectly, with how to make the required adjustments to our thinking.\n\nI hasten to add that I offer my views with a great deal of humility and an open mind. Unlike almost everyone else in the room, I am not an expert on Indian Country. Nor am I here to tell you what needs to be done. I speak as an economist and as a Federal Reserve Bank president with concerns for his district. I hope you will find my comments useful in organizing your own thinking today and perhaps in the future. By the same token, I look forward to hearing your views and refining my own thinking through our dialogue. Please note that, to simplify my discussion, I will hereafter focus my remarks on Native Americans and their reservations. These are the peoples and geographies I am most familiar with in the Minneapolis Federal Reserve district. I ask the audience to make appropriate adaptations of my language to apply, where relevant, to other Indian Country geographies and peoples as well.\n\nToday, as you know, Native Americans on reservations continue to face economic disadvantages relative to other Americans. For example, the American Community Survey assesses the employment status of working-age individuals, defined as 16 years and older. From 2006 through 2010, just over 45 percent of working-age Native Americans on reservations were employed, compared with almost 60 percent of all working-age Americans. Partly as a result, the median annual income among Native American households on a typical reservation was under $35,000 during that period. This compared with $52,000 for all American households and about $37,000 for all Native American households, on and off reservations. As a further consequence, about 25 percent of the Native Americans on reservations lived in households with incomes below the official poverty level during this period, compared with 14 percent of Americans overall.\n\nThese gaps are even larger on more remote reservations, including several in my district. Consider, for example, North Dakota’s portion of the Standing Rock Reservation, which exactly coincides with Sioux County, North Dakota. For 2006 through 2010, about 84 percent of Sioux County’s residents were Native American. On average, over this period, just 37 percent of the working-age Native Americans in Sioux County were employed. This contributed to a median household income of only $31,000 and a 47 percent poverty rate for Native Americans in Sioux County during these years. Again, this is compared with $52,000 for all American households and a 14 percent poverty rate for all Americans.\n\nOf course, it may not be fair to compare a very rural location, like Sioux County, with national averages heavily weighted toward major metropolitan areas. However, Sioux County still lags significantly when compared with rural nonreservation counties, even its immediate neighbor, Grant County, North Dakota. Grant County is equally rural and remote, but its population is 97 percent white. Almost 62 percent of its working-age population was employed during the 2006-2010 period. Higher employment helped households there earn a median income of almost $37,000, more than 25 percent higher than the Native American households in Sioux County. Only about 13 percent of Grant County residents lived in poverty during 2006-2010.\n\nBy these very basic economic measures, therefore, Sioux County’s Native Americans lagged well behind other Americans not only nationally, but also just next door in Grant County. To be sure, not all reservations fit this pattern, especially those with small populations and gaming operations located near major metropolitan areas. Nonetheless, the economic gaps between Sioux County and Grant County, North Dakota, are not uncommon among the large reservations in remote rural areas. Our conversations today will largely focus on how to close those gaps.\n\nThe economic gaps I’ve just cited may not tell the whole story about Sioux and Grant counties and the many other rural reservation and nonreservation areas like them. As I mentioned, population retention is of fundamental importance to Native American tribes. By that measure, Sioux County has been significantly more successful than Grant County.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2010, Sioux County’s population grew by over 2 percent, while Grant County’s population dropped by almost 16 percent. Other nearby counties with mostly white rural residents also experienced large population declines. Although there are again exceptions, similar patterns prevail in and around many of the remote rural reservations in the American West. It seems to me that the relatively strong retention or growth of the Native American population on rural reservations is an important success in its own right. It shows that these reservations are not fading away. Indeed, it indicates that many Native Americans value the way of life there, despite continuing economic disadvantages.\n\nAt the same time, reservations’ success in population retention points to another of the challenges of Indian Country economic development. Over the past century in the United States and around the world, one of the most pervasive responses to rural poverty has been out-migration. Voting with their feet, workers shift from low-paid rural agricultural and resource-based jobs to higher-paid urban work. As workers leave, the rural labor supply contracts. The result is higher wages and incomes for the remaining rural workers, compared with what they would have earned in the absence of rural-urban migration.\n\nAs a response to rural poverty, out-migration has been lamented by most rural communities, but ultimately accepted as nearly inevitable. For tribes, however, the stakes are higher; accepting out-migration as the cure for reservation poverty would threaten the very existence of the tribe as a viable cultural and political entity. Many reservations in remote rural areas thus face a special challenge. They must raise residents’ incomes without resorting to the levels of out-migration that have helped raise personal incomes in many other rural counties.\n\nLooking once again at Sioux County on the Standing Rock Reservation, we find 3.8 residents per square mile in 2010. This compares to 2.4 or even fewer residents per square mile in the neighboring nonreservation counties of North Dakota. Standing Rock’s tribal leaders probably see this relatively high population density as a measure of success. And I suspect that, compared with nearby county commissioners, they are even more determined to raise residents’ incomes in place rather than accept population decline as a response to poverty.\n\nI think that this difference applies to most reservations. And it is one of the distinctive challenges we confront as we seek to promote Indian Country economic development. Several broad topics identified in this conference’s white paper are directly germane to boosting reservation household incomes without shrinking the reservation workforce and tribal population. These topics include education, workforce development, and physical infrastructure.\n\nA strong population base alone may help preserve distinctive Native American cultures. But preserving tribal political sovereignty requires a land base. Tribal sovereigns, like sovereigns in general, rule only over the real estate that is officially under their jurisdiction.\n\nThe political sovereignty that is based on tribal land sometimes creates development opportunities. The tribal gaming industry is probably the most familiar example. However, special institutions are needed to preserve the reservation land base. And these institutions are a second factor that differentiates Indian Country and rural economic development.\n\nHistory suggests that reservations do require special arrangements to preserve their land base. The 1887-1934 Allotment Period can be viewed as an experiment in what can happen with weak restrictions on the transfer of tribal land to outside entities. The results were stark, and damaging to tribal sovereignty. Between 1887 and 1934, the land area clearly under tribal jurisdiction fell by 65 percent. In addition, the land within official reservation boundaries often became a hard-to-administer checkerboard. Tribally controlled parcels were frequently scattered among those not under tribal control.\n\nTo reestablish tribal sovereignty and stem further loss, the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 made it more difficult to remove tribal lands from the trust system administered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. These changes were largely successful in preventing further loss of tribal land. However, many of the participants in last year’s conferences raised concerns about the trust system. They pointed out that it also makes it hard to conduct some basic business transactions, such as using trust land to collateralize business loans or home mortgages.\n\nThis gives rise to one of the special challenges of Indian Country economic development. That challenge? To develop creative methods to safeguard the tribal land base while simultaneously facilitating the efficient economic use of reservation land. Is an incrementally improved version of today’s trust land system the best solution? Or do we need a more radical change? If the latter, what would the new system look like? I don’t have the answers to those questions, but they seem very important, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this matter. We may also want to expand our dialogue to include new participants with relevant expertise in the design of financial contracts.\n\nI have discussed population retention and preservation of land-based tribal sovereignty as two special objectives that make Indian Country economic development different from conventional rural economic development. I don’t mean to say that these are the only differences. For example, the difficult historical experience of Native Americans has left a number of obstacles that will still take time and considerable effort to address. Examples include lower personal wealth, and in some instances, ill-fitting tribal constitutions written by outsiders.\n\nCompared with off-reservation localities, reservations also deal with a distinctive array of federal programs and often more distant relationships to surrounding state governments. In addition, tribal governments are actively establishing additional business laws and legal institutions in order to protect tribal interests and cultural values on reservations.\n\nThe recent adoption of updated tribal secured transactions laws is a good example of this. My Community Development staff has worked on this effort for many years with tribal leaders across the country. Like the institutions that govern reservation land ownership, tribal business laws need to be artfully crafted to achieve their intended cultural or political objectives. And the challenge, in part, is to do so while imposing the least possible burden on access to capital, economic efficiency, and overall economic development.\n\nIn fact, that’s how I see our two-part task today. We must seek policies, laws, and institutions that enable tribes to pursue the cultural and political objectives they truly value. And we must design them so that they won’t unduly impede necessary development. Success in this effort is extremely important. I believe it will contribute significantly to closing the large and regrettable economic gaps that prevail in Indian Country today.\n\nThat’s an ambitious goal for just one day, but I can sense that the people in this room have a lot of motivation, and plenty of energy: So, let’s get to it."

            "content": "Thank you for that generous introduction, and thanks especially for your invitation to speak to the White Bear Lake Chamber of Commerce. I became president of the Minneapolis Fed in October 2009, after many years as an economics professor. I anticipated a fair amount of what this job would entail, but one of the unexpected pleasures has been the opportunity to meet with people from across the Ninth District. I’ve been everywhere from western Montana to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and many places in between, but sometimes it’s nice to stay close to home, and so I appreciate the opportunity to be with all of you here today.\nToday, I want to talk to you about some basics about the FOMC, my outlook for the economy, and the implications of my outlook for monetary policy. I look forward to taking your questions after I’m done. Before I proceed, though, I want to stress that the views you are about to hear are my own, and not those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nSome FOMC Basics\nLet me begin with some basics about the Federal Reserve System. I like to tell people that the Fed is a uniquely American institution. What do I mean by that? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts and includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to set the course of monetary policy. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. (Actually, right now, there are only five governors—two positions are unfilled.) However, the Committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and a rotating group of four other presidents (currently Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco). I’ll be on the committee in 2014. In this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government, because representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations.\nI see this federalist structure as being important because it fosters valuable two-way communication between Americans and their central bank—exactly the kind of two-way communication that we’re engaging in today. Of course, one direction of communication is from regional Fed presidents to the residents of their districts, but the other direction matters a lot too. The input from the presidents to the FOMC relies critically on information they receive from their districts about local economic performance. We obtain this information through the work of our research staffs—but we also obtain it through the kinds of conversations that I had with local business and community leaders before my speech. And, after I’m done talking, your questions and comments will be another important input into my thinking about policy. In my view, this two-way communication between the residents of Main Street and the Federal Reserve System, mediated by the presidents of the regional Feds, is a critical ingredient to the System’s ongoing effectiveness.\nOutlook\nLet me turn now to my outlook for the national economy. I will focus on the three variables that are of particular interest to the FOMC: output, inflation, and unemployment. My discussion will proceed in three parts. First, I will describe the behavior of the economy over the past four years. Next, I will describe my model—really, my story—for those events. Finally, I will use that model or story to form an outlook for the next two years.\nI begin, then, with a look back. The national economy slowed dramatically during 2008 and the first half of 2009. National output—as measured by gross domestic product adjusted for inflation (real GDP)—fell by 5.1 percent from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the second quarter of 2009. The unemployment rate, which was 5 percent in December 2007, reached 10 percent in the second half of 2009 (October).\nSince the middle of 2009, the national economy has recovered at a moderate rate. After four years, national output has finally returned to its prerecession level. Note, though, that returning to 2007 output levels is a relatively low bar: Output remains about 10 percent below where it would be if it had grown in line with historical averages.\nGiven the sluggish recovery in national output, it is not surprising that labor markets are also healing slowly. Employment fell by 8.7 million jobs and has recovered only 3.6 million of those jobs. On an encouraging note, the national unemployment rate has recently fallen to 8.2 percent. But the fraction of people over the age of 16 who have a job, known as the employment-population ratio, is still nearly 7 percent lower than in December 2007.\nFinally, I should note that while output and employment remain quite low, inflation has remained remarkably close to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target. From the fourth quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2011, the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index has grown at an average annual rate of 1.8 percent. Here, I should emphasize that the PCE price index is an index that includes all goods and services, including food and energy. So, I’m not talking about so-called core inflation—I’m talking about what’s called headline inflation.\nThat’s a brief review of the past four years. Real output has recovered back to 2007 levels, but remains well below what one would expect it to be in light of historical growth patterns in the United States. Employment remains well below 2007 levels. Unemployment remains well above 2007 levels. Inflation has averaged close to the Fed’s target.\nNow, I turn to the question of how one might use these data to fashion a forecast for the next year or two. Any forecast of the future is based on an economic model—again, a story—of how the past data came to be. My story for the past four years centers on two key changes in the economy. The first is that from 2006 to 2012, households have lost trillions of dollars in wealth and net worth, as housing and other assets have fallen in value. The second is that households and firms now feel that they must stay prepared for the kind of financial market shock they experienced in 2008. I see these changes in economic conditions as improving over time, but only slowly.\nMany observers—including me—have emphasized how these two changes in the economy have given rise to a fall in households’ demand for consumption goods and in firms’ demand for investment goods. Fortunately, the Fed’s highly accommodative monetary policy has served to mitigate this fall in demand. The Fed’s policy has pushed downward on short-term and long-term interest rates. The lower interest rates encourage consumers to spend and firms to invest.\nWhat’s less often emphasized—but I think is also critical—is that the productive capacity of our country has grown much more slowly than we would have expected prior to the recession. This statement may seem strange at first blush—after all, our workers have not been harmed or injured in some fashion, and our factories have not been damaged or destroyed. But the productive capacity of a country doesn’t depend on just the number of workers and machines available. We live in a dynamic economy, in which enormous numbers of firms, plants, and jobs are continually created and destroyed. The productive capacity of our country depends on how well that dynamic process of creation and destruction—the ongoing reallocation of people and machines across economic tasks—is working. Productive capacity has grown more slowly than usual because this process of reallocation has been materially affected by the fall in household net worth and the rise in firm-level uncertainty.\nThis kind of damage to productive capacity takes many forms, but let me give two concrete examples of what I have in mind. New firms are a major source of employment growth in the economy. But households generally need some kind of capital of their own to initiate a startup—and so the fall in household net worth and wealth makes starting new firms more challenging. Indeed, the number of new firms has fallen sharply since 2006—and so it is not surprising that employment is lower. At the same time, existing firms’ fear of a 2008 financial market shock keeps them from hiring workers whom they might have to fire if 2008 recurred. Both of these forces—fewer startups and firms’ fear of firing—reduce the productive capacity of our economy by making it harder for destroyed jobs to be replaced by created jobs.\nThus, my view is that the economy has experienced both a reduction in the demand for goods and damage to its productive capacity. However, as I think about the outlook for the economy and the appropriate policy reaction to that outlook, I would also like to know which of these two changes is more responsible for the low levels of output and employment. To answer this question, I believe it is useful to look at the behavior of inflation. If the demand for goods remained below the productive capacity of the economy for multiple years, then we should see significant downward pressures on prices. Inflation should be well below the Fed’s target of 2 percent, and possibly falling. But, as I indicated earlier, this has not been the case. Hence, it does not appear that demand is significantly below the productive capacity of the United States.\nTo be clear, this observation does not mean that the Fed’s highly accommodative policy was unwarranted. Without that policy, I’m sure that output, employment, and prices would all be lower. After all, during the early years of the Great Depression, prices were falling at 10 percent per year. Rather, my point is that the Fed’s highly accommodative policy has kept the demand for goods relatively close to the diminished productive capacity of the economy, and so has kept inflation near 2 percent.\nSo, my model of the past four years is that there was a fall in demand and damage to the productive capacity of the country. Fortunately, highly accommodative monetary policy was able to keep the demand for goods close to the productive capacity of the economy, and thereby keep inflation close to the Fed’s target. What does this model imply for my outlook for the evolution of output, employment, and prices over the next four years?\nMy view is that it will take at least several more years for the damage to productive capacity that I’ve described to heal. Thus, I predict that output will grow only moderately, at around 2.5 percent to 3 percent in each of the next two years. This moderate growth will imply that output will remain well below what we might have expected it to be back in 2007. In a similar vein, I expect the rate of employment growth in each of the next two years to be only slightly higher than the rate of population growth. In terms of unemployment, I expect that the unemployment rate will continue to fall slowly, to around 7.7 percent at the end of this year and to around 7 percent by the end of 2013.\nFinally, let me turn to inflation. It is true that low household net worth and wealth will continue to represent significant headwinds for demand. Hence, I would view a highly accommodative monetary policy as being appropriate. As I will explain shortly, though, I expect that the FOMC’s policy will be even more accommodative than I would see as appropriate. Hence, I expect that the core and headline PCE inflation rates will be around 2 percent this year and rise to 2.3 percent in 2013.\nTo sum up: I expect output to grow at 2.5 percent to 3 percent per year in each of the next two years, unemployment to fall to around 7 percent by the end of 2013, and inflation to average over 2 percent over the next two years. How much confidence should you have in this outlook? I can give two conflicting answers to this question. First, any forecast should be viewed as only a benchmark look into the future. Policymakers and the public should both be prepared for other eventualities. Second, I don’t think that my admittedly scant forecasting record is all that bad. In February 2010, I provided my first public outlook for the evolution of real GDP, inflation, and unemployment over the next two years. My forecast for real GDP at the end of 2011 has turned out to be about 1.5 percent too high, and my forecast for unemployment at the end of 2011 was about 30 basis points too high. My forecast for headline PCE inflation has proven to be almost exactly right.\nThree Questions about Policy\nI’ve described my outlook for the next two years. Now I want to use that outlook to answer three questions that I’m often asked about monetary policy. But first, by way of background, let me remind you of the FOMC’s current monetary policy stance.\nRight now, the FOMC has two types of accommodation in place. First, it is targeting a short-term interest rate, the federal funds rate, of between 0 and 0.25 percent, and it expects to keep that interest rate extraordinarily low at least through late 2014. These low interest rates are intended to stimulate consumption by households and investment by firms.\nSecond, the FOMC has bought a large amount of long-term government-issued and government-backed assets. These asset holdings are designed to stimulate longer-term investment. More specifically, any holder of a long-term bond is exposed to interest rate risk, because the value of that bond fluctuates as interest rates vary. When the Fed buys long-term bonds from the private sector, the private sector as a whole is exposed to less interest rate risk. As a result, some private investors will demand a lower premium for holding other bonds that are exposed to interest rate risk. Consequently, all long-term yields fall—and corporations should correspondingly lower their hurdle rates for long-term investment projects.\nThe FOMC does have additional tools. It could exert further downward pressure on long-term market interest rates by buying more long-term Treasury securities or securities issued by government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Alternatively, the Committee could extend its prediction for how long it will keep its target short-term interest rate exceptionally low. So, tools—and choices—remain. The three questions that I will discuss are about those choices.\nQuestion 1: Should the FOMC increase its current level of accommodation?\nCongress has mandated that the FOMC make monetary policy so as to promote price stability and maximum employment. In order to achieve these goals on an ongoing basis, it is essential that FOMC choices evolve in a systematic fashion with the state of the economy. Suppose, for example, that unemployment, and the outlook for unemployment, fall back toward long-run norms. The FOMC is doing better on its employment mandate. Such a change implies that the FOMC does not need to increase its level of monetary accommodation, and may in fact need to reduce the level of accommodation. Suppose that inflation, and the outlook for inflation, rises. Again, such a change implies that the FOMC does not need to raise the level of monetary accommodation, and may in fact need to reduce the level of accommodation.\nWith these basic guidelines in mind, let’s go back to the beginning of last year—that is, January 2011. The unemployment rate was 9.1 percent. The FOMC expected the unemployment rate to fall only slightly by the end of the upcoming year and to remain at 7.9 percent by the end of the following year. The FOMC expected core PCE inflation to be 1.2 percent over the course of the year and to be 1.3 percent over the course of the following year.\nWhat about now? The unemployment rate has fallen to 8.2 percent. As I’ve described, I expect that the unemployment rate will be about 7.7 percent by the end of this year and about 7 percent by the end of the following year. I expect inflation to be around 2 percent in this calendar year and over 2 percent next year.\nThus, the outlook for the unemployment rate has improved, and the outlook for inflation has risen since January 2011. In addition, since the beginning of last year, the FOMC actually added more monetary accommodation. I would say that I see no need for still more accommodation at this time. Indeed, as I mentioned earlier, I believe that the FOMC’s recent accommodative steps will lead to both core and headline inflation being above 2 percent in 2013.\nQuestion 2: Should the FOMC reduce accommodation?\nUsing the same logic as I’ve just described, the answer is yes. From the point of view of the dual mandate, the outlook is better than a year ago—and so we should have less accommodation in place.\nThis does not mean that we should be raising rates anytime soon. Last June, the FOMC issued a consensus statement, describing a sequence of steps that it foresaw using to normalize monetary policy. The exit process is a long one, designed to take place over a number of years, and the Committee would likely not raise rates for some time after the exit process begins. I think that the Committee should only begin this exit process if it can be reasonably sure that it won’t have to reverse itself in the near term. I don’t feel that kind of certainty at this stage, and it follows then that it is not yet time to initiate exit, let alone raise rates.\nHowever, I would say that it would be appropriate to change the Fed’s current forward guidance to the public about the future course of interest rates. Currently, the FOMC statement reads that the Committee believes that conditions will warrant extraordinarily low interest rates through late 2014. My own belief is that we will need to initiate our somewhat lengthy exit strategy sometime in the next six to nine months or so, and that conditions will warrant raising rates sometime in 2013 or, possibly, late 2012.\nQuestion 3: Would you ever be in favor of adding accommodation?\nThe answer to this is simple: yes. If the outlook for inflation fell sufficiently and/or the outlook for unemployment rose sufficiently, then I would recommend adding accommodation. There are a number of ways that this could be done. My own preference would be for the FOMC to purchase additional Treasuries or securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in an attempt to drive down longer-term interest rates.\nMore generally, as I discussed earlier, any forecast should be viewed as only a benchmark look into the future. Hence, I believe that the Committee would be well served by describing a public contingency plan that discusses its likely policy reactions to an array of scenarios that are viewed as possible in the next year or two. This contingency plan would be beneficial to the economy by reducing the public’s uncertainty about the Committee’s ability and willingness to react to various future contingencies. A public contingency plan would also enhance accountability by forcing the Committee to explain how its choices are linked to the evolution of the economy.\nConclusions\nAs is my wont, I’ve covered a lot of ground today. Let me close by emphasizing three points that seem especially important. First, the fall in household net worth/wealth and increase in firm uncertainty since 2007 have had adverse impacts on demand and on productive capacity. Over the past four years, the FOMC’s highly accommodative policy has been successful at keeping demand close to productive capacity, as is evidenced by how close inflation has been to 2 percent. I see no need for additional accommodation at this time, and I believe that conditions will warrant raising rates well before the end of 2014.\nSecond, the FOMC has become more transparent about its benchmark outlook for the economy, and the evolution of policy, given that outlook. But outlooks are always uncertain, and especially so today. As I have described in earlier speeches, I believe that the Committee would be well served to be more public about how it would react to scenarios that differ from its benchmark.\nFinally, this has been a very busy week for Fedspeak, as it is often called! A number of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee have given speeches this week about their views on the economy and the appropriate course of monetary policy. These speeches often vary in perspectives and conclusions. I want to close by discussing how the public should interpret these speeches.\nLet me start by saying what these speeches are not. Every speaker has highlighted that he or she is speaking on behalf of him- or herself, and not on behalf of the FOMC. This disclaimer is important and should be taken seriously. The evolution of monetary policy is a collective decision made by the Committee in its meetings. No individual speaker can tell you what those decisions will be.\nWhat, then, is the point of these speeches? Monetary policy is made by a committee—both here and elsewhere in the world—because policy is better when it is grounded in the sharing of, and the consideration of, a wide range of perspectives. FOMC meeting participants are using their speeches to give the public a sense of that range of perspectives. Especially over the longer term, I see this form of transparency as making clear to all that we are indeed an institution that makes policies through the process of two-way communication that I described earlier. In this way, Fedspeak enhances and builds the public’s trust in our institution.\nThanks for your attention. I look forward to your questions.\n\nThank you for that generous introduction, and thanks especially for your invitation to speak to the White Bear Lake Chamber of Commerce. I became president of the Minneapolis Fed in October 2009, after many years as an economics professor. I anticipated a fair amount of what this job would entail, but one of the unexpected pleasures has been the opportunity to meet with people from across the Ninth District. I’ve been everywhere from western Montana to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and many places in between, but sometimes it’s nice to stay close to home, and so I appreciate the opportunity to be with all of you here today.\n\nToday, I want to talk to you about some basics about the FOMC, my outlook for the economy, and the implications of my outlook for monetary policy. I look forward to taking your questions after I’m done. Before I proceed, though, I want to stress that the views you are about to hear are my own, and not those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nLet me begin with some basics about the Federal Reserve System. I like to tell people that the Fed is a uniquely American institution. What do I mean by that? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts and includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\n\nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to set the course of monetary policy. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. (Actually, right now, there are only five governors—two positions are unfilled.) However, the Committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and a rotating group of four other presidents (currently Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco). I’ll be on the committee in 2014. In this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government, because representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations.\n\nI see this federalist structure as being important because it fosters valuable two-way communication between Americans and their central bank—exactly the kind of two-way communication that we’re engaging in today. Of course, one direction of communication is from regional Fed presidents to the residents of their districts, but the other direction matters a lot too. The input from the presidents to the FOMC relies critically on information they receive from their districts about local economic performance. We obtain this information through the work of our research staffs—but we also obtain it through the kinds of conversations that I had with local business and community leaders before my speech. And, after I’m done talking, your questions and comments will be another important input into my thinking about policy. In my view, this two-way communication between the residents of Main Street and the Federal Reserve System, mediated by the presidents of the regional Feds, is a critical ingredient to the System’s ongoing effectiveness.\n\nLet me turn now to my outlook for the national economy. I will focus on the three variables that are of particular interest to the FOMC: output, inflation, and unemployment. My discussion will proceed in three parts. First, I will describe the behavior of the economy over the past four years. Next, I will describe my model—really, my story—for those events. Finally, I will use that model or story to form an outlook for the next two years.\n\nI begin, then, with a look back. The national economy slowed dramatically during 2008 and the first half of 2009. National output—as measured by gross domestic product adjusted for inflation (real GDP)—fell by 5.1 percent from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the second quarter of 2009. The unemployment rate, which was 5 percent in December 2007, reached 10 percent in the second half of 2009 (October).\n\nSince the middle of 2009, the national economy has recovered at a moderate rate. After four years, national output has finally returned to its prerecession level. Note, though, that returning to 2007 output levels is a relatively low bar: Output remains about 10 percent below where it would be if it had grown in line with historical averages.\n\nGiven the sluggish recovery in national output, it is not surprising that labor markets are also healing slowly. Employment fell by 8.7 million jobs and has recovered only 3.6 million of those jobs. On an encouraging note, the national unemployment rate has recently fallen to 8.2 percent. But the fraction of people over the age of 16 who have a job, known as the employment-population ratio, is still nearly 7 percent lower than in December 2007.\n\nFinally, I should note that while output and employment remain quite low, inflation has remained remarkably close to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target. From the fourth quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2011, the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index has grown at an average annual rate of 1.8 percent. Here, I should emphasize that the PCE price index is an index that includes all goods and services, including food and energy. So, I’m not talking about so-called core inflation—I’m talking about what’s called headline inflation.\n\nThat’s a brief review of the past four years. Real output has recovered back to 2007 levels, but remains well below what one would expect it to be in light of historical growth patterns in the United States. Employment remains well below 2007 levels. Unemployment remains well above 2007 levels. Inflation has averaged close to the Fed’s target.\n\nNow, I turn to the question of how one might use these data to fashion a forecast for the next year or two. Any forecast of the future is based on an economic model—again, a story—of how the past data came to be. My story for the past four years centers on two key changes in the economy. The first is that from 2006 to 2012, households have lost trillions of dollars in wealth and net worth, as housing and other assets have fallen in value. The second is that households and firms now feel that they must stay prepared for the kind of financial market shock they experienced in 2008. I see these changes in economic conditions as improving over time, but only slowly.\n\nMany observers—including me—have emphasized how these two changes in the economy have given rise to a fall in households’ demand for consumption goods and in firms’ demand for investment goods. Fortunately, the Fed’s highly accommodative monetary policy has served to mitigate this fall in demand. The Fed’s policy has pushed downward on short-term and long-term interest rates. The lower interest rates encourage consumers to spend and firms to invest.\n\nWhat’s less often emphasized—but I think is also critical—is that the productive capacity of our country has grown much more slowly than we would have expected prior to the recession. This statement may seem strange at first blush—after all, our workers have not been harmed or injured in some fashion, and our factories have not been damaged or destroyed. But the productive capacity of a country doesn’t depend on just the number of workers and machines available. We live in a dynamic economy, in which enormous numbers of firms, plants, and jobs are continually created and destroyed. The productive capacity of our country depends on how well that dynamic process of creation and destruction—the ongoing reallocation of people and machines across economic tasks—is working. Productive capacity has grown more slowly than usual because this process of reallocation has been materially affected by the fall in household net worth and the rise in firm-level uncertainty.\n\nThis kind of damage to productive capacity takes many forms, but let me give two concrete examples of what I have in mind. New firms are a major source of employment growth in the economy. But households generally need some kind of capital of their own to initiate a startup—and so the fall in household net worth and wealth makes starting new firms more challenging. Indeed, the number of new firms has fallen sharply since 2006—and so it is not surprising that employment is lower. At the same time, existing firms’ fear of a 2008 financial market shock keeps them from hiring workers whom they might have to fire if 2008 recurred. Both of these forces—fewer startups and firms’ fear of firing—reduce the productive capacity of our economy by making it harder for destroyed jobs to be replaced by created jobs.\n\nThus, my view is that the economy has experienced both a reduction in the demand for goods and damage to its productive capacity. However, as I think about the outlook for the economy and the appropriate policy reaction to that outlook, I would also like to know which of these two changes is more responsible for the low levels of output and employment. To answer this question, I believe it is useful to look at the behavior of inflation. If the demand for goods remained below the productive capacity of the economy for multiple years, then we should see significant downward pressures on prices. Inflation should be well below the Fed’s target of 2 percent, and possibly falling. But, as I indicated earlier, this has not been the case. Hence, it does not appear that demand is significantly below the productive capacity of the United States.\n\nTo be clear, this observation does not mean that the Fed’s highly accommodative policy was unwarranted. Without that policy, I’m sure that output, employment, and prices would all be lower. After all, during the early years of the Great Depression, prices were falling at 10 percent per year. Rather, my point is that the Fed’s highly accommodative policy has kept the demand for goods relatively close to the diminished productive capacity of the economy, and so has kept inflation near 2 percent.\n\nSo, my model of the past four years is that there was a fall in demand and damage to the productive capacity of the country. Fortunately, highly accommodative monetary policy was able to keep the demand for goods close to the productive capacity of the economy, and thereby keep inflation close to the Fed’s target. What does this model imply for my outlook for the evolution of output, employment, and prices over the next four years?\n\nMy view is that it will take at least several more years for the damage to productive capacity that I’ve described to heal. Thus, I predict that output will grow only moderately, at around 2.5 percent to 3 percent in each of the next two years. This moderate growth will imply that output will remain well below what we might have expected it to be back in 2007. In a similar vein, I expect the rate of employment growth in each of the next two years to be only slightly higher than the rate of population growth. In terms of unemployment, I expect that the unemployment rate will continue to fall slowly, to around 7.7 percent at the end of this year and to around 7 percent by the end of 2013.\n\nFinally, let me turn to inflation. It is true that low household net worth and wealth will continue to represent significant headwinds for demand. Hence, I would view a highly accommodative monetary policy as being appropriate. As I will explain shortly, though, I expect that the FOMC’s policy will be even more accommodative than I would see as appropriate. Hence, I expect that the core and headline PCE inflation rates will be around 2 percent this year and rise to 2.3 percent in 2013.\n\nTo sum up: I expect output to grow at 2.5 percent to 3 percent per year in each of the next two years, unemployment to fall to around 7 percent by the end of 2013, and inflation to average over 2 percent over the next two years. How much confidence should you have in this outlook? I can give two conflicting answers to this question. First, any forecast should be viewed as only a benchmark look into the future. Policymakers and the public should both be prepared for other eventualities. Second, I don’t think that my admittedly scant forecasting record is all that bad. In February 2010, I provided my first public outlook for the evolution of real GDP, inflation, and unemployment over the next two years. My forecast for real GDP at the end of 2011 has turned out to be about 1.5 percent too high, and my forecast for unemployment at the end of 2011 was about 30 basis points too high. My forecast for headline PCE inflation has proven to be almost exactly right.\n\nI’ve described my outlook for the next two years. Now I want to use that outlook to answer three questions that I’m often asked about monetary policy. But first, by way of background, let me remind you of the FOMC’s current monetary policy stance.\n\nRight now, the FOMC has two types of accommodation in place. First, it is targeting a short-term interest rate, the federal funds rate, of between 0 and 0.25 percent, and it expects to keep that interest rate extraordinarily low at least through late 2014. These low interest rates are intended to stimulate consumption by households and investment by firms.\n\nSecond, the FOMC has bought a large amount of long-term government-issued and government-backed assets. These asset holdings are designed to stimulate longer-term investment. More specifically, any holder of a long-term bond is exposed to interest rate risk, because the value of that bond fluctuates as interest rates vary. When the Fed buys long-term bonds from the private sector, the private sector as a whole is exposed to less interest rate risk. As a result, some private investors will demand a lower premium for holding other bonds that are exposed to interest rate risk. Consequently, all long-term yields fall—and corporations should correspondingly lower their hurdle rates for long-term investment projects.\n\nThe FOMC does have additional tools. It could exert further downward pressure on long-term market interest rates by buying more long-term Treasury securities or securities issued by government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Alternatively, the Committee could extend its prediction for how long it will keep its target short-term interest rate exceptionally low. So, tools—and choices—remain. The three questions that I will discuss are about those choices.\n\nQuestion 1: Should the FOMC increase its current level of accommodation?\nCongress has mandated that the FOMC make monetary policy so as to promote price stability and maximum employment. In order to achieve these goals on an ongoing basis, it is essential that FOMC choices evolve in a systematic fashion with the state of the economy. Suppose, for example, that unemployment, and the outlook for unemployment, fall back toward long-run norms. The FOMC is doing better on its employment mandate. Such a change implies that the FOMC does not need to increase its level of monetary accommodation, and may in fact need to reduce the level of accommodation. Suppose that inflation, and the outlook for inflation, rises. Again, such a change implies that the FOMC does not need to raise the level of monetary accommodation, and may in fact need to reduce the level of accommodation.\n\nWith these basic guidelines in mind, let’s go back to the beginning of last year—that is, January 2011. The unemployment rate was 9.1 percent. The FOMC expected the unemployment rate to fall only slightly by the end of the upcoming year and to remain at 7.9 percent by the end of the following year. The FOMC expected core PCE inflation to be 1.2 percent over the course of the year and to be 1.3 percent over the course of the following year.\n\nWhat about now? The unemployment rate has fallen to 8.2 percent. As I’ve described, I expect that the unemployment rate will be about 7.7 percent by the end of this year and about 7 percent by the end of the following year. I expect inflation to be around 2 percent in this calendar year and over 2 percent next year.\n\nThus, the outlook for the unemployment rate has improved, and the outlook for inflation has risen since January 2011. In addition, since the beginning of last year, the FOMC actually added more monetary accommodation. I would say that I see no need for still more accommodation at this time. Indeed, as I mentioned earlier, I believe that the FOMC’s recent accommodative steps will lead to both core and headline inflation being above 2 percent in 2013.\n\nQuestion 2: Should the FOMC reduce accommodation?\nUsing the same logic as I’ve just described, the answer is yes. From the point of view of the dual mandate, the outlook is better than a year ago—and so we should have less accommodation in place.\n\nThis does not mean that we should be raising rates anytime soon. Last June, the FOMC issued a consensus statement, describing a sequence of steps that it foresaw using to normalize monetary policy. The exit process is a long one, designed to take place over a number of years, and the Committee would likely not raise rates for some time after the exit process begins. I think that the Committee should only begin this exit process if it can be reasonably sure that it won’t have to reverse itself in the near term. I don’t feel that kind of certainty at this stage, and it follows then that it is not yet time to initiate exit, let alone raise rates.\n\nHowever, I would say that it would be appropriate to change the Fed’s current forward guidance to the public about the future course of interest rates. Currently, the FOMC statement reads that the Committee believes that conditions will warrant extraordinarily low interest rates through late 2014. My own belief is that we will need to initiate our somewhat lengthy exit strategy sometime in the next six to nine months or so, and that conditions will warrant raising rates sometime in 2013 or, possibly, late 2012.\n\nQuestion 3: Would you ever be in favor of adding accommodation?\nThe answer to this is simple: yes. If the outlook for inflation fell sufficiently and/or the outlook for unemployment rose sufficiently, then I would recommend adding accommodation. There are a number of ways that this could be done. My own preference would be for the FOMC to purchase additional Treasuries or securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in an attempt to drive down longer-term interest rates.\n\nMore generally, as I discussed earlier, any forecast should be viewed as only a benchmark look into the future. Hence, I believe that the Committee would be well served by describing a public contingency plan that discusses its likely policy reactions to an array of scenarios that are viewed as possible in the next year or two. This contingency plan would be beneficial to the economy by reducing the public’s uncertainty about the Committee’s ability and willingness to react to various future contingencies. A public contingency plan would also enhance accountability by forcing the Committee to explain how its choices are linked to the evolution of the economy.\n\nAs is my wont, I’ve covered a lot of ground today. Let me close by emphasizing three points that seem especially important. First, the fall in household net worth/wealth and increase in firm uncertainty since 2007 have had adverse impacts on demand and on productive capacity. Over the past four years, the FOMC’s highly accommodative policy has been successful at keeping demand close to productive capacity, as is evidenced by how close inflation has been to 2 percent. I see no need for additional accommodation at this time, and I believe that conditions will warrant raising rates well before the end of 2014.\n\nSecond, the FOMC has become more transparent about its benchmark outlook for the economy, and the evolution of policy, given that outlook. But outlooks are always uncertain, and especially so today. As I have described in earlier speeches, I believe that the Committee would be well served to be more public about how it would react to scenarios that differ from its benchmark.\n\nFinally, this has been a very busy week for Fedspeak, as it is often called! A number of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee have given speeches this week about their views on the economy and the appropriate course of monetary policy. These speeches often vary in perspectives and conclusions. I want to close by discussing how the public should interpret these speeches.\n\nLet me start by saying what these speeches are not. Every speaker has highlighted that he or she is speaking on behalf of him- or herself, and not on behalf of the FOMC. This disclaimer is important and should be taken seriously. The evolution of monetary policy is a collective decision made by the Committee in its meetings. No individual speaker can tell you what those decisions will be.\n\nWhat, then, is the point of these speeches? Monetary policy is made by a committee—both here and elsewhere in the world—because policy is better when it is grounded in the sharing of, and the consideration of, a wide range of perspectives. FOMC meeting participants are using their speeches to give the public a sense of that range of perspectives. Especially over the longer term, I see this form of transparency as making clear to all that we are indeed an institution that makes policies through the process of two-way communication that I described earlier. In this way, Fedspeak enhances and builds the public’s trust in our institution.\n\nThanks for your attention. I look forward to your questions."

            "content": "Thank you for that generous introduction, and thanks especially for your invitation to speak to the Southern Minnesota Business Leaders. I became president of the Minneapolis Fed in October 2009, after many years as an economics professor. My new job has brought with it many unexpected and wonderful new experiences. And certainly today is bringing me another—my first speech inside a dairy.\nToday, I want to talk to you about some basics about the FOMC, my outlook for the economy, and the implications of my outlook for monetary policy. I look forward to taking your questions after I’m done. Before I proceed, though, I want to stress that the views you are about to hear are my own, and not those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nSome FOMC Basics\nLet me begin with some basics about the Federal Reserve System. I like to tell people that the Fed is a uniquely American institution. What do I mean by that? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts and includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to set the course of monetary policy. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. (Actually, right now, there are only five governors—two positions are unfilled.) However, the Committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and a rotating group of four other presidents (currently Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco). I’ll be on the committee in 2014. In this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government, because representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations.\nI see this federalist structure as being important because it fosters valuable two-way communication between Americans and their central bank—exactly the kind of two-way communication that we’re engaging in today. Of course, one direction of communication is from regional Fed presidents to the residents of their districts, but the other direction matters a lot too. The input from the presidents to the FOMC relies critically on information they receive from their districts about local economic performance. We obtain this information through the work of our research staffs—but we also obtain it through the kinds of conversations that I had with local business and community leaders before my speech. And, after I’m done talking, your questions and comments will be another important input into my thinking about policy. In my view, this two-way communication between the residents of Main Street and the Federal Reserve System, mediated by the presidents of the regional Feds, is a critical ingredient to the System’s ongoing effectiveness.\nOutlook\nLet me turn now to my outlook for the national economy. I will focus on the three variables that are of particular interest to the FOMC: output, inflation, and unemployment. My discussion will proceed in three parts. First, I will describe the behavior of the economy over the past four years. Next, I will describe my model—really, my story—for those events. Finally, I will use that model or story to form an outlook for the next two years.\nI begin, then, with a look back. The national economy slowed dramatically during 2008 and the first half of 2009. National output—as measured by gross domestic product adjusted for inflation (real GDP)—fell by 5.1 percent from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the second quarter of 2009. The unemployment rate, which was 5 percent in December 2007, reached 10 percent in the second half of 2009 (October).\nSince the middle of 2009, the national economy has recovered at a moderate rate. After four years, national output has finally returned to its prerecession level. Note, though, that returning to 2007 output levels is a relatively low bar: Output remains about 10 percent below where it would be if it had grown in line with historical averages.\nGiven the sluggish recovery in national output, it is not surprising that labor markets are also healing slowly. Employment fell by 8.7 million jobs and has recovered only 3.6 million of those jobs. On an encouraging note, the national unemployment rate has recently fallen to 8.2 percent. But the fraction of people over the age of 16 who have a job, known as the employment-population ratio, is still nearly 7 percent lower than in December 2007.\nFinally, I should note that while output and employment remain quite low, inflation has remained remarkably close to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target. From the fourth quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2011, the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index has grown at an average annual rate of 1.8 percent. Here, I should emphasize that the PCE price index is an index that includes all goods and services, including food and energy. So, I’m not talking about so-called core inflation—I’m talking about what’s called headline inflation.\nThat’s a brief review of the past four years. Real output has recovered back to 2007 levels, but remains well below what one would expect it to be in light of historical growth patterns in the United States. Employment remains well below 2007 levels. Unemployment remains well above 2007 levels. Inflation has averaged close to the Fed’s target.\nNow, I turn to the question of how one might use these data to fashion a forecast for the next year or two. Any forecast of the future is based on an economic model—again, a story—of how the past data came to be. My story for the past four years centers on two key changes in the economy. The first is that from 2006 to 2012, households have lost trillions of dollars in wealth and net worth, as housing and other assets have fallen in value. The second is that households and firms now feel that they must stay prepared for the kind of financial market shock they experienced in 2008. I see these changes in economic conditions as improving over time, but only slowly.\nMany observers—including me—have emphasized how these two changes in the economy have given rise to a fall in households’ demand for consumption goods and in firms’ demand for investment goods. Fortunately, the Fed’s highly accommodative monetary policy has served to mitigate this fall in demand. The Fed’s policy has pushed downward on short-term and long-term interest rates. The lower interest rates encourage consumers to spend and firms to invest.\nWhat’s less often emphasized—but I think is also critical—is that the productive capacity of our country has grown much more slowly than we would have expected prior to the recession. This statement may seem strange at first blush—after all, our workers have not been harmed or injured in some fashion, and our factories have not been damaged or destroyed. But the productive capacity of a country doesn’t depend on just the number of workers and machines available. We live in a dynamic economy, in which enormous numbers of firms, plants, and jobs are continually created and destroyed. The productive capacity of our country depends on how well that dynamic process of creation and destruction—the ongoing reallocation of people and machines across economic tasks—is working. Productive capacity has grown more slowly than usual because this process of reallocation has been materially affected by the fall in household net worth and the rise in firm-level uncertainty.\nThis kind of damage to productive capacity takes many forms, but let me give two concrete examples of what I have in mind. New firms are a major source of employment growth in the economy. But households generally need some kind of capital of their own to initiate a startup—and so the fall in household net worth and wealth makes starting new firms more challenging. Indeed, the number of new firms has fallen sharply since 2006—and so it is not surprising that employment is lower. At the same time, existing firms’ fear of a 2008 financial market shock keeps them from hiring workers whom they might have to fire if 2008 recurred. Both of these forces—fewer startups and firms’ fear of firing—reduce the productive capacity of our economy by making it harder for destroyed jobs to be replaced by created jobs.\nThus, my view is that the economy has experienced both a reduction in the demand for goods and damage to its productive capacity. However, as I think about the outlook for the economy and the appropriate policy reaction to that outlook, I would also like to know which of these two changes is more responsible for the low levels of output and employment. To answer this question, I believe it is useful to look at the behavior of inflation. If the demand for goods remained below the productive capacity of the economy for multiple years, then we should see significant downward pressures on prices. Inflation should be well below the Fed’s target of 2 percent, and possibly falling. But, as I indicated earlier, this has not been the case. Hence, it does not appear that demand is significantly below the productive capacity of the United States.\nTo be clear, this observation does not mean that the Fed’s highly accommodative policy was unwarranted. Without that policy, I’m sure that output, employment, and prices would all be lower. After all, during the early years of the Great Depression, prices were falling at 10 percent per year. Rather, my point is that the Fed’s highly accommodative policy has kept the demand for goods relatively close to the diminished productive capacity of the economy, and so has kept inflation near 2 percent.\nSo, my model of the past four years is that there was a fall in demand and damage to the productive capacity of the country. Fortunately, highly accommodative monetary policy was able to keep the demand for goods close to the productive capacity of the economy, and thereby keep inflation close to the Fed’s target. What does this model imply for my outlook for the evolution of output, employment, and prices over the next four years?\nMy view is that it will take at least several more years for the damage to productive capacity that I’ve described to heal. Thus, I predict that output will grow only moderately, at around 2.5 percent to 3 percent in each of the next two years. This moderate growth will imply that output will remain well below what we might have expected it to be back in 2007. In a similar vein, I expect the rate of employment growth in each of the next two years to be only slightly higher than the rate of population growth. In terms of unemployment, I expect that the unemployment rate will continue to fall slowly, to around 7.7 percent at the end of this year and to around 7 percent by the end of 2013.\nFinally, let me turn to inflation. It is true that low household net worth and wealth will continue to represent significant headwinds for demand. Hence, I would view a highly accommodative monetary policy as being appropriate. As I will explain shortly, though, I expect that the FOMC’s policy will be even more accommodative than I would see as appropriate. Hence, I expect that the core and headline PCE inflation rates will be around 2 percent this year and rise to 2.3 percent in 2013.\nTo sum up: I expect output to grow at 2.5 percent to 3 percent per year in each of the next two years, unemployment to fall to around 7 percent by the end of 2013, and inflation to average over 2 percent over the next two years. How much confidence should you have in this outlook? I can give two conflicting answers to this question. First, any forecast should be viewed as only a benchmark look into the future. Policymakers and the public should both be prepared for other eventualities. Second, I don’t think that my admittedly scant forecasting record is all that bad. In February 2010, I provided my first public outlook for the evolution of real GDP, inflation, and unemployment over the next two years. My forecast for real GDP at the end of 2011 has turned out to be about 1.5 percent too high, and my forecast for unemployment at the end of 2011 was about 30 basis points too high. My forecast for headline PCE inflation has proven to be almost exactly right.\nThree Questions about Policy\nI’ve described my outlook for the next two years. Now I want to use that outlook to answer three questions that I’m often asked about monetary policy. But first, by way of background, let me remind you of the FOMC’s current monetary policy stance.\nRight now, the FOMC has two types of accommodation in place. First, it is targeting a short-term interest rate, the federal funds rate, of between 0 and 0.25 percent, and it expects to keep that interest rate extraordinarily low at least through late 2014. These low interest rates are intended to stimulate consumption by households and investment by firms.\nSecond, the FOMC has bought a large amount of long-term government-issued and government-backed assets. These asset holdings are designed to stimulate longer-term investment. More specifically, any holder of a long-term bond is exposed to interest rate risk, because the value of that bond fluctuates as interest rates vary. When the Fed buys long-term bonds from the private sector, the private sector as a whole is exposed to less interest rate risk. As a result, some private investors will demand a lower premium for holding other bonds that are exposed to interest rate risk. Consequently, all long-term yields fall—and corporations should correspondingly lower their hurdle rates for long-term investment projects.\nThe FOMC does have additional tools. It could exert further downward pressure on long-term market interest rates by buying more long-term Treasury securities or securities issued by government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Alternatively, the Committee could extend its prediction for how long it will keep its target short-term interest rate exceptionally low. So, tools—and choices—remain. The three questions that I will discuss are about those choices.\nQuestion 1: Should the FOMC increase its current level of accommodation?\nCongress has mandated that the FOMC make monetary policy so as to promote price stability and maximum employment. In order to achieve these goals on an ongoing basis, it is essential that FOMC choices evolve in a systematic fashion with the state of the economy. Suppose, for example, that unemployment, and the outlook for unemployment, fall back toward long-run norms. The FOMC is doing better on its employment mandate. Such a change implies that the FOMC does not need to increase its level of monetary accommodation, and may in fact need to reduce the level of accommodation. Suppose that inflation, and the outlook for inflation, rises. Again, such a change implies that the FOMC does not need to raise the level of monetary accommodation, and may in fact need to reduce the level of accommodation.\nWith these basic guidelines in mind, let’s go back to the beginning of last year—that is, January 2011. The unemployment rate was 9.1 percent. The FOMC expected the unemployment rate to fall only slightly by the end of the upcoming year and to remain at 7.9 percent by the end of the following year. The FOMC expected core PCE inflation to be 1.2 percent over the course of the year and to be 1.3 percent over the course of the following year.\nWhat about now? The unemployment rate has fallen to 8.2 percent. As I’ve described, I expect that the unemployment rate will be about 7.7 percent by the end of this year and about 7 percent by the end of the following year. I expect inflation to be around 2 percent in this calendar year and over 2 percent next year.\nThus, the outlook for the unemployment rate has improved, and the outlook for inflation has risen since January 2011. In addition, since the beginning of last year, the FOMC actually added more monetary accommodation. I would say that I see no need for still more accommodation at this time. Indeed, as I mentioned earlier, I believe that the FOMC’s recent accommodative steps will lead to both core and headline inflation being above 2 percent in 2013.\nQuestion 2: Should the FOMC reduce accommodation?\nUsing the same logic as I’ve just described, the answer is yes. From the point of view of the dual mandate, the outlook is better than a year ago—and so we should have less accommodation in place.\nThis does not mean that we should be raising rates anytime soon. Last June, the FOMC issued a consensus statement, describing a sequence of steps that it foresaw using to normalize monetary policy. The exit process is a long one, designed to take place over a number of years, and the Committee would likely not raise rates for some time after the exit process begins. I think that the Committee should only begin this exit process if it can be reasonably sure that it won’t have to reverse itself in the near term. I don’t feel that kind of certainty at this stage, and it follows then that it is not yet time to initiate exit, let alone raise rates.\nHowever, I would say that it would be appropriate to change the Fed’s current forward guidance to the public about the future course of interest rates. Currently, the FOMC statement reads that the Committee believes that conditions will warrant extraordinarily low interest rates through late 2014. My own belief is that we will need to initiate our somewhat lengthy exit strategy sometime in the next six to nine months or so, and that conditions will warrant raising rates sometime in 2013 or, possibly, late 2012.\nQuestion 3: Would you ever be in favor of adding accommodation?\nThe answer to this is simple: yes. If the outlook for inflation fell sufficiently and/or the outlook for unemployment rose sufficiently, then I would recommend adding accommodation. There are a number of ways that this could be done. My own preference would be for the FOMC to purchase additional Treasuries or securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in an attempt to drive down longer-term interest rates.\nMore generally, as I discussed earlier, any forecast should be viewed as only a benchmark look into the future. Hence, I believe that the Committee would be well served by describing a public contingency plan that discusses its likely policy reactions to an array of scenarios that are viewed as possible in the next year or two. This contingency plan would be beneficial to the economy by reducing the public’s uncertainty about the Committee’s ability and willingness to react to various future contingencies. A public contingency plan would also enhance accountability by forcing the Committee to explain how its choices are linked to the evolution of the economy.\nConclusions\nAs is my wont, I’ve covered a lot of ground today. Let me close by emphasizing two points that seem especially important. First, the fall in household net worth/wealth and increase in firm uncertainty since 2007 have had adverse impacts on demand and on productive capacity. Over the past four years, the FOMC’s highly accommodative policy has been successful at keeping demand close to productive capacity, as is evidenced by how close inflation has been to 2 percent. I see no need for additional accommodation at this time, and I believe that conditions will warrant raising rates well before the end of 2014.\nSecond, the FOMC has become more transparent about its benchmark outlook for the economy, and the evolution of policy, given that outlook. But outlooks are always uncertain, and especially so today. As I have described in earlier speeches, I believe that the Committee would be well served to be more public about how it would react to scenarios that differ from its benchmark.\nThanks for your attention. I look forward to your questions.\n\nThank you for that generous introduction, and thanks especially for your invitation to speak to the Southern Minnesota Business Leaders. I became president of the Minneapolis Fed in October 2009, after many years as an economics professor. My new job has brought with it many unexpected and wonderful new experiences. And certainly today is bringing me another—my first speech inside a dairy.\n\nToday, I want to talk to you about some basics about the FOMC, my outlook for the economy, and the implications of my outlook for monetary policy. I look forward to taking your questions after I’m done. Before I proceed, though, I want to stress that the views you are about to hear are my own, and not those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nLet me begin with some basics about the Federal Reserve System. I like to tell people that the Fed is a uniquely American institution. What do I mean by that? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts and includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\n\nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to set the course of monetary policy. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. (Actually, right now, there are only five governors—two positions are unfilled.) However, the Committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and a rotating group of four other presidents (currently Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco). I’ll be on the committee in 2014. In this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government, because representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations.\n\nI see this federalist structure as being important because it fosters valuable two-way communication between Americans and their central bank—exactly the kind of two-way communication that we’re engaging in today. Of course, one direction of communication is from regional Fed presidents to the residents of their districts, but the other direction matters a lot too. The input from the presidents to the FOMC relies critically on information they receive from their districts about local economic performance. We obtain this information through the work of our research staffs—but we also obtain it through the kinds of conversations that I had with local business and community leaders before my speech. And, after I’m done talking, your questions and comments will be another important input into my thinking about policy. In my view, this two-way communication between the residents of Main Street and the Federal Reserve System, mediated by the presidents of the regional Feds, is a critical ingredient to the System’s ongoing effectiveness.\n\nLet me turn now to my outlook for the national economy. I will focus on the three variables that are of particular interest to the FOMC: output, inflation, and unemployment. My discussion will proceed in three parts. First, I will describe the behavior of the economy over the past four years. Next, I will describe my model—really, my story—for those events. Finally, I will use that model or story to form an outlook for the next two years.\n\nI begin, then, with a look back. The national economy slowed dramatically during 2008 and the first half of 2009. National output—as measured by gross domestic product adjusted for inflation (real GDP)—fell by 5.1 percent from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the second quarter of 2009. The unemployment rate, which was 5 percent in December 2007, reached 10 percent in the second half of 2009 (October).\n\nSince the middle of 2009, the national economy has recovered at a moderate rate. After four years, national output has finally returned to its prerecession level. Note, though, that returning to 2007 output levels is a relatively low bar: Output remains about 10 percent below where it would be if it had grown in line with historical averages.\n\nGiven the sluggish recovery in national output, it is not surprising that labor markets are also healing slowly. Employment fell by 8.7 million jobs and has recovered only 3.6 million of those jobs. On an encouraging note, the national unemployment rate has recently fallen to 8.2 percent. But the fraction of people over the age of 16 who have a job, known as the employment-population ratio, is still nearly 7 percent lower than in December 2007.\n\nFinally, I should note that while output and employment remain quite low, inflation has remained remarkably close to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target. From the fourth quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2011, the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index has grown at an average annual rate of 1.8 percent. Here, I should emphasize that the PCE price index is an index that includes all goods and services, including food and energy. So, I’m not talking about so-called core inflation—I’m talking about what’s called headline inflation.\n\nThat’s a brief review of the past four years. Real output has recovered back to 2007 levels, but remains well below what one would expect it to be in light of historical growth patterns in the United States. Employment remains well below 2007 levels. Unemployment remains well above 2007 levels. Inflation has averaged close to the Fed’s target.\n\nNow, I turn to the question of how one might use these data to fashion a forecast for the next year or two. Any forecast of the future is based on an economic model—again, a story—of how the past data came to be. My story for the past four years centers on two key changes in the economy. The first is that from 2006 to 2012, households have lost trillions of dollars in wealth and net worth, as housing and other assets have fallen in value. The second is that households and firms now feel that they must stay prepared for the kind of financial market shock they experienced in 2008. I see these changes in economic conditions as improving over time, but only slowly.\n\nMany observers—including me—have emphasized how these two changes in the economy have given rise to a fall in households’ demand for consumption goods and in firms’ demand for investment goods. Fortunately, the Fed’s highly accommodative monetary policy has served to mitigate this fall in demand. The Fed’s policy has pushed downward on short-term and long-term interest rates. The lower interest rates encourage consumers to spend and firms to invest.\n\nWhat’s less often emphasized—but I think is also critical—is that the productive capacity of our country has grown much more slowly than we would have expected prior to the recession. This statement may seem strange at first blush—after all, our workers have not been harmed or injured in some fashion, and our factories have not been damaged or destroyed. But the productive capacity of a country doesn’t depend on just the number of workers and machines available. We live in a dynamic economy, in which enormous numbers of firms, plants, and jobs are continually created and destroyed. The productive capacity of our country depends on how well that dynamic process of creation and destruction—the ongoing reallocation of people and machines across economic tasks—is working. Productive capacity has grown more slowly than usual because this process of reallocation has been materially affected by the fall in household net worth and the rise in firm-level uncertainty.\n\nThis kind of damage to productive capacity takes many forms, but let me give two concrete examples of what I have in mind. New firms are a major source of employment growth in the economy. But households generally need some kind of capital of their own to initiate a startup—and so the fall in household net worth and wealth makes starting new firms more challenging. Indeed, the number of new firms has fallen sharply since 2006—and so it is not surprising that employment is lower. At the same time, existing firms’ fear of a 2008 financial market shock keeps them from hiring workers whom they might have to fire if 2008 recurred. Both of these forces—fewer startups and firms’ fear of firing—reduce the productive capacity of our economy by making it harder for destroyed jobs to be replaced by created jobs.\n\nThus, my view is that the economy has experienced both a reduction in the demand for goods and damage to its productive capacity. However, as I think about the outlook for the economy and the appropriate policy reaction to that outlook, I would also like to know which of these two changes is more responsible for the low levels of output and employment. To answer this question, I believe it is useful to look at the behavior of inflation. If the demand for goods remained below the productive capacity of the economy for multiple years, then we should see significant downward pressures on prices. Inflation should be well below the Fed’s target of 2 percent, and possibly falling. But, as I indicated earlier, this has not been the case. Hence, it does not appear that demand is significantly below the productive capacity of the United States.\n\nTo be clear, this observation does not mean that the Fed’s highly accommodative policy was unwarranted. Without that policy, I’m sure that output, employment, and prices would all be lower. After all, during the early years of the Great Depression, prices were falling at 10 percent per year. Rather, my point is that the Fed’s highly accommodative policy has kept the demand for goods relatively close to the diminished productive capacity of the economy, and so has kept inflation near 2 percent.\n\nSo, my model of the past four years is that there was a fall in demand and damage to the productive capacity of the country. Fortunately, highly accommodative monetary policy was able to keep the demand for goods close to the productive capacity of the economy, and thereby keep inflation close to the Fed’s target. What does this model imply for my outlook for the evolution of output, employment, and prices over the next four years?\n\nMy view is that it will take at least several more years for the damage to productive capacity that I’ve described to heal. Thus, I predict that output will grow only moderately, at around 2.5 percent to 3 percent in each of the next two years. This moderate growth will imply that output will remain well below what we might have expected it to be back in 2007. In a similar vein, I expect the rate of employment growth in each of the next two years to be only slightly higher than the rate of population growth. In terms of unemployment, I expect that the unemployment rate will continue to fall slowly, to around 7.7 percent at the end of this year and to around 7 percent by the end of 2013.\n\nFinally, let me turn to inflation. It is true that low household net worth and wealth will continue to represent significant headwinds for demand. Hence, I would view a highly accommodative monetary policy as being appropriate. As I will explain shortly, though, I expect that the FOMC’s policy will be even more accommodative than I would see as appropriate. Hence, I expect that the core and headline PCE inflation rates will be around 2 percent this year and rise to 2.3 percent in 2013.\n\nTo sum up: I expect output to grow at 2.5 percent to 3 percent per year in each of the next two years, unemployment to fall to around 7 percent by the end of 2013, and inflation to average over 2 percent over the next two years. How much confidence should you have in this outlook? I can give two conflicting answers to this question. First, any forecast should be viewed as only a benchmark look into the future.

My forecast for real GDP at the end of 2011 has turned out to be about 1.5 percent too high, and my forecast for unemployment at the end of 2011 was about 30 basis points too high. My forecast for headline PCE inflation has proven to be almost exactly right.\n\nI’ve described my outlook for the next two years. Now I want to use that outlook to answer three questions that I’m often asked about monetary policy.

In order to achieve these goals on an ongoing basis, it is essential that FOMC choices evolve in a systematic fashion with the state of the economy. Suppose, for example, that unemployment, and the outlook for unemployment, fall back toward long-run norms. The FOMC is doing better on its employment mandate.

            "content": "Since the start of the Great Recession, employment has fallen considerably, while average inflation has been near the Federal Reserve’s target of 2 percent. Given the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate to promote price stability and maximum employment, an obvious question is “Why does the Federal Reserve appear to be doing so much better on one mandate than the other?”\nIn this speech, I present a simple model that suggests an answer to this question. A key feature of the model is that there are two distinct types of demand shocks: labor demand shocks and product demand shocks. The labor demand shocks reflect factors such as adverse credit conditions and increased uncertainty that lead firms to demand fewer workers at a given real wage. The product demand shocks reflect factors such as a loss of wealth and a higher risk of job loss that lead households to demand fewer goods at a given real interest rate. Each of these shocks leads to a fall in employment, with the decline in employment magnified by slow adjustments in the real wage.\nWhen considering these shocks, it is important to distinguish how monetary and non-monetary policies influence the level of output and employment. In the model I employ, the Federal Reserve controls the real interest rate; lowering the real interest rate increases the demand for goods and services, and thereby influences national output and employment.\nThe first implication of the model is that monetary policy can offset the impact of the product demand shocks on employment, but it cannot offset the employment loss due to the fall in labor demand and any associated slow real wage adjustment. As a result, the level of “maximum employment” achievable through monetary policy is less than the “full employment” of labor resources.\nA second implication is that non-monetary policies specifically designed to stimulate the demand for workers (such as government subsidies for hiring) can offset some of the employment loss due to the labor demand shocks, but only if accompanied by monetary easing. That is, monetary and non-monetary policy must work in concert to reduce the impact of a decline in labor demand; neither can do it alone.\nReturning to the question posed at the beginning, this model suggests that the Federal Reserve is performing about as well as it can on both mandates. The Federal Reserve’s accommodative policy has offset much of the impact of product demand shocks and so has kept inflation near target. However, this policy has been unable to offset the large adverse shocks to labor demand. The model implies that, in terms of employment, there are limits to what monetary policy can achieve on its own.\nOn the Limits to Monetary Policy - Presentation Slides [PDF]\nReferences for Presentation Slides [PDF]\nOn the Limits to Monetary Policy\nMarch 20, 2012\nView video of the speech and the\nQ & A that followed.

As a result, the level of “maximum employment” achievable through monetary policy is less than the “full employment” of labor resources.\n\nA second implication is that non-monetary policies specifically designed to stimulate the demand for workers (such as government subsidies for hiring) can offset some of the employment loss due to the labor demand shocks, but only if accompanied by monetary easing. That is, monetary and non-monetary policy must work in concert to reduce the impact of a decline in labor demand; neither can do it alone.\n\nReturning to the question posed at the beginning, this model suggests that the Federal Reserve is performing about as well as it can on both mandates. The Federal Reserve’s accommodative policy has offset much of the impact of product demand shocks and so has kept inflation near target. However, this policy has been unable to offset the large adverse shocks to labor demand. The model implies that, in terms of employment, there are limits to what monetary policy can achieve on its own."

The theme of the speech is that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) should do more than simply decide at each meeting whether or not to buy more assets or to keep interest rates low for longer. The Committee should provide a public contingency plan—that is, provide guidance to the public on how it will respond to a variety of relevant scenarios. But how should the FOMC formulate a public contingency plan? The FOMC has two statutory mandates: to promote price stability and to promote maximum employment. Given these mandates, it makes sense for the FOMC to vary its chosen level of monetary accommodation in response to changes in current and expected inflation and current and expected unemployment.\nI find it helpful to summarize the relevant information in what I term a mandate dashboard. Here’s what the dashboard looked like in the FOMC meeting earlier this month.\nLarge Image\nI’ll explain the dashboard starting with the inflation side. The first cell from the left is current inflation. The second cell is what inflation is projected to be in one year’s time. Finally, the third cell contains a forecast for inflation in two years’ time. The unemployment side is similar. The first cell from the left is current unemployment. The second cell contains a forecast for unemployment in one year’s time, and the third cell is a forecast for unemployment in two years’ time. The various forecasts are based on the Summary of Economic Projections released by the FOMC earlier this month.\nIt is important to note that the dashboard includes information from other current variables besides inflation and unemployment. The forecasts for inflation and unemployment could potentially be based on a wide range of information—anticipated changes in fiscal policy, changes in European financial markets and so on. So, basing policy on the mandate dashboard does allow policy to react to changes in these other economic variables. However, using this kind of dashboard does require monetary policy to respond to any economic variable only insofar as that variable affects current and future inflation or unemployment. This restriction seems appropriate given the limited nature of the FOMC’s statutory assignment from Congress.\nGiven this mandate dashboard, how should the level of monetary accommodation evolve over time in response to changes in the dashboard’s readings? In general, the answer to this question is subtle, because it depends on how the FOMC weights its two mandates. However, there are two common cases in which the mandate dashboard becomes straightforward to use. Suppose current and expected inflation rise and current and expected unemployment fall, as is often true in a recovery. Then, regardless of how it weights its two mandates, the FOMC should reduce the level of accommodation. Alternatively, suppose inflation and expected inflation go down and unemployment and expected unemployment go up, as is often true when the economy slows. Then, regardless of how it weights its two mandates, the FOMC should increase the level of accommodation.\nA public contingency plan for 2012 would specify how the FOMC would act in a number of scenarios for the mandate dashboard in a year’s time. It’s useful to start with the FOMC’s projected scenario for 2012.\nLarge Image\nNotice that the second cell for the November 2012 row is the forecast for inflation over the course of 2013, and the second cell for the November 2011 row is the forecast for inflation over the course of 2012.

Accordingly, the dashboard keeps track of what we expect the economy to be like in a year or two.\nIf we compare the second row with the first, we see that in this scenario, core inflation is about the same in a year’s time as it is now. Unemployment is lower. These changes imply that the Committee should reduce the level of monetary accommodation over the coming year. But, like those of many private sector forecasters, the FOMC’s projections have proven imperfect over the past few years. With that in mind, the Committee should provide guidance to the public about how it will respond to unexpected changes in the mandate dashboard.

In a speech given in May 2010, Chairman Bernanke stated, “Transparency regarding monetary policy … not only helps make central banks more accountable, it also increases the effectiveness of policy.”1 I agree completely with this sentiment.

            "content": "Thank you for that generous introduction. It’s a huge pleasure to be back in Winnipeg. I’ve been gone a long time. How long? After living here for 13 years, I moved back to the States right after the Winnipeg Jets won their last AVCO Cup as champions of the World Hockey Association—that is, 1979. Consequently, my words today will be those of an American policymaker speaking on American policy issues. More specifically, I’ll provide a look back at Federal Reserve decision-making over the past few years. However, I’ll close with my views on how I think that the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—can work to reduce the level of uncertainty surrounding future monetary policymaking. As always, any views I express here today are my own, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System, including my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\nSome FOMC Basics\nLet me begin with some basics about the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts, and by area, we’re the second largest. Our district includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\nEight times per year, the FOMC meets to set the path of monetary policy over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board, including Chairman Bernanke, contribute to these deliberations. (Currently, there are only five governors—two positions are unfilled.) However, the Committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a group of four other presidents that rotates annually. Right now, that last group consists of the presidents from the Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Dallas and Chicago Federal Reserve Banks.\nI’ve said that the FOMC meets (at least) eight times per year. But how do these meetings work? At a typical meeting, there are two so-called go-rounds, in which every president and every governor has the opportunity to speak without interruption. The first of these is referred to as the economics go-round. It is kicked off by a presentation on current economic conditions by Federal Reserve staff economists. Then, the presidents and governors describe their individual views on current economic conditions and their respective outlooks for future economic conditions. The presidents typically start by providing information about their district’s local economic performance. We get that information from our research staffs, but also from our interactions with business and community leaders in industries and towns from across our districts.\nThe Committee next turns to the second go-round, which focuses on policy. Again, the staff begins, with a presentation of policy options. After that, each of the 17 meeting participants has a chance to speak on what each views as the appropriate policy choice. This set of remarks is followed with a summary by the chairman, in which he lays out what he sees as the Committee’s consensus view for future policy. The voting members of the FOMC then cast their votes on this policy statement and thereby set monetary policy for the next six to seven weeks.\nThis description of an FOMC meeting highlights how the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government. Representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations. And, as I’ve described, their input relies critically on information received from district residents. In this way, the Federal Reserve System is deliberately designed to give the residents of Main Street a voice in national monetary policy.\nFOMC Objectives\nI’ve said that FOMC participants seek to adopt what they view as the appropriate policy choice. That provides a natural segue into my next topic: the policy objectives of the FOMC. The FOMC has a dual mandate, established by Congress: to set monetary policy so as to promote price stability and maximum employment. The heart of the price stability mandate is the Federal Reserve’s inflation objective. The FOMC communicates its inflation objective to the public in a number of ways. Most prominently, at quarterly intervals, FOMC meeting participants publicly reveal their forecasts for inflation in the longer run (maybe five or six years), assuming that monetary policy is optimal. Those forecasts usually range between 1.5 percent and 2 percent per year. They are often collectively referred to by saying that the Federal Reserve views inflation as being “mandate-consistent” if it is running at “2 percent or a bit under.”\nCongress has also mandated that the FOMC set monetary policy so as to promote maximum employment. An important and ongoing communications challenge for the FOMC is that it is much harder to quantify the maximum employment mandate than the price stability mandate. Changes in minimum wage policy, demography, taxes and regulations, technological productivity, job market efficiency, unemployment insurance benefits, entrepreneurial credit access and social norms all influence what we might consider “maximum employment.” Trying to offset these changes in the economy with monetary policy can lead to a dangerous drift in inflationary expectations and ultimately in inflation itself.\nLooking Back over the Past Four Years: Actions\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research’s Business Cycle Dating Committee serves as the official arbiter of precisely when recessions begin and end in the United States.1The committee has determined that what is commonly referred to as the Great Recession began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009. During that time period, real gross domestic product (that is, GDP adjusted for inflation) fell by 5 percent and unemployment nearly doubled.\nThe Federal Reserve responded to the Great Recession and the associated financial crisis in a number of ways that fall roughly into two classes. First, the Fed engaged in a vast amount of lending to firms believed to be in sound condition. It lent through conventional vehicles like the discount window and currency swaps with foreign central banks. But it also lent through relatively unconventional vehicles like the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility.2 Second, the Fed lowered the real interest rate facing borrowers and lenders.\nHere, I should clarify some terminology. By the term “real interest rate,” I’m referring to the interest rate received by lenders net of inflation. Thus, if the interest rate on the loan is 5 percent per year and lenders expect inflation to be around 2 percent, the real interest rate is roughly 3 percent. Economists generally think that it’s the real interest rate that matters for economic decision-making.\nI’ll first discuss the Fed’s lending responses and then talk about the interest rate cuts.\nLending\nTo understand the Fed’s lending response to the events of 2007-09, we need to step back to the second half of 2006. At that time, firms and people around the world held a wide array of financial assets that were ultimately backed by U.S. residential land. They viewed those assets as being largely risk-free. Investors may have understood that a fall in the value of U.S. land would impose large losses on them. However, they put low odds on such a decline taking place. Rather, they seemed to believe that U.S. land prices would continue to rise at a steady clip, as they had over the preceding 10 years.\nBy the second half of 2007, that belief began to unravel in the face of incoming data. People were learning the hard way that U.S. land was a risky investment. Now the only question was how risky. That uncertainty planted the seeds for global financial panic.\nWhat do I mean by the term “financial panic”? Financial panics are events that blur the line between liquidity and solvency. A firm is solvent if its revenues (in a discounted present-value sense) exceed its expenditures. A firm is liquid if it is able to raise enough funds—either by borrowing or by selling assets—to pay its current costs. In a financial market that is functioning well, solvent firms are typically liquid because they can borrow against their future profits. During a financial panic, however, lenders feel unable to assess the future profits and/or collateral of borrowers. Borrowing becomes highly constrained, credit markets cease to function as well, and even highly solvent firms may become illiquid.\nAs I’ve said, many forms of collateral around the world were either implicitly or explicitly backed by U.S. residential land in the mid-2000s. But by mid-2007, as those land prices fell, financial markets became increasingly uncertain about how to evaluate mortgage-backed securities and other assets backed by U.S. land. That translated into uncertainty about the ultimate solvency of institutions holding those assets—and then about the ultimate solvency of any of their creditors. Spreads in credit markets between Treasury returns and other bond returns began to widen—at first slightly and then alarmingly as the panic conditions took firmer hold.\nMost economists agree that central banks should respond to financial panics by communicating that they are willing to lend freely to solvent firms, against a wide range of good collateral, at some kind of penalty rate. This policy is useful for two reasons. First, it provides a source of funds to potential borrowers who are illiquid but nonetheless solvent. Second, it provides a floor to collateral valuation. Private lenders know that they can always use collateral seized from a defaulting borrower as a vehicle to borrow money from the central bank. That baseline use serves to spur private lending.\nBeginning in mid-2007, the Fed took a number of actions consistent with this operating principle. It lent money to financial institutions through the discount window and its close cousin, the Term Auction Facility. It injected liquidity into a broad range of essential credit markets through a veritable alphabet soup of special lending vehicles. In some sense, these interventions were typical for a central bank operating in the context of a financial panic. But the size of the problem meant that the operations were unprecedented in their scale. The interventions ultimately made up more than $1 trillion of Federal Reserve assets.\nThere is no doubt that these interventions saved many solvent firms from collapse during the financial crisis. Over time, panic eased and spreads in financial markets normalized. Once that happened, the private sector stopped borrowing from the Fed because it found the Fed’s penalty rates too onerous. As a result, the Fed shut down its special lending facilities in 2010.\nIt is plausible that the Fed’s loans through the various special facilities exposed it—and by extension, the American public—to some risk of loss. However, it is difficult to know how much risk was involved. We generally try to measure a financial asset’s risk by the spread between its yield and that of a safe benchmark like U.S. Treasuries. But as I’ve mentioned, in a financial panic a relatively large fraction of such a spread is attributable to illiquidity as opposed to intrinsic risk. The goal of the central bank’s intervention is exactly to eliminate this panic-driven illiquidity. Accordingly, we cannot gauge the Fed’s risk exposures without somehow correcting spreads for this illiquidity factor. Calculating this, however, is extremely difficult. What we can say with certainty is that the Fed has not lost a penny on any of these transactions: All such loans have been repaid in full.\nI should be careful to distinguish the lending that I’ve described from the institution-specific assistance the Federal Reserve provided to firms like AIG. These institution-specific interventions were deemed necessary by the Fed and the Bush administration because they believed that there were no adequate procedures in place for liquidating the assets of systemically important financial institutions in an orderly fashion. In 2010, the U.S. Congress passed an act that provides these procedures. Simultaneously—and correctly—the Congress removes the Fed’s ability to engage in institution-specific assistance. The act does leave in place the Fed’s ability to engage in broad-based market interventions of the kind that I’ve described, albeit with more congressional and White House oversight. This ability of the Fed could be useful in the event that financial market turmoil in other parts of the world ever threatens to spread to U.S. credit and capital markets.\nCutting Interest Rates\nI’ve talked about how the fall in land prices generated a sharp increase in risk perceptions in financial markets and how that in turn led to a financial crisis. I now want to turn to what I see as the second key effect of the fall in land prices. This fall reduced the net worth of many households and firms. According to Fed calculations, household net worth fell by over 25 percent from the second quarter of 2007 to the first quarter of 2009. Households responded to this change in their balance sheets by forgoing consumption, which led in turn to a fall in output and employment,3 and put downward pressure on the price level.\nThe FOMC reacted by lowering its target interest rate from 5.25 percent in August 2007 to a range of 0 to 0.25 percent in December 2008; it now remains at this lower bound. Since inflation expectations remained stable, the FOMC’s action has had the effect of lowering the real interest rate facing households. Households, of course, typically respond to lower rates by saving less and demanding more consumption. Similarly, firms undertake more investment projects. In this way, the FOMC can and has partially offset the impact on the economy of the loss of net worth.\nIndeed, the FOMC would probably have liked to respond by cutting its target interest rate still further. The problem is that this target interest rate cannot go below zero. Instead, the FOMC has engaged in large-scale purchases of long-term assets issued or backed by the government. The goal of these transactions is to lower long-term real interest rates and again offset the impact on the economy of the net worth shock.\nSo, to sum up, the fall in land prices triggered an increase in risk perceptions and a decrease in household net worth. The increase in risk led to a major financial crisis, which the Federal Reserve addressed through a large amount of broad-based lending. The decrease in net worth led to a major recession and ongoing slow recovery. The Federal Reserve’s reduction in interest rates has lessened the impact of this change in net worth.\nLooking Back over the Past Four Years: Outcomes\nHow has the Federal Reserve performed relative to its dual mandate over the past four years, since the onset of the Great Recession at the end of 2007? In terms of price stability, the answer is remarkably well. The personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation rate has averaged 1.8 percent per year from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the third quarter of 2011. In my view, this outcome is essentially consistent with price stability.\nNow, I want to be clear here about what I mean when I say “inflation.” That number I just gave you, 1.8 percent per year for nearly four years, refers to what’s termed headline inflation. It includes all goods and services, including food and energy. When the Fed says that it is committed to keeping inflation at 2 percent or a little less, it means prices for all goods and services, including the gas we put in our cars and the food we put on our tables. When we make reference to year-over-year core inflation—that is, inflation without food and energy—it’s only because we believe that core inflation is a helpful predictor of headline inflation over the next three or four years.\nIt is important, I think, to understand why there is no longer an intrinsic connection between the size of the Fed’s balance sheet and inflation. In the past three years, the Fed has bought over $2 trillion of securities issued or backed by the government. The Fed has funded that purchase by tripling the amount of deposits held by banks with the Fed—what are called bank reserves.\nThe standard reasoning is that this kind of reserve creation is inflationary. Banks are only allowed to offer checkable deposits in proportion to their reserves. Economists view checkable deposits as a form of money because, like cash, checkable deposits make many transactions easier. In this sense, bank reserves held with the Fed are essentially licenses for banks to create a certain amount of money. By giving out more licenses, the FOMC is allowing banks to create more money. And if you took any economics in school you learned: More money chasing the same number of goods—voilà, inflation.\nBut this connection between bank reserves and inflation is simply not operative right now. Banks have few good lending opportunities, and so they’re not trying to attract deposits. As a result, they are keeping nearly $1.6 trillion of reserves at the Fed in excess of what they need to back their deposits. In other words, banks have the licenses to create money, but are choosing not to do so.\nI’m confident, though, that at some point in the future, the economy will improve and banks will once again have good lending opportunities. Some observers are concerned that once this happens, the banks’ excess reserves will serve as kindling for an inflationary fire. This concern would have been entirely appropriate three years ago. But in October 2008, Congress granted the Federal Reserve the power to pay interest on bank reserves. Right now, that interest rate is 25 basis points, or 0.25 percent. By raising that rate judiciously, the Fed has the ability to deter banks from using their reserves to create money, and through this mechanism, the Fed can prevent inflation. The Fed’s ability to pay interest on reserves means that the old and familiar link between increased bank reserves and higher inflation has been broken.\nOf course, this requires the Fed to raise the interest rate on reserves in response to changes in economic conditions. You might well ask: Will the Fed raise interest rates in a sufficiently timely and effective manner to keep inflation at 2 percent or a little less? But that’s always been the key question to ask about Fed policy, even when the Fed had a much smaller balance sheet. And that’s my point: Because the Fed can pay interest on reserves, the size of its balance sheet does not, in and of itself, undercut the credibility of its commitment to keep inflation at 2 percent or a bit under. I believe that’s why both survey and market-based measures of expected inflation over the next five to 10 years have remained remarkably stable as the Fed has expanded its liabilities.\nIn terms of the Fed’s employment mandate: Unemployment remains disturbingly high at 9 percent. But—and this is important to keep in mind—it would likely be much higher without Federal Reserve interventions. Suppose the Fed had not followed its aggressive lending policies or its imaginative forms of monetary accommodation. What would have happened to the economy? While a definitive answer is impossible, the evidence from the Great Depression is suggestive. In the early years of the Great Depression, the United States was on the gold standard and the Fed could not easily adjust the quantity of bank reserves. As a result, the Fed did not engage in broad-based lending during the 1929-33 period. Nor did it cut interest rates aggressively. By 1933, hosts of financial institutions had failed, real GDP had fallen by over 25 percent, unemployment was 25 percent and the nation had experienced annual double-digit rates of deflation. The Fed’s passiveness in 1929-33 was associated with an economic catastrophe.\nLet me summarize my review of Federal Reserve performance since the beginning of the Great Recession in December 2007. My assessment is that, despite profound economic shocks, the Federal Reserve—led by Chairman Bernanke—has successfully met its price stability mandate through its lending programs and through innovative forms of monetary accommodation. These actions also helped keep the unemployment rate from rising even higher. As part of its accommodative policy, the FOMC has greatly expanded its balance sheet. But it is important to understand that this expansion need not trigger inflation now or in the future, because the Federal Reserve can now pay interest on bank reserves.\nGoing Forward\nI’ve spent most of this speech looking back. Let me close by offering some thoughts about future policy.\nI’ve underscored the Federal Reserve’s success in meeting its price stability mandate over the past four years. And the Fed’s actions have helped keep unemployment from rising higher. But the unemployment rate, currently 9 percent, remains disturbingly high—and FOMC meeting participants are projecting that it will fall to only about 8 percent over the next two years.\nThe FOMC does have tools remaining. It could put downward pressure on long-term market interest rates in at least two ways. First, it could buy more long-term Treasury securities or securities issued by government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Second, the Committee could extend its prediction for how long it will keep its target short-term interest rate exceptionally low. So, tools—and choices—remain.\nHowever, the FOMC should do more than simply decide at each meeting whether or not to buy more assets or to keep interest rates low for longer. Any current decision is based on the FOMC’s forecast of the future, and no forecast can be perfect. The Committee should provide a public contingency plan—that is, provide clear guidance on how it will respond to a variety of relevant scenarios. For example, the Committee recently projected that in 2011, core inflation will be 1.9 percent and that it will fall back in 2012 and 2013 to around 1.7 percent. Suppose hypothetically that core inflation, and the outlook for core inflation, has risen to 3 percent by the end of 2013, while unemployment has fallen to between 8 percent and 8.5 percent. A public contingency plan would allow the public to know what the Committee intends to do in that eventuality.\nI believe that public contingency planning will have many benefits. Let me mention two. First, in recent statements and speeches, I have described why the FOMC actions in August and September seemed inconsistent with the evolution of the macroeconomic data in 2011. This kind of inconsistency is much less likely to occur once the FOMC has formulated an explicit public contingency plan. Second, I’ve heard from businesses that policy uncertainty is curbing their incentive to hire or invest. Similarly, I’ve heard from consumers that policy uncertainty is curbing their incentive to spend. A public FOMC contingency plan can help reduce the level of policy uncertainty being created by the Fed.\nNo contingency plan can ever be definitive. Inevitably, the FOMC will learn things that it did not expect to learn. And so there may be conditions that force the FOMC to deviate from a chosen plan. However, having a public plan, and couching its decisions against the backdrop of that plan, will enhance Federal Reserve transparency, credibility, accountability and consistency.\nThank you for listening. I’d be happy to take your questions.\nEndnotes\n1 See National Bureau of Economic Research’s Business Cycle Dating Committee.\n2 See Willardson (2008) and Willardson and Pederson (2010).\n3 See Kocherlakota (2010) for a more extensive discussion of the relevant transmission mechanisms.\nReferences\nKocherlakota, Narayana R. 2010. “Two Models of Land Overvaluation and Their Implications.” Presented at “A Return to Jekyll Island: The Origins, History, and Future of the Federal Reserve,” Jekyll Island, Ga.\nWillardson, Niel. 2008. “Actions to Restore Financial Stability.” The Region (December), Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.\nWillardson, Niel, and LuAnne Pederson. 2010. “Federal Reserve Liquidity Programs: An Update.” The Region (June), Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.\n\nThank you for that generous introduction. It’s a huge pleasure to be back in Winnipeg. I’ve been gone a long time. How long? After living here for 13 years, I moved back to the States right after the Winnipeg Jets won their last AVCO Cup as champions of the World Hockey Association—that is, 1979. Consequently, my words today will be those of an American policymaker speaking on American policy issues. More specifically, I’ll provide a look back at Federal Reserve decision-making over the past few years. However, I’ll close with my views on how I think that the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—can work to reduce the level of uncertainty surrounding future monetary policymaking. As always, any views I express here today are my own, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System, including my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nLet me begin with some basics about the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts, and by area, we’re the second largest. Our district includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\n\nEight times per year, the FOMC meets to set the path of monetary policy over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board, including Chairman Bernanke, contribute to these deliberations. (Currently, there are only five governors—two positions are unfilled.) However, the Committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a group of four other presidents that rotates annually. Right now, that last group consists of the presidents from the Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Dallas and Chicago Federal Reserve Banks.\n\nI’ve said that the FOMC meets (at least) eight times per year. But how do these meetings work? At a typical meeting, there are two so-called go-rounds, in which every president and every governor has the opportunity to speak without interruption. The first of these is referred to as the economics go-round. It is kicked off by a presentation on current economic conditions by Federal Reserve staff economists. Then, the presidents and governors describe their individual views on current economic conditions and their respective outlooks for future economic conditions. The presidents typically start by providing information about their district’s local economic performance. We get that information from our research staffs, but also from our interactions with business and community leaders in industries and towns from across our districts.\n\nThe Committee next turns to the second go-round, which focuses on policy. Again, the staff begins, with a presentation of policy options. After that, each of the 17 meeting participants has a chance to speak on what each views as the appropriate policy choice. This set of remarks is followed with a summary by the chairman, in which he lays out what he sees as the Committee’s consensus view for future policy. The voting members of the FOMC then cast their votes on this policy statement and thereby set monetary policy for the next six to seven weeks.\n\nThis description of an FOMC meeting highlights how the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government. Representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations. And, as I’ve described, their input relies critically on information received from district residents. In this way, the Federal Reserve System is deliberately designed to give the residents of Main Street a voice in national monetary policy.\n\nI’ve said that FOMC participants seek to adopt what they view as the appropriate policy choice. That provides a natural segue into my next topic: the policy objectives of the FOMC. The FOMC has a dual mandate, established by Congress: to set monetary policy so as to promote price stability and maximum employment. The heart of the price stability mandate is the Federal Reserve’s inflation objective. The FOMC communicates its inflation objective to the public in a number of ways. Most prominently, at quarterly intervals, FOMC meeting participants publicly reveal their forecasts for inflation in the longer run (maybe five or six years), assuming that monetary policy is optimal. Those forecasts usually range between 1.5 percent and 2 percent per year. They are often collectively referred to by saying that the Federal Reserve views inflation as being “mandate-consistent” if it is running at “2 percent or a bit under.”\n\nCongress has also mandated that the FOMC set monetary policy so as to promote maximum employment. An important and ongoing communications challenge for the FOMC is that it is much harder to quantify the maximum employment mandate than the price stability mandate. Changes in minimum wage policy, demography, taxes and regulations, technological productivity, job market efficiency, unemployment insurance benefits, entrepreneurial credit access and social norms all influence what we might consider “maximum employment.” Trying to offset these changes in the economy with monetary policy can lead to a dangerous drift in inflationary expectations and ultimately in inflation itself.\n\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research’s Business Cycle Dating Committee serves as the official arbiter of precisely when recessions begin and end in the United States.1The committee has determined that what is commonly referred to as the Great Recession began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009. During that time period, real gross domestic product (that is, GDP adjusted for inflation) fell by 5 percent and unemployment nearly doubled.\n\nThe Federal Reserve responded to the Great Recession and the associated financial crisis in a number of ways that fall roughly into two classes. First, the Fed engaged in a vast amount of lending to firms believed to be in sound condition. It lent through conventional vehicles like the discount window and currency swaps with foreign central banks. But it also lent through relatively unconventional vehicles like the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility.2 Second, the Fed lowered the real interest rate facing borrowers and lenders.\n\nHere, I should clarify some terminology. By the term “real interest rate,” I’m referring to the interest rate received by lenders net of inflation. Thus, if the interest rate on the loan is 5 percent per year and lenders expect inflation to be around 2 percent, the real interest rate is roughly 3 percent. Economists generally think that it’s the real interest rate that matters for economic decision-making.\n\nI’ll first discuss the Fed’s lending responses and then talk about the interest rate cuts.\n\nTo understand the Fed’s lending response to the events of 2007-09, we need to step back to the second half of 2006. At that time, firms and people around the world held a wide array of financial assets that were ultimately backed by U.S. residential land. They viewed those assets as being largely risk-free. Investors may have understood that a fall in the value of U.S. land would impose large losses on them. However, they put low odds on such a decline taking place. Rather, they seemed to believe that U.S. land prices would continue to rise at a steady clip, as they had over the preceding 10 years.\n\nBy the second half of 2007, that belief began to unravel in the face of incoming data. People were learning the hard way that U.S. land was a risky investment. Now the only question was how risky. That uncertainty planted the seeds for global financial panic.\n\nWhat do I mean by the term “financial panic”? Financial panics are events that blur the line between liquidity and solvency. A firm is solvent if its revenues (in a discounted present-value sense) exceed its expenditures. A firm is liquid if it is able to raise enough funds—either by borrowing or by selling assets—to pay its current costs. In a financial market that is functioning well, solvent firms are typically liquid because they can borrow against their future profits. During a financial panic, however, lenders feel unable to assess the future profits and/or collateral of borrowers. Borrowing becomes highly constrained, credit markets cease to function as well, and even highly solvent firms may become illiquid.\n\nAs I’ve said, many forms of collateral around the world were either implicitly or explicitly backed by U.S. residential land in the mid-2000s. But by mid-2007, as those land prices fell, financial markets became increasingly uncertain about how to evaluate mortgage-backed securities and other assets backed by U.S. land. That translated into uncertainty about the ultimate solvency of institutions holding those assets—and then about the ultimate solvency of any of their creditors. Spreads in credit markets between Treasury returns and other bond returns began to widen—at first slightly and then alarmingly as the panic conditions took firmer hold.\n\nMost economists agree that central banks should respond to financial panics by communicating that they are willing to lend freely to solvent firms, against a wide range of good collateral, at some kind of penalty rate. This policy is useful for two reasons. First, it provides a source of funds to potential borrowers who are illiquid but nonetheless solvent. Second, it provides a floor to collateral valuation. Private lenders know that they can always use collateral seized from a defaulting borrower as a vehicle to borrow money from the central bank. That baseline use serves to spur private lending.\n\nBeginning in mid-2007, the Fed took a number of actions consistent with this operating principle. It lent money to financial institutions through the discount window and its close cousin, the Term Auction Facility. It injected liquidity into a broad range of essential credit markets through a veritable alphabet soup of special lending vehicles. In some sense, these interventions were typical for a central bank operating in the context of a financial panic. But the size of the problem meant that the operations were unprecedented in their scale. The interventions ultimately made up more than $1 trillion of Federal Reserve assets.\n\nThere is no doubt that these interventions saved many solvent firms from collapse during the financial crisis. Over time, panic eased and spreads in financial markets normalized. Once that happened, the private sector stopped borrowing from the Fed because it found the Fed’s penalty rates too onerous. As a result, the Fed shut down its special lending facilities in 2010.\n\nIt is plausible that the Fed’s loans through the various special facilities exposed it—and by extension, the American public—to some risk of loss. However, it is difficult to know how much risk was involved. We generally try to measure a financial asset’s risk by the spread between its yield and that of a safe benchmark like U.S. Treasuries. But as I’ve mentioned, in a financial panic a relatively large fraction of such a spread is attributable to illiquidity as opposed to intrinsic risk. The goal of the central bank’s intervention is exactly to eliminate this panic-driven illiquidity. Accordingly, we cannot gauge the Fed’s risk exposures without somehow correcting spreads for this illiquidity factor. Calculating this, however, is extremely difficult. What we can say with certainty is that the Fed has not lost a penny on any of these transactions: All such loans have been repaid in full.\n\nI should be careful to distinguish the lending that I’ve described from the institution-specific assistance the Federal Reserve provided to firms like AIG. These institution-specific interventions were deemed necessary by the Fed and the Bush administration because they believed that there were no adequate procedures in place for liquidating the assets of systemically important financial institutions in an orderly fashion. In 2010, the U.S. Congress passed an act that provides these procedures. Simultaneously—and correctly—the Congress removes the Fed’s ability to engage in institution-specific assistance. The act does leave in place the Fed’s ability to engage in broad-based market interventions of the kind that I’ve described, albeit with more congressional and White House oversight. This ability of the Fed could be useful in the event that financial market turmoil in other parts of the world ever threatens to spread to U.S. credit and capital markets.\n\nI’ve talked about how the fall in land prices generated a sharp increase in risk perceptions in financial markets and how that in turn led to a financial crisis. I now want to turn to what I see as the second key effect of the fall in land prices. This fall reduced the net worth of many households and firms. According to Fed calculations, household net worth fell by over 25 percent from the second quarter of 2007 to the first quarter of 2009. Households responded to this change in their balance sheets by forgoing consumption, which led in turn to a fall in output and employment,3 and put downward pressure on the price level.\n\nThe FOMC reacted by lowering its target interest rate from 5.25 percent in August 2007 to a range of 0 to 0.25 percent in December 2008; it now remains at this lower bound. Since inflation expectations remained stable, the FOMC’s action has had the effect of lowering the real interest rate facing households. Households, of course, typically respond to lower rates by saving less and demanding more consumption. Similarly, firms undertake more investment projects. In this way, the FOMC can and has partially offset the impact on the economy of the loss of net worth.\n\nIndeed, the FOMC would probably have liked to respond by cutting its target interest rate still further. The problem is that this target interest rate cannot go below zero. Instead, the FOMC has engaged in large-scale purchases of long-term assets issued or backed by the government. The goal of these transactions is to lower long-term real interest rates and again offset the impact on the economy of the net worth shock.\n\nSo, to sum up, the fall in land prices triggered an increase in risk perceptions and a decrease in household net worth. The increase in risk led to a major financial crisis, which the Federal Reserve addressed through a large amount of broad-based lending. The decrease in net worth led to a major recession and ongoing slow recovery. The Federal Reserve’s reduction in interest rates has lessened the impact of this change in net worth.\n\nHow has the Federal Reserve performed relative to its dual mandate over the past four years, since the onset of the Great Recession at the end of 2007? In terms of price stability, the answer is remarkably well. The personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation rate has averaged 1.8 percent per year from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the third quarter of 2011. In my view, this outcome is essentially consistent with price stability.\n\nNow, I want to be clear here about what I mean when I say “inflation.” That number I just gave you, 1.8 percent per year for nearly four years, refers to what’s termed headline inflation. It includes all goods and services, including food and energy. When the Fed says that it is committed to keeping inflation at 2 percent or a little less, it means prices for all goods and services, including the gas we put in our cars and the food we put on our tables. When we make reference to year-over-year core inflation—that is, inflation without food and energy—it’s only because we believe that core inflation is a helpful predictor of headline inflation over the next three or four years.\n\nIt is important, I think, to understand why there is no longer an intrinsic connection between the size of the Fed’s balance sheet and inflation. In the past three years, the Fed has bought over $2 trillion of securities issued or backed by the government. The Fed has funded that purchase by tripling the amount of deposits held by banks with the Fed—what are called bank reserves.\n\nThe standard reasoning is that this kind of reserve creation is inflationary. Banks are only allowed to offer checkable deposits in proportion to their reserves. Economists view checkable deposits as a form of money because, like cash, checkable deposits make many transactions easier. In this sense, bank reserves held with the Fed are essentially licenses for banks to create a certain amount of money. By giving out more licenses, the FOMC is allowing banks to create more money. And if you took any economics in school you learned: More money chasing the same number of goods—voilà, inflation.\n\nBut this connection between bank reserves and inflation is simply not operative right now. Banks have few good lending opportunities, and so they’re not trying to attract deposits. As a result, they are keeping nearly $1.6 trillion of reserves at the Fed in excess of what they need to back their deposits. In other words, banks have the licenses to create money, but are choosing not to do so.\n\nI’m confident, though, that at some point in the future, the economy will improve and banks will once again have good lending opportunities. Some observers are concerned that once this happens, the banks’ excess reserves will serve as kindling for an inflationary fire. This concern would have been entirely appropriate three years ago. But in October 2008, Congress granted the Federal Reserve the power to pay interest on bank reserves. Right now, that interest rate is 25 basis points, or 0.25 percent. By raising that rate judiciously, the Fed has the ability to deter banks from using their reserves to create money, and through this mechanism, the Fed can prevent inflation. The Fed’s ability to pay interest on reserves means that the old and familiar link between increased bank reserves and higher inflation has been broken.\n\nOf course, this requires the Fed to raise the interest rate on reserves in response to changes in economic conditions. You might well ask: Will the Fed raise interest rates in a sufficiently timely and effective manner to keep inflation at 2 percent or a little less? But that’s always been the key question to ask about Fed policy, even when the Fed had a much smaller balance sheet. And that’s my point: Because the Fed can pay interest on reserves, the size of its balance sheet does not, in and of itself, undercut the credibility of its commitment to keep inflation at 2 percent or a bit under. I believe that’s why both survey and market-based measures of expected inflation over the next five to 10 years have remained remarkably stable as the Fed has expanded its liabilities.\n\nIn terms of the Fed’s employment mandate: Unemployment remains disturbingly high at 9 percent. But—and this is important to keep in mind—it would likely be much higher without Federal Reserve interventions. Suppose the Fed had not followed its aggressive lending policies or its imaginative forms of monetary accommodation. What would have happened to the economy? While a definitive answer is impossible, the evidence from the Great Depression is suggestive. In the early years of the Great Depression, the United States was on the gold standard and the Fed could not easily adjust the quantity of bank reserves. As a result, the Fed did not engage in broad-based lending during the 1929-33 period. Nor did it cut interest rates aggressively. By 1933, hosts of financial institutions had failed, real GDP had fallen by over 25 percent, unemployment was 25 percent and the nation had experienced annual double-digit rates of deflation. The Fed’s passiveness in 1929-33 was associated with an economic catastrophe.\n\nLet me summarize my review of Federal Reserve performance since the beginning of the Great Recession in December 2007. My assessment is that, despite profound economic shocks, the Federal Reserve—led by Chairman Bernanke—has successfully met its price stability mandate through its lending programs and through innovative forms of monetary accommodation. These actions also helped keep the unemployment rate from rising even higher. As part of its accommodative policy, the FOMC has greatly expanded its balance sheet. But it is important to understand that this expansion need not trigger inflation now or in the future, because the Federal Reserve can now pay interest on bank reserves.\n\nI’ve spent most of this speech looking back. Let me close by offering some thoughts about future policy.\n\nI’ve underscored the Federal Reserve’s success in meeting its price stability mandate over the past four years. And the Fed’s actions have helped keep unemployment from rising higher. But the unemployment rate, currently 9 percent, remains disturbingly high—and FOMC meeting participants are projecting that it will fall to only about 8 percent over the next two years.\n\nThe FOMC does have tools remaining. It could put downward pressure on long-term market interest rates in at least two ways. First, it could buy more long-term Treasury securities or securities issued by government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Second, the Committee could extend its prediction for how long it will keep its target short-term interest rate exceptionally low. So, tools—and choices—remain.\n\nHowever, the FOMC should do more than simply decide at each meeting whether or not to buy more assets or to keep interest rates low for longer. Any current decision is based on the FOMC’s forecast of the future, and no forecast can be perfect. The Committee should provide a public contingency plan—that is, provide clear guidance on how it will respond to a variety of relevant scenarios. For example, the Committee recently projected that in 2011, core inflation will be 1.9 percent and that it will fall back in 2012 and 2013 to around 1.7 percent. Suppose hypothetically that core inflation, and the outlook for core inflation, has risen to 3 percent by the end of 2013, while unemployment has fallen to between 8 percent and 8.5 percent. A public contingency plan would allow the public to know what the Committee intends to do in that eventuality.\n\nI believe that public contingency planning will have many benefits. Let me mention two. First, in recent statements and speeches, I have described why the FOMC actions in August and September seemed inconsistent with the evolution of the macroeconomic data in 2011. This kind of inconsistency is much less likely to occur once the FOMC has formulated an explicit public contingency plan. Second, I’ve heard from businesses that policy uncertainty is curbing their incentive to hire or invest. Similarly, I’ve heard from consumers that policy uncertainty is curbing their incentive to spend. A public FOMC contingency plan can help reduce the level of policy uncertainty being created by the Fed.\n\nNo contingency plan can ever be definitive. Inevitably, the FOMC will learn things that it did not expect to learn. And so there may be conditions that force the FOMC to deviate from a chosen plan. However, having a public plan, and couching its decisions against the backdrop of that plan, will enhance Federal Reserve transparency, credibility, accountability and consistency.\n\nThank you for listening. I’d be happy to take your questions."

            "content": "Note1\nThank you for that generous introduction, John. As Paul Drake described earlier, the board of directors of the Helena Branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is meeting here in Sidney to commemorate John Franklin’s last meeting as a member of that board. I would like to take this opportunity to publicly thank John for his generous service to the Federal Reserve, as well as other members of the board, past and present. It is important for people to realize that the Federal Reserve is represented by dedicated citizens like John and his colleagues on all of the System’s bank and branch boards. In addition, each Federal Reserve bank has a number of advisory councils representing Main Street businesses, agricultural producers, labor groups and community banks and thrifts, among other constituencies. As I will describe later, the input from these citizens plays an important role in the development of monetary policy. So thank you, once again, to John and the rest of the Helena board of directors, as well as others in the audience who have served us so well.\nI’d also like to offer congratulations, on behalf of myself and the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, to Thomas Sargent and Christopher Sims, winners of the 2011 Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. In the 1970s, in separate research, Sargent and Sims developed systematic approaches to distinguishing between cause and effect in macroeconomic data. Now, almost 40 years later, their thinking informs the making of macroeconomic policy around the world. I’m especially proud that much of the work recognized by the prize committee was done at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and the University of Minnesota. My predecessors at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis deliberately fostered a research environment that could give rise to such important work, and this tradition continues today.\nIn the rest of my remarks today, I’d like to touch on several topics. I’ll begin with a quick description of the structure of the Federal Reserve System and the deliberative process of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed’s policymaking group. Then I’ll describe the FOMC’s objectives and discuss its recent performance with regard to those objectives. I’ll close with a discussion of my dissents on recent FOMC decisions. After that, I’ll be pleased to answer any questions you may have. And before I begin, I should remind you that my comments here today reflect my views alone and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System, including my FOMC colleagues.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts, and by area, we’re the second largest—thanks in no small part to the great state of Montana. Our district also includes the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\nEight times per year, the FOMC meets to set the path of monetary policy over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board, including Chairman Bernanke, contribute to these deliberations. (Currently, there are only five governors—two positions are unfilled.) However, the Committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a group of four other presidents that rotates annually. Right now, that last group consists of the presidents from the Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Dallas and Chicago Federal Reserve Banks.\nI’ve said that the FOMC meets (at least) eight times per year. But how do these meetings work? At a typical meeting, there are two so-called go-rounds, in which every president and every governor has the opportunity to speak without interruption. The first of these is referred to as the economics go-round. It is kicked off by a presentation on current economic conditions by Federal Reserve staff economists. Then, the presidents and governors describe their individual views on current economic conditions and their respective outlooks for future economic conditions. The presidents typically start by providing information about their district’s local economic performance. We get that information from our research staffs, but also from our interactions with business and community leaders in industries and towns from across our districts.\nThe chairman speaks at the end of the first go-round. He briefly but thoroughly summarizes the preceding 16 perspectives. I can assure you that this is no easy task—and the chairman’s balanced and thoughtful treatment of our remarks is one of the many reasons that he commands such respect among his colleagues. He then provides his own views on the economy.\nThe Committee next turns to the second go-round, which focuses on policy. Again, the staff begins, with a presentation of policy options. After that, each of the 17 meeting participants has a chance to speak on what each views as the appropriate policy choice. This set of remarks is followed with a summary by the chairman, in which he lays out what he sees as the Committee’s consensus view for future policy. The voting members of the FOMC then cast their votes on this policy statement and thereby set monetary policy for the next six to seven weeks.\nI think that this description of an FOMC meeting highlights how the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government. Representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations. And, as I’ve described, their input relies critically on information received from district residents. In this way, the Federal Reserve System is deliberately designed to give the residents of Main Street a voice in national monetary policy.\nI’ve said that FOMC participants seek to adopt what they view as the appropriate policy choice. That provides a natural segue into my next topic: the policy objectives of the FOMC. The FOMC has a dual mandate, established by Congress: to set monetary policy so as to promote price stability and maximum employment. In my view, the heart of implementing the price stability mandate is to formulate and communicate an objective for inflation. The central bank then fulfills its price stability mandate by making choices over time so as to keep inflation close to that objective.\nOf course, the central bank’s job is complicated by economic shocks that may lower or raise inflationary pressures. The central bank provides additional monetary accommodation—like lower interest rates—in response to the shocks that push down on medium-term inflation. It reduces accommodation in response to the shocks that push up on inflation. By doing so, it works to ensure that inflation stays close to its objective.\nIt is not enough to have an objective—the Federal Reserve must also communicate that objective clearly and credibly. That communication serves to anchor the public’s medium- and long-term inflationary expectations. Put another way, without clear communication of objectives, the public can only guess at the intentions of the FOMC, and inflationary expectations and inflation itself will inevitably end up fluctuating—and perhaps by a lot. It is possible to undo these shifts in expectations, but doing so entails significant economic cost. The nation saw this all too clearly in the early 1980s, when tighter monetary policy necessary to rein in high inflation resulted in painful employment losses.\nThe Federal Reserve communicates its objective for inflation in a number of ways. For example, at quarterly intervals, FOMC meeting participants publicly reveal their forecasts for inflation five years hence, assuming that monetary policy is optimal. Those forecasts usually range between 1.5 percent and 2 percent per year. They are often collectively referred to by saying that the Federal Reserve views inflation as being “mandate-consistent” if it is running at “2 percent or a bit under.”\nCongress has also mandated that the FOMC set monetary policy so as to promote maximum employment. Some see an intrinsic conflict between the FOMC’s price stability mandate and maximum employment mandate. But there is actually a deep sense in which the price stability and maximum employment mandates are intertwined. Imagine that inflation runs at 3 or 4 percent per year for three or four years. The public will then start to doubt the credibility of the Fed’s stated commitment to a 2-percent-or-a-bit-under objective. The public’s medium-term inflationary expectations will consequently begin to rise. As we saw in the latter part of the 1970s, these changes in expectations can serve to reinforce and augment the upward drift in inflation. At that point, the Federal Reserve will have to tighten policy considerably if it wishes to regain control of inflation. But we learned in the early 1980s that the resultant tightening—while necessary—generates large losses in employment. In other words, failing to meet its price stability mandate can also lead the FOMC, over the medium and long term, to substantial failure on its employment mandate.2\nOver the past year, the FOMC has communicated through its statements that it perceives the current unemployment rate to be elevated relative to levels that it views as consistent with its dual mandate. However, an important and ongoing communications challenge for the FOMC is that it is much harder to quantify the maximum employment mandate than the price stability mandate. Changes in minimum wage policy, demography, taxes and regulations, technological productivity, job market efficiency, unemployment insurance benefits, entrepreneurial credit access and social norms all influence what we might consider “maximum employment.” Trying to offset these changes in the economy with monetary policy can lead to a dangerous drift in inflationary expectations and ultimately in inflation itself.\nHow has the FOMC performed relative to its dual mandate over the past three and a half years, since the onset of the Great Recession at the end of 2007? In terms of price stability, the answer is: remarkably well. The personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation rate has averaged 1.8 percent per year from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the second quarter of 2011. In my view, this outcome is essentially consistent with price stability.\nNow, I want to be clear here about what I mean when I say “inflation.” That number I just gave you, 1.8 percent per year for more than three years, refers to what’s termed headline inflation. It includes all goods and services, including food and energy. When the Fed says that it is committed to keeping inflation at 2 percent or a little less, it means prices for all goods and services, including the gas we put in our cars and the food we put on our tables. When we make reference to year-over-year core inflation—that is, inflation without food and energy—it’s only because we believe that core inflation is a helpful predictor of headline inflation over the next three or four years.\nThe FOMC’s admirable performance on the price stability mandate is not due to luck. Since mid-2006, residential land prices in the United States have fallen by over 50 percent.3 Falling land prices were at the heart of the financial crisis from 2007 to 2009 and have generated a persistent fall in wealth and borrowing capacity for households. The associated declines in demand for consumption goods and investment goods pushed downward on prices and inflation.\nConfronted with this enormous shock to the economy, the Federal Reserve followed an unprecedentedly and imaginatively accommodative policy. It kept interest rates near zero. It provided “forward guidance” by explicitly expressing its expectation that interest rates would stay extraordinarily low for an extended period. It bought over $2 trillion of longer-term government securities. Through these actions, the Fed provided an extraordinary amount of monetary stimulus—and so was able to meet its price stability mandate in the face of challenging circumstances.\nUnemployment does remain disturbingly high—over 9 percent. However, I am sure that it would be even higher without the enormous amount of monetary stimulus being provided by the Fed. Moreover, I believe that the FOMC could only have systematically lowered the unemployment rate further by generating inflation rates over a multiyear period that were higher than its communicated objective of 2 percent. Such an outcome could potentially lead the public to lose faith in the credibility of the FOMC’s communicated objective and thereby increase the probability that the FOMC would lose control of inflation. As I discussed earlier, this scenario would require a policy response that would generate substantial losses of employment.\nI want to close my discussion of FOMC performance by explaining why there is no longer an intrinsic connection between the size of the Fed’s balance sheet and inflation. I’ve mentioned how the Federal Reserve has bought over $2 trillion of government securities. It has funded that purchase by tripling the amount of deposits held by banks with the Fed—what are called bank reserves. The standard reasoning is that this kind of reserve creation is inflationary. Banks are only allowed to offer checkable deposits in proportion to their reserves. Economists view checkable deposits as a form of money because, like cash, checkable deposits make many transactions easier. In this sense, bank reserves held with the Fed are essentially licenses for banks to create a certain amount of money. By giving out more licenses, the FOMC is allowing banks to create more money. And if you took any economics in school you learned: more money chasing the same number of goods—voilà, inflation. Indeed, I think I’m pretty safe in saying that after four years in economics grad school, I’ve uttered this phrase—more money chasing the same number of goods creates inflation—more often than anyone else in this room.\nBut this connection between bank reserves and inflation is simply not operative right now. Banks have few good lending opportunities, and so they’re not trying to attract deposits. As a result, they are keeping nearly $1.6 trillion of reserves at the Fed in excess of what they need to back their deposits. In other words, banks have the licenses to create money, but are choosing not to do so.\nI’m confident, though, that at some point in the future, the economy will improve and banks will once again have good lending opportunities. Some observers are concerned that once this happens, the banks’ excess reserves will serve as kindling for an inflationary fire. This concern would have been entirely appropriate three years ago. But in October 2008, Congress granted the Federal Reserve the power to pay interest on bank reserves. Right now, that interest rate is 25 basis points, or 0.25 percent. By raising that rate judiciously, the Fed has the ability to deter banks from using their reserves to create money, and through this mechanism, the Fed can prevent inflation. The Fed’s ability to pay interest on reserves means that the old and familiar link between increased bank reserves and higher inflation has been broken.\nOf course, this requires the Fed to raise the interest rate on reserves in response to changes in economic conditions. You might well ask: Will the Fed raise interest rates in a sufficiently timely and effective manner to keep inflation at 2 percent or a little less? But that’s always been the key question to ask about Fed policy, even when the Fed had a much smaller balance sheet. And that’s my point: Because the Fed can pay interest on reserves, the size of its balance sheet does not, in and of itself, undercut the credibility of its commitment to keep inflation at 2 percent or a bit under. I believe that’s why both survey and market-based measures of expected inflation over the next five to 10 years have remained remarkably stable as the Fed has expanded its liabilities.\nLet me summarize my review of FOMC performance since the beginning of the Great Recession in December 2007. My assessment is that, despite some profound economic shocks, the FOMC—led by Chairman Bernanke—has successfully met its price stability mandate by engaging in imaginative forms of monetary accommodation. These actions have also helped lower the unemployment rate. As part of its accommodative policy, the FOMC has greatly expanded its balance sheet. But it is important to understand that this expansion need not trigger inflation now or in the future, because the Federal Reserve can now pay interest on bank reserves.\nWith all that said, I’ve dissented from the FOMC’s decisions in the past two meetings. As I mentioned earlier, I believe that the FOMC’s ultimate effectiveness relies critically on its communication and the credibility of that communication. I’ve dissented at the last two meetings because I believe that the Committee’s decisions at those meetings diminish that requisite credibility. I’ll close my remarks today by explaining my thinking on this matter.\nThe FOMC’s dual mandate, as I’ve said, is to keep inflation at 2 percent or a bit under and to promote maximum employment—that is, to keep unemployment low. Over the past few years, the Fed has quite appropriately provided a historically unprecedented level of monetary accommodation. However, as inflation rises and unemployment falls, the FOMC should respond by lowering the level of accommodation. This kind of systematic response to changes in economic conditions is an essential part of good monetary policy for at least a couple of reasons. First, there is a great deal of empirical evidence and theoretical support for the idea that following a systematic policy rule, as economists call it, is what enables the Committee to achieve its dual mandate goals. Second, and perhaps more importantly, actions speak louder than words. The Committee can claim that it intends to make monetary policy so as to fulfill its dual mandate. But the public will watch its actions carefully in this regard. If the Committee fails to reduce its immense amount of accommodation in a timely fashion, the public will begin to doubt the Committee’s claims about its goals.\nIn November 2010, the FOMC undertook a second round of purchases of long-term government securities—an action that has become known as QE2. This was a controversial move in some quarters, but I supported it—and I believe that it played a valuable role in reducing what seemed at the time to be a large risk of deflation. Let’s look back at economic conditions at that November 2010 meeting. The unemployment rate was 9.8 percent and was expected to be 9 percent a year later. The year-over-year core PCE inflation rate was less than 1 percent and was expected to rise to 1.3 percent over the course of 2011.\nNow, fast-forward to October 2011. The unemployment rate is 9.1 percent and is expected to be near 8.5 percent by the end of 2012. The year-over-year core PCE inflation rate is 1.6 percent and is expected to stay near that level—or even higher—over the course of the coming year.4 So, since November 2010, the unemployment rate and the outlook for the unemployment rate have improved. Inflation and the outlook for inflation have both risen closer to 2 percent. As I’ve just discussed, in response to these changes in economic conditions, the Committee should have lowered the level of monetary accommodation over the course of the year. Instead, through actions taken at its last two meetings, the Committee has raised the level of monetary accommodation. In this sense, the Committee’s recent actions in 2011 are inconsistent with the evolution of the economic data in 2011.\nI want to be clear about one additional point. Along with many private sector forecasters, the FOMC has overestimated the strength of the recovery over the past two years. Some have suggested that the unexpected slowness of the recovery is a justification for the FOMC’s increasing the level of monetary accommodation over the past couple of months. But I disagree with this argument. I’ve described how, as the economy recovers, the FOMC should respond by reducing the level of monetary accommodation. Logically, it follows that if the economy recovers more slowly than expected, then the FOMC should respond by reducing the level of monetary accommodation more slowly than expected. The FOMC should only increase accommodation if the economy’s performance, relative to the dual mandate, actually worsens over time.\nTo sum up: The Committee’s actions at the last two meetings are inconsistent with a systematic pursuit of its communicated objectives. It follows that these actions diminish the Committee’s credibility and so reduce the effectiveness of future Committee actions and communications. And that’s why I’ve dissented from the Committee’s actions at those meetings.\nThank you very much for your attention, and I look forward to taking your questions.\nEndnotes\n1 I thank Doug Clement, David Fettig, Terry Fitzgerald and Kei-Mu Yi for very helpful comments\n2 The discussion in this paragraph is largely consistent with the following quote from Chairman Bernanke’s response to a reporter’s question in April about the Fed’s ability to lower the rate of unemployment more rapidly: “even purely from an employment perspective—that if inflation were to become unmoored, inflation expectations were to rise significantly, that the cost of that in terms of employment loss in the future, as we had to respond to that, would be quite significant.” (See transcript of Chairman Bernanke’s April 27, 2011, press conference, p. 14).\n3 See Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, LAND-PI (CSW) series.\n4 I’m using current core inflation as a way of measuring medium-term pressures on headline inflation. See May 25, 2011, speech for more details.\n\nNote1\n\nThank you for that generous introduction, John. As Paul Drake described earlier, the board of directors of the Helena Branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is meeting here in Sidney to commemorate John Franklin’s last meeting as a member of that board. I would like to take this opportunity to publicly thank John for his generous service to the Federal Reserve, as well as other members of the board, past and present. It is important for people to realize that the Federal Reserve is represented by dedicated citizens like John and his colleagues on all of the System’s bank and branch boards. In addition, each Federal Reserve bank has a number of advisory councils representing Main Street businesses, agricultural producers, labor groups and community banks and thrifts, among other constituencies. As I will describe later, the input from these citizens plays an important role in the development of monetary policy. So thank you, once again, to John and the rest of the Helena board of directors, as well as others in the audience who have served us so well.\n\nI’d also like to offer congratulations, on behalf of myself and the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, to Thomas Sargent and Christopher Sims, winners of the 2011 Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. In the 1970s, in separate research, Sargent and Sims developed systematic approaches to distinguishing between cause and effect in macroeconomic data. Now, almost 40 years later, their thinking informs the making of macroeconomic policy around the world. I’m especially proud that much of the work recognized by the prize committee was done at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and the University of Minnesota. My predecessors at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis deliberately fostered a research environment that could give rise to such important work, and this tradition continues today.\n\nIn the rest of my remarks today, I’d like to touch on several topics. I’ll begin with a quick description of the structure of the Federal Reserve System and the deliberative process of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed’s policymaking group. Then I’ll describe the FOMC’s objectives and discuss its recent performance with regard to those objectives. I’ll close with a discussion of my dissents on recent FOMC decisions. After that, I’ll be pleased to answer any questions you may have. And before I begin, I should remind you that my comments here today reflect my views alone and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System, including my FOMC colleagues.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts, and by area, we’re the second largest—thanks in no small part to the great state of Montana. Our district also includes the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\n\nEight times per year, the FOMC meets to set the path of monetary policy over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board, including Chairman Bernanke, contribute to these deliberations. (Currently, there are only five governors—two positions are unfilled.) However, the Committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a group of four other presidents that rotates annually. Right now, that last group consists of the presidents from the Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Dallas and Chicago Federal Reserve Banks.\n\nI’ve said that the FOMC meets (at least) eight times per year. But how do these meetings work? At a typical meeting, there are two so-called go-rounds, in which every president and every governor has the opportunity to speak without interruption. The first of these is referred to as the economics go-round. It is kicked off by a presentation on current economic conditions by Federal Reserve staff economists. Then, the presidents and governors describe their individual views on current economic conditions and their respective outlooks for future economic conditions. The presidents typically start by providing information about their district’s local economic performance. We get that information from our research staffs, but also from our interactions with business and community leaders in industries and towns from across our districts.\n\nThe chairman speaks at the end of the first go-round. He briefly but thoroughly summarizes the preceding 16 perspectives. I can assure you that this is no easy task—and the chairman’s balanced and thoughtful treatment of our remarks is one of the many reasons that he commands such respect among his colleagues. He then provides his own views on the economy.\n\nThe Committee next turns to the second go-round, which focuses on policy. Again, the staff begins, with a presentation of policy options. After that, each of the 17 meeting participants has a chance to speak on what each views as the appropriate policy choice. This set of remarks is followed with a summary by the chairman, in which he lays out what he sees as the Committee’s consensus view for future policy. The voting members of the FOMC then cast their votes on this policy statement and thereby set monetary policy for the next six to seven weeks.\n\nI think that this description of an FOMC meeting highlights how the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government. Representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations. And, as I’ve described, their input relies critically on information received from district residents. In this way, the Federal Reserve System is deliberately designed to give the residents of Main Street a voice in national monetary policy.\n\nI’ve said that FOMC participants seek to adopt what they view as the appropriate policy choice. That provides a natural segue into my next topic: the policy objectives of the FOMC. The FOMC has a dual mandate, established by Congress: to set monetary policy so as to promote price stability and maximum employment. In my view, the heart of implementing the price stability mandate is to formulate and communicate an objective for inflation. The central bank then fulfills its price stability mandate by making choices over time so as to keep inflation close to that objective.\n\nOf course, the central bank’s job is complicated by economic shocks that may lower or raise inflationary pressures. The central bank provides additional monetary accommodation—like lower interest rates—in response to the shocks that push down on medium-term inflation. It reduces accommodation in response to the shocks that push up on inflation. By doing so, it works to ensure that inflation stays close to its objective.\n\nIt is not enough to have an objective—the Federal Reserve must also communicate that objective clearly and credibly. That communication serves to anchor the public’s medium- and long-term inflationary expectations. Put another way, without clear communication of objectives, the public can only guess at the intentions of the FOMC, and inflationary expectations and inflation itself will inevitably end up fluctuating—and perhaps by a lot. It is possible to undo these shifts in expectations, but doing so entails significant economic cost. The nation saw this all too clearly in the early 1980s, when tighter monetary policy necessary to rein in high inflation resulted in painful employment losses.\n\nThe Federal Reserve communicates its objective for inflation in a number of ways. For example, at quarterly intervals, FOMC meeting participants publicly reveal their forecasts for inflation five years hence, assuming that monetary policy is optimal. Those forecasts usually range between 1.5 percent and 2 percent per year. They are often collectively referred to by saying that the Federal Reserve views inflation as being “mandate-consistent” if it is running at “2 percent or a bit under.”\n\nCongress has also mandated that the FOMC set monetary policy so as to promote maximum employment. Some see an intrinsic conflict between the FOMC’s price stability mandate and maximum employment mandate. But there is actually a deep sense in which the price stability and maximum employment mandates are intertwined. Imagine that inflation runs at 3 or 4 percent per year for three or four years. The public will then start to doubt the credibility of the Fed’s stated commitment to a 2-percent-or-a-bit-under objective. The public’s medium-term inflationary expectations will consequently begin to rise. As we saw in the latter part of the 1970s, these changes in expectations can serve to reinforce and augment the upward drift in inflation. At that point, the Federal Reserve will have to tighten policy considerably if it wishes to regain control of inflation. But we learned in the early 1980s that the resultant tightening—while necessary—generates large losses in employment. In other words, failing to meet its price stability mandate can also lead the FOMC, over the medium and long term, to substantial failure on its employment mandate.2\n\nOver the past year, the FOMC has communicated through its statements that it perceives the current unemployment rate to be elevated relative to levels that it views as consistent with its dual mandate. However, an important and ongoing communications challenge for the FOMC is that it is much harder to quantify the maximum employment mandate than the price stability mandate. Changes in minimum wage policy, demography, taxes and regulations, technological productivity, job market efficiency, unemployment insurance benefits, entrepreneurial credit access and social norms all influence what we might consider “maximum employment.” Trying to offset these changes in the economy with monetary policy can lead to a dangerous drift in inflationary expectations and ultimately in inflation itself.\n\nHow has the FOMC performed relative to its dual mandate over the past three and a half years, since the onset of the Great Recession at the end of 2007? In terms of price stability, the answer is: remarkably well. The personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation rate has averaged 1.8 percent per year from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the second quarter of 2011. In my view, this outcome is essentially consistent with price stability.\n\nNow, I want to be clear here about what I mean when I say “inflation.” That number I just gave you, 1.8 percent per year for more than three years, refers to what’s termed headline inflation.

However, I am sure that it would be even higher without the enormous amount of monetary stimulus being provided by the Fed. Moreover, I believe that the FOMC could only have systematically lowered the unemployment rate further by generating inflation rates over a multiyear period that were higher than its communicated objective of 2 percent. Such an outcome could potentially lead the public to lose faith in the credibility of the FOMC’s communicated objective and thereby increase the probability that the FOMC would lose control of inflation. As I discussed earlier, this scenario would require a policy response that would generate substantial losses of employment.\n\nI want to close my discussion of FOMC performance by explaining why there is no longer an intrinsic connection between the size of the Fed’s balance sheet and inflation.

As a result, they are keeping nearly $1.6 trillion of reserves at the Fed in excess of what they need to back their deposits. In other words, banks have the licenses to create money, but are choosing not to do so.\n\nI’m confident, though, that at some point in the future, the economy will improve and banks will once again have good lending opportunities. Some observers are concerned that once this happens, the banks’ excess reserves will serve as kindling for an inflationary fire. This concern would have been entirely appropriate three years ago. But in October 2008, Congress granted the Federal Reserve the power to pay interest on bank reserves. Right now, that interest rate is 25 basis points, or 0.25 percent. By raising that rate judiciously, the Fed has the ability to deter banks from using their reserves to create money, and through this mechanism, the Fed can prevent inflation. The Fed’s ability to pay interest on reserves means that the old and familiar link between increased bank reserves and higher inflation has been broken.\n\nOf course, this requires the Fed to raise the interest rate on reserves in response to changes in economic conditions. You might well ask: Will the Fed raise interest rates in a sufficiently timely and effective manner to keep inflation at 2 percent or a little less? But that’s always been the key question to ask about Fed policy, even when the Fed had a much smaller balance sheet. And that’s my point: Because the Fed can pay interest on reserves, the size of its balance sheet does not, in and of itself, undercut the credibility of its commitment to keep inflation at 2 percent or a bit under. I believe that’s why both survey and market-based measures of expected inflation over the next five to 10 years have remained remarkably stable as the Fed has expanded its liabilities.\n\nLet me summarize my review of FOMC performance since the beginning of the Great Recession in December 2007.

Let’s look back at economic conditions at that November 2010 meeting. The unemployment rate was 9.8 percent and was expected to be 9 percent a year later. The year-over-year core PCE inflation rate was less than 1 percent and was expected to rise to 1.3 percent over the course of 2011.\n\nNow, fast-forward to October 2011. The unemployment rate is 9.1 percent and is expected to be near 8.5 percent by the end of 2012. The year-over-year core PCE inflation rate is 1.6 percent and is expected to stay near that level—or even higher—over the course of the coming year.4 So, since November 2010, the unemployment rate and the outlook for the unemployment rate have improved. Inflation and the outlook for inflation have both risen closer to 2 percent. As I’ve just discussed, in response to these changes in economic conditions, the Committee should have lowered the level of monetary accommodation over the course of the year.

Logically, it follows that if the economy recovers more slowly than expected, then the FOMC should respond by reducing the level of monetary accommodation more slowly than expected. The FOMC should only increase accommodation if the economy’s performance, relative to the dual mandate, actually worsens over time.\n\nTo sum up: The Committee’s actions at the last two meetings are inconsistent with a systematic pursuit of its communicated objectives. It follows that these actions diminish the Committee’s credibility and so reduce the effectiveness of future Committee actions and communications. And that’s why I’ve dissented from the Committee’s actions at those meetings.\n\nThank you very much for your attention, and I look forward to taking your questions."

            "content": "Note1\nSargent and Wallace published their classic “Some Unpleasant Monetarist Arithmetic” in the Minneapolis Fed’s Quarterly Review in 1981. Since that date, there has been a growing appreciation of the role of fiscal policy in the determination of the price level. The idea is a simple one. Consider a government that borrows only using non-indexed debt denominated in its own currency. There is an intertemporal government budget constraint that implies that the current real value of government liabilities—including the monetary base—must equal the present value of future real surpluses. Because the liabilities are nominal and non-indexed, the government budget constraint provides a linkage between the public’s assessment of future real tax collections and government spending and the current price level.\nI like John Cochrane’s analogy here.2 He thinks of money and government bonds as being like stock in a company. Just like a firm’s stock, money and bonds implicitly represent claims to the ownership of the government’s stream of surpluses. And just like with financial assets, the variations in their prices are fundamentally linked to variations in the present discounted value of government profits—that is, surpluses.3\nThis simple insight has rather profound consequences for how we think about inflation. Inflation is no longer “always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.” Instead, even apparently independent central banks may not have control of the price level. Thus, if the public begins to think that the fiscal authority is behaving irresponsibly, that belief will push upward on the price level.\nHowever, in the existing literature, the analysis of fiscal effects on the price level is typically based on the presumption that a fiscal authority will never default on liabilities denominated in its own currency. In my remarks today, I will relax this assumption. Once I do so, it will become clear that a sufficiently tough central bank does have the ability to control the price level, regardless of the behavior of the fiscal authority.4 I will argue that its ability to do so hinges on the nature of its response to the possibility of default on the part of the fiscal authority. I will talk about some of the short-run versus long-run tensions involved in that response. Throughout, I will refer to the central bank as CB and the fiscal authority as FA. I will refer to the currency as being dollars, but that should not be viewed as suggesting that I am talking about the United States—or Australia.\nLet me start by describing a simple CB policy: a commodity price peg. Suppose the central bank holds X ounces of gold. It commits to being willing to buy and sell p dollars for each ounce of gold and has a monetary base of $pX. This policy successfully ties the price level to variations in the price of gold, regardless of the behavior of the FA.\nWhat impact does this policy have on the FA? Now, when the FA borrows in dollars, it is essentially borrowing in a real commodity: gold. All of the FA’s debt is essentially indexed to the price of gold, and it is certainly conceivable that various shocks could lead the FA to default on those obligations.5\nOf course, as I have argued elsewhere, this simple policy is generally viewed as suboptimal by macroeconomists.6In contrast, suppose that the CB follows an aggressive Taylor rule when determining the path of the short-term interest rate.7 That policy pins down an inflation path in the usual way, regardless of the FA’s fiscal plans.8 However, given that inflation path, the FA’s nominal debt is now actually real. This means that if the FA is faced with an unexpected decline in its current and expected future real surpluses, it will be forced to default.\nThus, once we allow for the possibility of default by the FA, a sufficiently tough CB can have considerable control over the price level. Of course, I’ve been arguing through examples. It would be more interesting to deliver a fuller characterization of the term “sufficiently tough”—but I’m not going to attempt to do so. Instead, in what follows, I’ll discuss some aspects of the CB’s response to a particularly critical situation.\nSuppose the FA owes $10 billion on a given Friday. It plans to repay that loan by auctioning new debt on the preceding Monday. However, when it auctions off the new debt, it finds that it can only raise $5 billion. The FA is now in danger of defaulting on its Friday obligation of $10 billion.\nIt is at this stage that the level of commitment of the CB to its chosen inflation path will be severely tested. The FA will ask the CB to take some action that will allow the FA to raise an additional $5 billion on Wednesday. There are many possible actions. The FA might ask the CB to intervene by setting a floor on the price of debt in the Wednesday auction. But there are less overt approaches. For example, the CB can commit to a price peg for the FA’s debt in the secondary market for that debt.\nIn any event, if the CB does intervene in some way to ensure the FA’s solvency, the CB no longer can be said to have independent control over the price level. If the CB’s intervention was largely unanticipated by markets, expected inflation will rise after the CB’s intervention. Then, incipient fiscal insolvency has triggered inflationary pressures. Of course, markets may well have already assigned a positive probability to the possibility that the CB might intervene in this kind of scenario. If so, then past inflation was already influenced by the markets’ expectations of this fiscal policy scenario.\nShould the CB be required to never intervene in this sort of insolvency scenario? I’ve argued that a ban on these interventions will give the CB more independence in its control over the price level. For those who think of CB independence as being the foundational element of macroeconomic policy, that pretty much settles the question.\nBut I see a couple of reasons for caution here. It is certainly conceivable that FA insolvency can be triggered by shocks that are well outside the control of the FA itself. And, empirically, FA insolvency is associated with large short-term and even medium-term declines in output. Should the CB be prepared to drive the FA into insolvency given the possible adverse economic impact on the country?\nMore subtly, regardless of the FA’s solvency, sovereign debt issues can fail simply through a coordination failure among investors. If I, as an investor, don’t anticipate that others will buy into the debt issue, I won’t either. In this sense, sovereign debt issues may be susceptible to suboptimal “runs.” The CB can eliminate this possibility by ensuring the nominal promises of the FA whenever the FA is threatened with default.\nThus, I see trade-offs. On the one hand, if the CB is known to be willing to intervene to keep the FA solvent, then inflation is necessarily shaped by fiscal considerations and by the short-run incentives of elected officials. We know from many years of theoretical and empirical research that this effect is not a desirable one. On the other hand, if the CB is fully committed to allow the FA to default if necessary, then even optimal debt management by the FA may end up exposing the country to troubling risks, like sovereign debt runs.\nLet me wrap up. I’ve argued that even if the fiscal authority borrows exclusively in its country’s own currency, the central bank can have a large amount of control over the price level. But the central bank can only achieve that control if it is willing to commit to letting the fiscal authority default. Such a commitment may expose the country to risks of short-term and medium-term output losses. How this trade-off should best be resolved awaits future research. But it may turn out to be optimal for central banks to guarantee fiscal authority debts in some situations. If so, we again have to think of price level determination as something that is done jointly by the fiscal authority and the central bank—just as Sargent and Wallace taught us 30 years ago.\nEndnotes\n1 These remarks are highly similar to those I gave on April 1, 2011, in Philadelphia. I thank Marco Bassetto, V. V. Chari, Ron Feldman, Futoshi Narita and Juan-Pablo Nicolini for their comments. The views I express here today are my own, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See Cochrane (2005).\n3 The present-discounted-value formula for stock price evaluation is based on the assumption that the stock price does not have a bubble component. In the same way, the intertemporal government budget constraint relies on the assumption that the price of neither money nor bonds has a bubble component. This assumption is violated in a wide class of models of money.\n4 See Bassetto (2008) for a related analysis.\n5 As modeled, for example, by Eaton and Gersovitz (1987).\n6 See Kocherlakota (2011).\n7 Here, I’m assuming that the CB is exchanging reserves and FA securities so as to control the path of a short-term nominally risk-free interest rate. This nominally risk-free interest rate may not be the same as the interest rate on FA debt.\n8 Atkeson, Chari and Kehoe (2010) and Cochrane (2011) argue (convincingly to my mind) that an aggressive Taylor rule is not sufficient to determine inflation. The former authors suggest how price level determination can be achieved using a hybrid rule that augments an activist Taylor rule with a commodity price peg. Note though that their implementations implicitly require the CB to have the ability to buy back money from the public. If the CB can only hold assets issued by the FA, then the FA’s actions will influence the value of the CB’s portfolio and thereby influence the CB’s ability to implement a given price level path. In this sense, the CB does not have independent control of the price level.\nReferences\nAtkeson, Andrew, V. V. Chari and Patrick J.

Since that date, there has been a growing appreciation of the role of fiscal policy in the determination of the price level. The idea is a simple one. Consider a government that borrows only using non-indexed debt denominated in its own currency. There is an intertemporal government budget constraint that implies that the current real value of government liabilities—including the monetary base—must equal the present value of future real surpluses. Because the liabilities are nominal and non-indexed, the government budget constraint provides a linkage between the public’s assessment of future real tax collections and government spending and the current price level.\n\nI like John Cochrane’s analogy here.2 He thinks of money and government bonds as being like stock in a company. Just like a firm’s stock, money and bonds implicitly represent claims to the ownership of the government’s stream of surpluses. And just like with financial assets, the variations in their prices are fundamentally linked to variations in the present discounted value of government profits—that is, surpluses.3\n\nThis simple insight has rather profound consequences for how we think about inflation.

            "content": "Good afternoon. Thank you for that kind introduction. It is an honor to be here with you at this important conference.\nPeople often ask me what surprised me during my three years in Washington. One of the pleasant surprises was the quality of the people I worked with at Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board and regional banks, as well as the other financial regulators. It was an extraordinary privilege for me to work with and learn from you, and to call you colleagues. I saw many outstanding people who are dedicated to public service work tirelessly and selflessly to try to stabilize the financial system during a time of national crisis. Those are examples of leadership and service that I will never forget. And now you have honored me again by inviting me to speak at your important conference. I am grateful for and humbled by your generosity. Thank you for this honor.\nFinancial regulators today are extremely busy implementing the many regulatory changes that Congress has specified in Dodd Frank, and trying to close the regulatory gaps exposed by the financial crisis. This conference is important to getting those regulations right—striking the right balance between safety and innovation—but it is also important to continue the analysis and research necessary to fully understand the causes of the most recent crisis so we can reduce the likelihood it is repeated.\nI’d like to share with you my perspectives on the fundamental causes of the crisis, what they mean for regulation going forward and the many questions we still don’t have answers for. I will also discuss some concepts that could be important to protecting against a future extraordinary crisis. Then I look forward to taking your questions.\nOne of the most important lessons I learned in my three years at Treasury is that almost every issue is far more complex than it appears in the public arena. If the answers were easy or obvious, they would already have been implemented. Policymakers are trying to balance a wide range of competing issues and constraints: economic, legal and political. It is almost impossible for thoughtful outside observers to grasp all the nuances and intricacies that policymakers at the Federal Reserve, Treasury or the White House are wrestling with. This now is true for me too, since I am no longer in government. I now tend to give policymakers the benefit of the doubt that you are likely wrestling with important details I am unaware of as you reach your conclusions.\nWhile that is generally true for policymaking, financial regulatory reform issues are especially complex and the risk of unintended consequences is high. It will take time for the markets to fully appreciate the effects of new regulations—likely for months or even years after they are put into effect.\nSetting aside politics, why is regulatory reform so inherently difficult?\nFirst, none of us can predict the future of the financial system any more than people could in the 1930s. As policymakers considered reforms during the Great Depression, no one could have predicted that MBSs, CDOs or SIVs would pose a danger to our financial system—because they didn’t even exist at the time. Consider that Fannie Mae was created during the Depression to help support mortgage finance. Its creators never imagined it would pose a systemic risk 80 years later. In fact, the only thing we know for certain about the next financial crisis is that it won’t look like the most recent crisis.\nWatching airport security procedures change in response to evolving terrorist threats reminds me of the challenges in designing regulations today in response to a recent crisis that we hope will be effective in preventing a future crisis. Has forcing people to take off their shoes as they pass through security caught any more shoe bombers? Has it made air travel safer?\nWe must also confront a second harsh reality that is rooted deep in human psychology: We’ve had periodic financial crises since the beginning of recorded financial history—virtually no country has been spared—and there will be financial crises for the rest of human history.\nPreventing all future crises would only be possible if we were to eliminate innovation in the financial system—which no one wants because it would deprive our citizens of better jobs and a higher standard of living.\nWhen we consider regulation, I believe it is important distinguish between what I will call a “normal” crisis, when an individual institution runs into trouble, which happens about once a decade, and an “extraordinary,” systemwide crisis when the entire system is at risk. I believe the recent crisis was an example of an extraordinary crisis—a one-in-100-year event. Let’s look at its root causes to understand why such exceptional crises are so difficult to prevent: Virtually the entire country believed that homeownership was the American dream and that nationwide, home prices would only go up. The latter assumption permeated the risk models of investors, banks, regulators and the ratings agencies. When that assumption proved false, the results were disastrous.\nBut could we even protect against such mistakes if we could identify them in advance? Imagine if then-Chairman Greenspan had stood up in 2005 and said, “We have a housing bubble. I am going to clamp down on mortgage lending.” How would the country have reacted? Potential first-time homeowners, banks, minority groups, investors and many members of Congress would have been outraged, claiming he was preventing deserving families from achieving the American dream and at the same time restraining our economic growth.\nHow likely is it that any regulator decades from now will be successful in first identifying and then pushing back against a cherished nationwide delusion?\nDespite these shortcomings, we should without question take actions to fix the problems that led to the most recent crisis and try to make sensible reforms that reduce damage from future crises. But we should also recognize that none of us are omniscient and that the changes made today are unlikely to work as expected decades from now.\nThe good news is that the final tool to resolving a future extraordinary crisis is the U.S. Congress. To Congress’ great credit, when policymakers asked for unprecedented TARP authority to prevent a financial collapse, they realized the danger and acted in just two weeks. That action was essential to preventing a collapse that would have brought far more job losses and foreclosures. It is likely the next time we face an extraordinary financial crisis, policymakers at the time will not have the necessary tools and Congress will again have to be part of the solution. Congressional involvement during a time of extreme crisis is appropriate.\nI believe many of the tools created by Dodd Frank can be effective in dealing with an ordinary crisis when an individual institution runs into trouble. Unfortunately, I fear that we still don’t know what to do about a future extraordinary crisis other than putting the balance sheet of the federal government behind the financial system.\nFor example, let’s consider the complexities surrounding resolution authority.\nOur society cherishes certain fundamental beliefs—such as our beliefs in free markets and fairness. If you take a risk, you should get the reward. But if you take a risk and you fail, you should bear the consequences. I certainly share these sentiments.\nIn that sense, resolution authority is very attractive. Regulators can fire the management of a failing firm, restructure its debt, forcing bond holders to take a haircut, and put the firm on sound financial footing—all without exposing taxpayers. Those are all noble objectives.\nI believe such procedures can work—in an ordinary crisis—when a single firm runs into trouble, but the system is otherwise stable. The question is, would it work during an extraordinary crisis when the entire system is at risk of failure?\nI ask myself if we had had resolution authority for investment banks and AIG during the fall of 2008—would we have actually used it?\nI doubt it. Here’s why. In an extraordinary crisis—such as the one we just faced—people don’t know which institutions are healthy and which are weak. If we had resolved, say Citigroup, forcing large losses on its bondholders, how would bondholders of, say, Bank of America reacted? They would likely have been terrified that they were next, and they would likely have sold their debt to protect themselves, and in doing so caused a liquidity run that could have destabilized the institution. Banks have this peculiar weakness that when creditors get nervous and take action to protect themselves, they increase the likelihood that the crisis they fear actually happens.\nThis contagion is the challenge that in my judgment makes extraordinary crises so difficult to deal with. European policymakers are struggling with the risk of contagion today. If Greece is allowed to default, as we at PIMCO believe is necessary, how will creditors of Ireland and Portugal respond? Will those countries be immediately cut off from the financial markets? Where will the contagion dominos stop falling?\nHence, I believe we do not yet know what to do to deal with another truly systemwide crisis, other than to put the balance sheet of the federal government behind the financial system—which is what we did successfully this time. My suggestion is that we continue to work hard closing the regulatory gaps exposed by the crisis, but we should also be humble and honest about what we don’t yet know. Much more research and reflection is needed to learn how to deal with extraordinary crises. Humility can help us to remain focused on these important issues and prevent us from gaining a false sense of security that we have solved all the problems.\nIn my view, our best hope to prevent a future systemic crisis is to institutionalize the lessons from this most recent crisis—lessons that the nation can suffer from a mass delusion and that markets, investors and policymakers can grossly misunderstand risk.\nHowever, developing such a long-term memory, one that spans decades and even generations, is extremely challenging. Much of our society is driven by periodic performance measurements: quarterly reports for public companies, or 2- or 4-year election cycles for politicians. What institutions do we have that can remain vigilant for the next 100 years and raise a warning flag when a future generation is about to repeat our mistake?\nUnfortunately, it is likely society itself will forget the lessons of the most recent crisis, which will then enable the conditions for a future crisis. For example, I find it remarkable that we experienced the unprecedented technology bubble in the late 1990s, and less than 10 years later didn’t identify the housing bubble until it was too late. The bursting of the technology bubble was painful—especially for those speculating on tech stocks. But the recession it triggered was relatively moderate and the lessons clearly short-lived.\nWe often hear that some countries, such as Germany, are vigilant about inflation because their people have suffered from hyperinflation many decades ago, and the pain of those prior generations is still carried by their citizens today. In that sense, the painful lessons of inflation have been institutionalized in German society itself. That institutionalization reduces the likelihood that the policy mistakes that led to hyperinflation will be repeated.\nWhile this most recent crisis inflicted significant pain on millions of Americans and, indeed, continues to, the pain was far less than it would have been had the financial system collapsed, which could have triggered another Great Depression. Stabilizing the financial system was absolutely the right thing to do, but I fear one result is that we’ve now reduced the likelihood that American society will retain these lessons, making it more likely that a future American generation will suffer from a mass delusion that leads to a future crisis.\nIf I am right that society itself won’t retain the lessons, how can we institutionalize them?\nOne would normally look to universities as institutions to retain and pass along knowledge, but I fear that our universities have become too responsive to their customers, their students, to play this role. Business schools today adjust their curriculum to meet student demands. In the late 1990s, they all taught entrepreneurship. After Enron, they all focused on corporate ethics. Now they are all teaching courses on the financial crisis. In 10 years, they will be on to the next hot topic.\nIf neither society itself nor our universities are likely to retain and pass along these lessons, could our political system? Unfortunately, in my judgment, our executive and legislative branches are too consumed by day-to-day political demands to take such a long-term view. It is hard to get politicians to focus past the next election, let alone look ahead decades.\nFor example, President Reagan created the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets (PWG) after the stock market crash of 1987, under the leadership of the Treasury Secretary, and comprising most federal financial regulators. But by the time Secretary Paulson joined Treasury in 2006, just 20 years later, the PWG had already fallen dormant. With Chairman Bernanke’s help, they reenergized the PWG, which became an important coordinating body during the crisis, and it has now been reconstituted as the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which will hopefully remain a vigilant watchdog for the next hundred years. Congress is to be applauded for codifying this coordinating body in legislation and directing it to watch out for emerging threats to financial stability. But politics in Washington can change priorities—especially when markets and the economy appear calm. Note that the biggest regulatory topic in Washington and on Wall Street just before the financial crisis erupted was “capital markets competitiveness”—a fear that our markets were losing out to international competition because they were smothered under too much regulation.\nWhile the FSOC has an important role to play, I believe our best hope for institutionalizing these important lessons lies within the financial regulators themselves, and indeed especially within the Federal Reserve System.\nYou have fought hard over many decades to establish and maintain your independence from day-to-day politics. Indeed, your monetary policy mandate requires you to look across decades and incorporate all that you have learned from past policy successes and failures. Given your large, highly trained staff of research and regulatory personnel, your independence from politics and your significant presence outside of Washington, I believe you have the best shot of maintaining your focus over decades. But it won’t be easy. It would take a focused effort from your senior leadership, who would need to declare this a cross-generational priority for the system.\nWhat are some of the ideas that could help institutionalize these important lessons within the Federal Reserve System? Here are just a few, but I’m sure you can come up with better ones:\nYou have a governing document called “The Purposes and Duties of the Federal Reserve System,” which categorizes your duties into four areas: monetary policy, banking supervision, financial stability and providing financial services such as the payments system. Perhaps these duties could be updated to specifically include retaining and passing forward the lessons of past crises?\nConferences such as this one could be another vehicle. The agenda of this year’s conference is focused on designing and implementing new regulations. Perhaps future conferences could specifically include a session on institutionalizing these lessons?\nDuring the crisis, a friend suggested I read John Kenneth Galbraith’s 1954 book The Great Crash. I didn’t have time to read it until after I left Washington. When I did read it, I couldn’t believe how prescient it seemed—how modern society had repeated many of the same mistakes that led to the Great Depression. I also couldn’t understand why this remarkable book hadn’t been required reading when I attended business school, or even when I joined the Treasury. Perhaps there are a few such timeless pieces that could be required reading for every new financial regulator or policymaker? The challenge is how to prevent that reading list from being updated 20 years from now when someone decides these lessons are just outdated relics of an era long since passed.\nThe goal that I am describing should be to create institutional processes so that 50 or 100 years from now, the next time the entire country deludes itself that we have found a low risk source of easy wealth, someone in authority can stand up and say, “Wait, we have seen this movie before. It doesn’t end well.”\nThis is an aspirational goal and I know it won’t be easy. And, indeed, as I indicated earlier, society may still not listen.\nThank you inviting me to join your important conference and for listening to my ideas. I hope you found them interesting. I am now happy to take your questions and have an active discussion with you.\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you for that kind introduction. It is an honor to be here with you at this important conference.\n\nPeople often ask me what surprised me during my three years in Washington. One of the pleasant surprises was the quality of the people I worked with at Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board and regional banks, as well as the other financial regulators. It was an extraordinary privilege for me to work with and learn from you, and to call you colleagues. I saw many outstanding people who are dedicated to public service work tirelessly and selflessly to try to stabilize the financial system during a time of national crisis. Those are examples of leadership and service that I will never forget. And now you have honored me again by inviting me to speak at your important conference. I am grateful for and humbled by your generosity. Thank you for this honor.\n\nFinancial regulators today are extremely busy implementing the many regulatory changes that Congress has specified in Dodd Frank, and trying to close the regulatory gaps exposed by the financial crisis. This conference is important to getting those regulations right—striking the right balance between safety and innovation—but it is also important to continue the analysis and research necessary to fully understand the causes of the most recent crisis so we can reduce the likelihood it is repeated.\n\nI’d like to share with you my perspectives on the fundamental causes of the crisis, what they mean for regulation going forward and the many questions we still don’t have answers for. I will also discuss some concepts that could be important to protecting against a future extraordinary crisis. Then I look forward to taking your questions.\n\nOne of the most important lessons I learned in my three years at Treasury is that almost every issue is far more complex than it appears in the public arena. If the answers were easy or obvious, they would already have been implemented. Policymakers are trying to balance a wide range of competing issues and constraints: economic, legal and political. It is almost impossible for thoughtful outside observers to grasp all the nuances and intricacies that policymakers at the Federal Reserve, Treasury or the White House are wrestling with. This now is true for me too, since I am no longer in government. I now tend to give policymakers the benefit of the doubt that you are likely wrestling with important details I am unaware of as you reach your conclusions.\n\nWhile that is generally true for policymaking, financial regulatory reform issues are especially complex and the risk of unintended consequences is high. It will take time for the markets to fully appreciate the effects of new regulations—likely for months or even years after they are put into effect.\n\nSetting aside politics, why is regulatory reform so inherently difficult?\n\nFirst, none of us can predict the future of the financial system any more than people could in the 1930s. As policymakers considered reforms during the Great Depression, no one could have predicted that MBSs, CDOs or SIVs would pose a danger to our financial system—because they didn’t even exist at the time. Consider that Fannie Mae was created during the Depression to help support mortgage finance. Its creators never imagined it would pose a systemic risk 80 years later. In fact, the only thing we know for certain about the next financial crisis is that it won’t look like the most recent crisis.\n\nWatching airport security procedures change in response to evolving terrorist threats reminds me of the challenges in designing regulations today in response to a recent crisis that we hope will be effective in preventing a future crisis. Has forcing people to take off their shoes as they pass through security caught any more shoe bombers? Has it made air travel safer?\n\nWe must also confront a second harsh reality that is rooted deep in human psychology: We’ve had periodic financial crises since the beginning of recorded financial history—virtually no country has been spared—and there will be financial crises for the rest of human history.\n\nPreventing all future crises would only be possible if we were to eliminate innovation in the financial system—which no one wants because it would deprive our citizens of better jobs and a higher standard of living.\n\nWhen we consider regulation, I believe it is important distinguish between what I will call a “normal” crisis, when an individual institution runs into trouble, which happens about once a decade, and an “extraordinary,” systemwide crisis when the entire system is at risk. I believe the recent crisis was an example of an extraordinary crisis—a one-in-100-year event. Let’s look at its root causes to understand why such exceptional crises are so difficult to prevent: Virtually the entire country believed that homeownership was the American dream and that nationwide, home prices would only go up. The latter assumption permeated the risk models of investors, banks, regulators and the ratings agencies. When that assumption proved false, the results were disastrous.\n\nBut could we even protect against such mistakes if we could identify them in advance? Imagine if then-Chairman Greenspan had stood up in 2005 and said, “We have a housing bubble. I am going to clamp down on mortgage lending.” How would the country have reacted? Potential first-time homeowners, banks, minority groups, investors and many members of Congress would have been outraged, claiming he was preventing deserving families from achieving the American dream and at the same time restraining our economic growth.\n\nHow likely is it that any regulator decades from now will be successful in first identifying and then pushing back against a cherished nationwide delusion?\n\nDespite these shortcomings, we should without question take actions to fix the problems that led to the most recent crisis and try to make sensible reforms that reduce damage from future crises. But we should also recognize that none of us are omniscient and that the changes made today are unlikely to work as expected decades from now.\n\nThe good news is that the final tool to resolving a future extraordinary crisis is the U.S. Congress. To Congress’ great credit, when policymakers asked for unprecedented TARP authority to prevent a financial collapse, they realized the danger and acted in just two weeks. That action was essential to preventing a collapse that would have brought far more job losses and foreclosures. It is likely the next time we face an extraordinary financial crisis, policymakers at the time will not have the necessary tools and Congress will again have to be part of the solution. Congressional involvement during a time of extreme crisis is appropriate.\n\nI believe many of the tools created by Dodd Frank can be effective in dealing with an ordinary crisis when an individual institution runs into trouble. Unfortunately, I fear that we still don’t know what to do about a future extraordinary crisis other than putting the balance sheet of the federal government behind the financial system.\n\nFor example, let’s consider the complexities surrounding resolution authority.\n\nOur society cherishes certain fundamental beliefs—such as our beliefs in free markets and fairness. If you take a risk, you should get the reward. But if you take a risk and you fail, you should bear the consequences. I certainly share these sentiments.\n\nIn that sense, resolution authority is very attractive. Regulators can fire the management of a failing firm, restructure its debt, forcing bond holders to take a haircut, and put the firm on sound financial footing—all without exposing taxpayers. Those are all noble objectives.\n\nI believe such procedures can work—in an ordinary crisis—when a single firm runs into trouble, but the system is otherwise stable. The question is, would it work during an extraordinary crisis when the entire system is at risk of failure?\n\nI ask myself if we had had resolution authority for investment banks and AIG during the fall of 2008—would we have actually used it?\n\nI doubt it. Here’s why. In an extraordinary crisis—such as the one we just faced—people don’t know which institutions are healthy and which are weak. If we had resolved, say Citigroup, forcing large losses on its bondholders, how would bondholders of, say, Bank of America reacted? They would likely have been terrified that they were next, and they would likely have sold their debt to protect themselves, and in doing so caused a liquidity run that could have destabilized the institution. Banks have this peculiar weakness that when creditors get nervous and take action to protect themselves, they increase the likelihood that the crisis they fear actually happens.\n\nThis contagion is the challenge that in my judgment makes extraordinary crises so difficult to deal with. European policymakers are struggling with the risk of contagion today. If Greece is allowed to default, as we at PIMCO believe is necessary, how will creditors of Ireland and Portugal respond? Will those countries be immediately cut off from the financial markets? Where will the contagion dominos stop falling?\n\nHence, I believe we do not yet know what to do to deal with another truly systemwide crisis, other than to put the balance sheet of the federal government behind the financial system—which is what we did successfully this time. My suggestion is that we continue to work hard closing the regulatory gaps exposed by the crisis, but we should also be humble and honest about what we don’t yet know.

            "content": "Introduction\nGood morning. I am pleased to be here and have a chance to talk with you. My ability to engage in this kind of dialogue reflects the characteristically American design of the Federal Reserve System. Unlike most central banks, the Fed was designed to be a regional organization, so that residents of cities and rural areas from across the country can hear from central bank officials in person and directly add their voices to the monetary policy process. I and my senior management colleagues regularly hear from our boards of directors and advisory councils at both the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank and our Helena branch, and I really appreciate the opportunities I have to get out to Helena and other Ninth District cities and communities.\nOften, at events like this, I provide comments on the economic outlook or monetary policy and then interact with the audience, to get their insights into the issues facing households, businesses, and local governments. I find those opportunities incredibly valuable, both to communicate what the Fed is doing and to hear how our policies, and economic forces generally, are affecting people like you.\nToday, however, I want to forgo my usual monetary policy themes and talk about another way in which the Federal Reserve interacts with citizens at the local level to promote economic prosperity. I have in mind our Community Development program, which collaborates with partners across the Ninth District to enhance the foundations of an open and accessible market economy. More specifically, I want to talk about some important work our Community Development staff are engaged in, much of it here in Montana, to assist tribal leaders who are strengthening the institutions of business law that prevail on Indian reservations. First, however, I must note that the views I present are mine and not those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee.\nCommunity Development\nThe Fed’s Community Development function is not the most prominent of our policy tools, but it provides a useful complement to our better-known tools, such as monetary policy and banking supervision. For example, one of our staff in Helena, Sue Woodrow, helped found the Montana Financial Education Coalition as part of her Community Development work to ensure that low- and moderate-income Montanans would know how to access credit markets prudently and effectively. But that same effort provides a broader benefit to the Fed, because monetary policy is also more effective if consumers and business owners understand concepts like inflation and compound interest. For another example, Sue and her colleagues gathered intelligence last year on the factors that were impeding the flow of credit from banks to small businesses, one of the sectors targeted by our Community Development program. But the results of that exercise were also shared with management in Minneapolis and ultimately with Chairman Bernanke at a national forum in Washington.\nOur Community Development program has roots in the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which requires federal regulators to assess that financial institutions are meeting, safely and soundly, the credit needs of their entire community or market, including credit needs in low- or moderate-income neighborhoods. Out of that basic regulatory responsibility, the Federal Reserve gave the Community Development program the mission of supporting the Fed’s economic growth objectives by working beyond our walls and independently from our bank examiners to promote fair and impartial access to credit and financial services.\nIn pursuing this mission, the Minneapolis Community Development team often works with external partners to shore up the foundations of a well-functioning market economy, including initiatives on financial education like the one I mentioned. This year, they also will work to strengthen organizations that provide training and credit to small businesses, to assist foreclosure and housing counselors, and to support organizations that foster rural development and post-foreclosure neighborhood recovery. In a very local but important way, these efforts supplement the Fed’s other policy tools for promoting economic growth.\nWork in Indian Country\nAs you might imagine, the range of issues our Community Development staff might try to address is vast. I should note, by the way, that we do not operate as a foundation and thus do not provide cash contributions or donations to any organization. Our community development work is primarily conducted through staff work on outreach, technical assistance, and analysis. To thoroughly cover the entire community development field would take significantly more staff than we have. So we have identified some high-priority areas where we think we can make a difference by focusing our efforts. One of our highest Community Development priorities is the one I want to focus on this morning—supporting tribes as they strengthen the legal foundations of their Indian Country economies. By the way, I am using the term Indian Country as a consistent term to describe the many self-governing Native American communities throughout the United States.\nA New Voyage of Discovery\nI find these efforts to strengthen legal foundations of Indian Country economies to be very interesting and full of potential, but thinking about them here also reminds me of their historical roots. A bit over 200 years ago, Lewis and Clark and their Corps of Discovery passed near here on a federally sponsored voyage that launched a powerful transformation of Montana and the American West. That transformation led to tremendous economic development, but, as we know, also relegated most of the region’s tribal societies to reservations. For decades thereafter, the tribes’ affairs were largely administered by federal officials who permitted them very little local autonomy. Partly as a result, economic development lagged on most reservations, leaving them as pockets of sharp rural poverty.\nFederal policy began to shift in the 1930s, with passage of the Indian Reorganization Act, which led to the drafting of numerous tribal government constitutions. But federal policy wavered for another 40 years, including a significant shift away from tribal recognition and sovereign rights in the 1950s. By the 1970s, however, civil rights activism and a shift toward market-oriented economic policies created a consensus in support of greater tribal self-government. A combination of executive orders and the Indian Self-Determination and Educational Assistance Act of 1975 finally put federal support for tribal sovereignty on firmer footing. Despite some unsettled issues, a new realm of meaningful tribal sovereignty within the United States was opened up.\nThis realm remains fairly new and is still incompletely mapped out. I am tempted to say that tribes are now on a new voyage of discovery in search of the most suitable institutions to govern their own affairs, including in the important area of business law and regulation. From an outsider’s perspective, at least, the impetus for this search is simple. In the United States, the bulk of our practical, everyday business law is state, not federal, law. But tribes are sovereign, to varying but significant degrees, with respect to state law. That is, state laws and state legal procedures and institutions often do not apply, or do not clearly apply, to business disputes on reservations. Unless appropriate tribal laws and institutions are in place, the result can be a vacuum, a real or perceived lack of business law and related institutions on reservations. Not surprisingly, this has a chilling effect on business and economic development.\nFortunately, since the 1930s and especially since the 1970s, a number of tribes have pioneered the development of laws and institutions that support growth while respecting tribal traditions. In the Southwest, for example, the Navajo have developed both an extensive body of written law and a strong system of courts to coherently administer a blend of written and Navajo traditional law. Later, I will also discuss work here in Montana. Nonetheless, the voyage has only begun, and much remains to be learned and done.\nOur Work\nThe Minneapolis Fed’s Community Development program is proud to assist in this journey. For many years, we have helped Ninth District tribes explore how to make good use of their renewed sovereign powers, with a special focus on helping tribes develop the legal and institutional foundations of a strong private business sector. This fits neatly into our general strategy of shoring up the foundations of a sound and inclusive market-oriented economy; in fact, I regard it as perhaps the best example of that strategy.\nSome of our work in this area goes back many years, but the thrust of our current efforts took shape early in the previous decade here in Montana. Through the initiative of Sue Woodrow, who is our Helena Branch Community Development staff person and an attorney with experience on Indian reservations, we began to take an active role in national efforts to draft model tribal business laws.\nWhat is a model law? It’s essentially a recommended starting point that a legislative body can use in drafting and passing real laws. For example, states often base their business laws on the model laws developed by a voluntary organization called the Uniform Law Commission.\nAbout 10 years ago, the commission took a new direction by undertaking to draft a model secured transactions law for tribal governments. Secured transactions laws are basic to modern business finance. These laws allow a business owner to pledge movable property, like a truck or machine the business owns, as collateral for a loan. State governments have provided for this bread-and-butter business activity by adopting versions of the commission’s Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) for states and, in particular, its Article 9 on secured transactions.\nAs I’ve noted, however, state law does not automatically extend to transactions on reservations. So unless tribes take similar steps to adopt secured transactions laws, creditors may hold back from making collateralized loans to reservation-based businesses. There are ways to try to work around this problem, and some tribes had adopted varying types of secured transactions laws to fill the gap. Overall, however, big gaps remained, and the existing tribal laws in this area were often incomplete, confusingly divergent, or out of date.\nThe Uniform Law Commission chose to address this problem head on. Under its leadership, a team of business law experts and tribal leaders gathered to devise a model secured transactions law that would both support collateralized lending on reservations and respect key aspects of tribal sovereignty. The team also understood that an effective model tribal act would need to be free-standing, unlike the UCC’s Article 9, which frequently refers to other UCC articles. We were very pleased to make Sue Woodrow available to serve on this team of experts.\nIn 2005, after four years of work, the group put forward a new model Tribal Secured Transactions Act, or model STA, for tribal governments to consider. Just as states decide whether to adopt the Uniform Law Commission’s model acts, tribes are free to make use of the model STA as they wish. However, to help tribes make an informed decision, our Community Development program prominently includes the provision of information about the model STA, which we pursue through our publications, a new Indian Country page on our website, and presentations and meetings all around Indian Country.\nSince 2005, a growing number of tribes have reached the conclusion that the model STA can help them. Again, the way was paved here in Montana. Crow tribal leaders were involved in advising the Uniform Law Commission on the model act and were also quick to undertake the process of adapting the model act to meet their specific needs. The tribe passed its customized version of the model STA in April 2006. Since then, other tribes in the Ninth District and beyond have adopted versions of the model STA, including the Oglala Sioux in South Dakota, the Mille Lacs and Leech Lake Ojibwe in Minnesota, the Ponca in Nebraska, and the Osage in Oklahoma, while others are actively considering it.\nCommunity Development’s support has not ended with adoption of the tribal STAs, and for good reason. The act is important, but achieving its full potential requires a system for filing liens, judges who are trained to understand and enforce it, and lenders who understand and trust it. To assist tribes in putting these elements in place, our Community Development staff have organized training materials and events on the STAs for tribal judges, lenders, attorneys, and other interested parties. They have also helped tribes negotiate with state governments to use existing state lien filing systems. We were thus very pleased when the compact that was negotiated here, for the Crow tribe to use the state of Montana’s lien filing system, was nationally recognized with a ceremonial signing at the Capitol in Washington, D.C., on February 6, 2008.\nRecently, our work in Indian Country has broadened in three new directions that complement our earlier work. First, to assist Indian business owners to articulate and overcome barriers to tribal economic development, the Minneapolis Community Development staff have helped organize Indian business alliances, or IBAs, in Montana, South Dakota, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. These statewide coalitions of tribes, financial institutions, nonprofit organizations, corporations, colleges and universities, and government agencies work to encourage and support Native small business owners and entrepreneurs. Although each alliance is unique, they all have committed to working on four building blocks of sustainable business development in Indian Country: governance, infrastructure, finance, and business training and support resources. The Montana IBA is quite active, and we expect to work with them to host a conference in Montana on tribal economic development issues and opportunities later this year. Similar events with our other IBAs are also in the works this year.\nSecond, we have again made Sue Woodrow available to the Uniform Law Commission, this time to assist in drafting a model tribal probate code. This project is in its early stages but further exemplifies our support for tribes’ efforts to modernize their legal institutions in support of economic development.\nFinally, I have challenged my Community Development staff to evaluate the impact of their efforts to assist tribes in the development of tribal business laws and institutions. Part of their response will be to compare key aspects of the business environment on a number of reservations, in order to assess which factors seem to be associated with better economic outcomes. This is a new and challenging research effort, but I hope we will be able to report some results by next year.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, I have noted that Indian tribes have embarked on a voyage of discovery of their renewed sovereign powers and capacity for local governance. Our Community Development program has strongly supported this journey for many years and will continue to do so. As you can see by visiting our website, our Indian Country work fits into a broader strategy that touches Montana and the rest of the Ninth District in many ways. Nonetheless, I regard our work with tribes who are modernizing the legal and institutional foundations of their reservation economies, much of it done right here in Montana, as the leading example of how our Community Development program rounds out the Federal Reserve’s approach to economic policy and economic development.\nThank you.\n\nGood morning. I am pleased to be here and have a chance to talk with you. My ability to engage in this kind of dialogue reflects the characteristically American design of the Federal Reserve System. Unlike most central banks, the Fed was designed to be a regional organization, so that residents of cities and rural areas from across the country can hear from central bank officials in person and directly add their voices to the monetary policy process. I and my senior management colleagues regularly hear from our boards of directors and advisory councils at both the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank and our Helena branch, and I really appreciate the opportunities I have to get out to Helena and other Ninth District cities and communities.\n\nOften, at events like this, I provide comments on the economic outlook or monetary policy and then interact with the audience, to get their insights into the issues facing households, businesses, and local governments. I find those opportunities incredibly valuable, both to communicate what the Fed is doing and to hear how our policies, and economic forces generally, are affecting people like you.\n\nToday, however, I want to forgo my usual monetary policy themes and talk about another way in which the Federal Reserve interacts with citizens at the local level to promote economic prosperity. I have in mind our Community Development program, which collaborates with partners across the Ninth District to enhance the foundations of an open and accessible market economy. More specifically, I want to talk about some important work our Community Development staff are engaged in, much of it here in Montana, to assist tribal leaders who are strengthening the institutions of business law that prevail on Indian reservations. First, however, I must note that the views I present are mine and not those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Fed’s Community Development function is not the most prominent of our policy tools, but it provides a useful complement to our better-known tools, such as monetary policy and banking supervision. For example, one of our staff in Helena, Sue Woodrow, helped found the Montana Financial Education Coalition as part of her Community Development work to ensure that low- and moderate-income Montanans would know how to access credit markets prudently and effectively. But that same effort provides a broader benefit to the Fed, because monetary policy is also more effective if consumers and business owners understand concepts like inflation and compound interest. For another example, Sue and her colleagues gathered intelligence last year on the factors that were impeding the flow of credit from banks to small businesses, one of the sectors targeted by our Community Development program. But the results of that exercise were also shared with management in Minneapolis and ultimately with Chairman Bernanke at a national forum in Washington.\n\nOur Community Development program has roots in the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which requires federal regulators to assess that financial institutions are meeting, safely and soundly, the credit needs of their entire community or market, including credit needs in low- or moderate-income neighborhoods. Out of that basic regulatory responsibility, the Federal Reserve gave the Community Development program the mission of supporting the Fed’s economic growth objectives by working beyond our walls and independently from our bank examiners to promote fair and impartial access to credit and financial services.\n\nIn pursuing this mission, the Minneapolis Community Development team often works with external partners to shore up the foundations of a well-functioning market economy, including initiatives on financial education like the one I mentioned. This year, they also will work to strengthen organizations that provide training and credit to small businesses, to assist foreclosure and housing counselors, and to support organizations that foster rural development and post-foreclosure neighborhood recovery. In a very local but important way, these efforts supplement the Fed’s other policy tools for promoting economic growth.\n\nAs you might imagine, the range of issues our Community Development staff might try to address is vast. I should note, by the way, that we do not operate as a foundation and thus do not provide cash contributions or donations to any organization. Our community development work is primarily conducted through staff work on outreach, technical assistance, and analysis. To thoroughly cover the entire community development field would take significantly more staff than we have. So we have identified some high-priority areas where we think we can make a difference by focusing our efforts. One of our highest Community Development priorities is the one I want to focus on this morning—supporting tribes as they strengthen the legal foundations of their Indian Country economies. By the way, I am using the term Indian Country as a consistent term to describe the many self-governing Native American communities throughout the United States.\n\nI find these efforts to strengthen legal foundations of Indian Country economies to be very interesting and full of potential, but thinking about them here also reminds me of their historical roots. A bit over 200 years ago, Lewis and Clark and their Corps of Discovery passed near here on a federally sponsored voyage that launched a powerful transformation of Montana and the American West. That transformation led to tremendous economic development, but, as we know, also relegated most of the region’s tribal societies to reservations. For decades thereafter, the tribes’ affairs were largely administered by federal officials who permitted them very little local autonomy. Partly as a result, economic development lagged on most reservations, leaving them as pockets of sharp rural poverty.\n\nFederal policy began to shift in the 1930s, with passage of the Indian Reorganization Act, which led to the drafting of numerous tribal government constitutions. But federal policy wavered for another 40 years, including a significant shift away from tribal recognition and sovereign rights in the 1950s. By the 1970s, however, civil rights activism and a shift toward market-oriented economic policies created a consensus in support of greater tribal self-government. A combination of executive orders and the Indian Self-Determination and Educational Assistance Act of 1975 finally put federal support for tribal sovereignty on firmer footing. Despite some unsettled issues, a new realm of meaningful tribal sovereignty within the United States was opened up.\n\nThis realm remains fairly new and is still incompletely mapped out. I am tempted to say that tribes are now on a new voyage of discovery in search of the most suitable institutions to govern their own affairs, including in the important area of business law and regulation. From an outsider’s perspective, at least, the impetus for this search is simple. In the United States, the bulk of our practical, everyday business law is state, not federal, law. But tribes are sovereign, to varying but significant degrees, with respect to state law. That is, state laws and state legal procedures and institutions often do not apply, or do not clearly apply, to business disputes on reservations. Unless appropriate tribal laws and institutions are in place, the result can be a vacuum, a real or perceived lack of business law and related institutions on reservations. Not surprisingly, this has a chilling effect on business and economic development.\n\nFortunately, since the 1930s and especially since the 1970s, a number of tribes have pioneered the development of laws and institutions that support growth while respecting tribal traditions. In the Southwest, for example, the Navajo have developed both an extensive body of written law and a strong system of courts to coherently administer a blend of written and Navajo traditional law. Later, I will also discuss work here in Montana. Nonetheless, the voyage has only begun, and much remains to be learned and done.\n\nThe Minneapolis Fed’s Community Development program is proud to assist in this journey. For many years, we have helped Ninth District tribes explore how to make good use of their renewed sovereign powers, with a special focus on helping tribes develop the legal and institutional foundations of a strong private business sector. This fits neatly into our general strategy of shoring up the foundations of a sound and inclusive market-oriented economy; in fact, I regard it as perhaps the best example of that strategy.\n\nSome of our work in this area goes back many years, but the thrust of our current efforts took shape early in the previous decade here in Montana. Through the initiative of Sue Woodrow, who is our Helena Branch Community Development staff person and an attorney with experience on Indian reservations, we began to take an active role in national efforts to draft model tribal business laws.\n\nWhat is a model law? It’s essentially a recommended starting point that a legislative body can use in drafting and passing real laws. For example, states often base their business laws on the model laws developed by a voluntary organization called the Uniform Law Commission.\n\nAbout 10 years ago, the commission took a new direction by undertaking to draft a model secured transactions law for tribal governments. Secured transactions laws are basic to modern business finance. These laws allow a business owner to pledge movable property, like a truck or machine the business owns, as collateral for a loan. State governments have provided for this bread-and-butter business activity by adopting versions of the commission’s Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) for states and, in particular, its Article 9 on secured transactions.\n\nAs I’ve noted, however, state law does not automatically extend to transactions on reservations. So unless tribes take similar steps to adopt secured transactions laws, creditors may hold back from making collateralized loans to reservation-based businesses. There are ways to try to work around this problem, and some tribes had adopted varying types of secured transactions laws to fill the gap. Overall, however, big gaps remained, and the existing tribal laws in this area were often incomplete, confusingly divergent, or out of date.\n\nThe Uniform Law Commission chose to address this problem head on. Under its leadership, a team of business law experts and tribal leaders gathered to devise a model secured transactions law that would both support collateralized lending on reservations and respect key aspects of tribal sovereignty. The team also understood that an effective model tribal act would need to be free-standing, unlike the UCC’s Article 9, which frequently refers to other UCC articles. We were very pleased to make Sue Woodrow available to serve on this team of experts.\n\nIn 2005, after four years of work, the group put forward a new model Tribal Secured Transactions Act, or model STA, for tribal governments to consider. Just as states decide whether to adopt the Uniform Law Commission’s model acts, tribes are free to make use of the model STA as they wish. However, to help tribes make an informed decision, our Community Development program prominently includes the provision of information about the model STA, which we pursue through our publications, a new Indian Country page on our website, and presentations and meetings all around Indian Country.\n\nSince 2005, a growing number of tribes have reached the conclusion that the model STA can help them. Again, the way was paved here in Montana. Crow tribal leaders were involved in advising the Uniform Law Commission on the model act and were also quick to undertake the process of adapting the model act to meet their specific needs. The tribe passed its customized version of the model STA in April 2006. Since then, other tribes in the Ninth District and beyond have adopted versions of the model STA, including the Oglala Sioux in South Dakota, the Mille Lacs and Leech Lake Ojibwe in Minnesota, the Ponca in Nebraska, and the Osage in Oklahoma, while others are actively considering it.\n\nCommunity Development’s support has not ended with adoption of the tribal STAs, and for good reason. The act is important, but achieving its full potential requires a system for filing liens, judges who are trained to understand and enforce it, and lenders who understand and trust it. To assist tribes in putting these elements in place, our Community Development staff have organized training materials and events on the STAs for tribal judges, lenders, attorneys, and other interested parties. They have also helped tribes negotiate with state governments to use existing state lien filing systems. We were thus very pleased when the compact that was negotiated here, for the Crow tribe to use the state of Montana’s lien filing system, was nationally recognized with a ceremonial signing at the Capitol in Washington, D.C., on February 6, 2008.\n\nRecently, our work in Indian Country has broadened in three new directions that complement our earlier work.

            "content": "Introduction\nThank you, Jacqui, for that introduction. Good afternoon. I am happy to have the opportunity to welcome you to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and speak with you today. I assumed the role of president at this Reserve Bank long after the launch of the Emerging Markets Homeownership Initiative, but I have heard about your goals, objectives, challenges, and successes from my community development staff. I understand the purpose of this “lunch ‘n’ learn” session today is to encourage dialogue and brainstorming on the next steps for this initiative in light of the recent economic and housing crisis. I thought I would provide some context for the changes in mortgage lending practices that have followed the housing crisis. As always, I am speaking for myself today, and not others in the Federal Reserve System, including the Federal Open Market Committee. I trust that my comments will prove beneficial in your endeavors.\nLet’s turn back the clock for a moment to the second half of 2006. At that time, firms and people around the world held a wide array of financial assets that were ultimately backed by U.S. residential land. (Think, for example, of mortgage-backed securities or any asset backed by mortgage-backed securities.) They viewed those assets as being largely free of risk. Investors may have understood that a fall in the value of U.S. land would impose large losses on them. However, they put low odds on such a decline taking place. Rather, they seemed to believe that U.S. land prices would continue to rise at a steady clip.\nBy the second half of 2007, that belief began to unravel in the face of incoming data. People were beginning to learn the hard way that U.S. land was a risky investment. Now the only question was how risky. The uncertainty about the answer to this question planted the seeds for a global financial panic.\nWhat do I mean by the term “financial panic”? Financial panics are events that blur the line between liquidity and solvency. A firm is solvent if its revenues (in a discounted present value sense) exceed its expenditures. A firm is liquid if it is able to raise enough funds—either by borrowing or by selling assets—to pay its current costs. In a well-functioning financial market, solvent firms are typically liquid, because they are able to borrow against their future profits. In contrast, in a financial panic, lenders feel unable to assess the future profits and/or collateral of borrowers. Borrowing becomes highly constrained, and even highly solvent firms may become illiquid.\nDuring the mid-2000s, many forms of collateral around the world were either implicitly or explicitly backed by U.S. residential land. As I’ve described, beginning in mid-2007, it started to become clear that this asset had more risk than financial markets had originally appreciated. It was not clear, though, how much more risk was involved. As a result, financial markets became increasingly uncertain about how to evaluate assets backed by U.S. land. That uncertainty translated into uncertainty about the ultimate solvency of institutions holding those assets—and the ultimate solvency of any of those institutions’ creditors.\nAs investors became more concerned about the quality of mortgage loans, the secondary market for private-label mortgage-backed securities nearly disappeared. As a result, about 90 percent of mortgages originated over the past two years were guaranteed by government-controlled entities such as Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, the Federal Housing Authority, or the Veterans Administration. Investors are willing to purchase mortgages and mortgage-backed securities from these agencies mainly because they have faith that the federal government stands behind those instruments.\nThis heavy reliance on government guarantees is not a sound long-term strategy. Over time, our country needs a mortgage market that returns to greater reliance on private risk-taking and private risk assessment, along with the enhanced regulatory oversight that is already in place. And, in fact, discussions are currently taking place on suitable options for bringing more private capital back into the mortgage market.\nEven more generally, I believe that as a country, we need to take this opportunity to rethink many aspects of our public policy programs in the context of housing finance. Home ownership has long been part of the American dream, in no little part because home owners have invested not just in their houses but in their communities. But, through the mortgage interest tax deduction and other programs, we are encouraging people to buy homes by taking on debt—and sometimes large amounts of debt. If we truly want to encourage home ownership, we should contemplate programs that provide incentives for individuals to save and become equity holders in their homes—and, by extension, in their communities.\nConclusion\nWe have come through a very difficult recession, caused in no little part by the large fall in residential housing prices that took place after 2006. I believe that the size of this shock meant that this recession was going to be a painful and challenging one, regardless of the policy response. Certainly, the Fed has played, and will continue to play, multiple roles in promoting sound, affordable, and accessible housing finance. In our most prominent role as makers of U.S. monetary policy, the Fed is committed to keeping inflation under control, which helps make traditional mortgages more affordable.\nThe Fed also has a key role in overseeing many of the recent financial reforms aimed at preventing the excessive risk-taking that contributed to soaring home prices, imprudent lending, and ultimately, the housing bust. Our safety and soundness and macro-prudential supervisors will be leaders in applying new regulatory approaches for banks and others.\nFinally, as part of our continuing responsibility for implementing the Community Reinvestment Act, our community development unit plans to work with you to develop understanding, institutions, and programs to promote equal access to credit and financial services. I look forward to hearing the results of your discussion groups today, including concrete suggestions for how the Federal Reserve can help via its policies, programs, and research.\nThank you very much.\n\nThank you, Jacqui, for that introduction.

            "content": "Note1\nSargent and Wallace published their classic “Some Unpleasant Monetarist Arithmetic” in the Minneapolis Fed’s Quarterly Review in 1981. Since that date, there has been a growing appreciation of the role of fiscal policy in the determination of the price level. The idea is a simple one. Consider a government that borrows only using non-indexed debt denominated in its own currency. There is an intertemporal government budget constraint that implies that the current real value of government liabilities — including the monetary base — must equal the present value of future real surpluses. Because the liabilities are nominal and non-indexed, the government budget constraint provides a linkage between the public’s assessment of future real tax collections and government spending and the current price level.\nI like John Cochrane’s analogy here.2 He thinks of money and government bonds as being like stock in a company. Just like a firm’s stock, money and bonds implicitly represent claims to the ownership of the government’s stream of surpluses. And just like with financial assets, the variations in their prices are fundamentally linked to variations in the present discounted value of government profits — that is, surpluses.3\nThis simple insight has rather profound consequences for how we think about inflation. Inflation is no longer “always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon”. Instead, even apparently independent central banks may not have control of the price level. Thus, if the public begins to think that the fiscal authority is behaving irresponsibly, that belief will push upward on the price level.\nHowever, in the existing literature, the analysis of fiscal effects on the price level is typically based on the presumption that a fiscal authority will never default on liabilities denominated in its own currency. In my remarks today, I will relax this assumption. Once I do so, it will become clear that a sufficiently tough central bank does have the ability to control the price level, regardless of the behavior of the fiscal authority. 4 I will argue that its ability to do so hinges on the nature of its response to the possibility of default on the part of the fiscal authority. I will talk about some of the short-run versus long-run tensions involved in that response. Throughout, I will refer to the central bank as CB and the fiscal authority as FA. I will refer to the currency as being dollars, but that should not be viewed as suggesting that I am talking about the United States — or Australia.\nLet me start by describing a simple CB policy: a commodity price peg. Suppose the central bank holds X ounces of gold. It commits to being willing to buy and sell p dollars for each ounce of gold, and has a monetary base of $pX. This policy successfully ties the price level to variations in the price of gold, regardless of the behavior of the FA.\nWhat impact does this policy have on the FA? Now, when the FA borrows in dollars, it is essentially borrowing in a real commodity: gold. All of the FA’s debt is essentially indexed to the price of gold, and it is certainly conceivable that various shocks could lead the FA to default on those obligations.5\nOf course, as I have argued elsewhere, this simple policy is generally viewed as suboptimal by macroeconomists. 6 In contrast, suppose that the CB follows an aggressive Taylor rule when determining the path of the short-term interest rate. 7 That policy pins down an inflation path in the usual way, regardless of the FA’s fiscal plans.8 However, given that inflation path, the FA’s nominal debt is now actually real. This means that if the FA is faced with an unexpected decline in its current and expected future real surpluses, it will be forced to default.9\nThus, once we allow for the possibility of default by the FA, a sufficiently tough CB can have considerable control over the price level. Of course, I’ve been arguing through examples. It would be more interesting to deliver a fuller characterization of the term “sufficiently tough” — but I’m not going to attempt to do so. Instead, in what follows, I’ll discuss some aspects of the CB’s response to a particularly critical situation.\nSuppose the FA owes $10 billion on a given Friday. It plans to repay that loan by auctioning new debt on the preceding Monday. However, when it auctions off the new debt, it finds that it can only raise $5 billion. The FA is now in danger of defaulting on its Friday obligation of $10 billion.\nIt is at this stage that the level of commitment of the CB to its chosen inflation path will be severely tested. The FA will ask the CB to take some action that will allow the FA to raise an additional $5 billion on Wednesday. There are many possible actions. The FA might ask the CB to intervene by setting a floor on the price of debt in the Wednesday auction. But there are less overt approaches. For example, the CB can commit to a price peg for the FA’s debt in the secondary market for that debt.\nIn any event, if the CB does intervene in some way to ensure the FA’s solvency, the CB no longer can be said to have independent control over the price level. If the CB’s intervention was largely unanticipated by markets, expected inflation will rise after the CB’s intervention. Then, incipient fiscal insolvency has triggered inflationary pressures. Of course, markets may well have already assigned a positive probability to the possibility that the CB might intervene in this kind of scenario. If so, then past inflation was already influenced by the markets’ expectations of this fiscal policy scenario.\nShould the CB be required to never intervene in this sort of insolvency scenario? I’ve argued that a ban on these interventions will give the CB more independence in its control over the price level. For those who think of CB independence as being the foundational element of macroeconomic policy, that pretty much settles the question.\nBut I see a couple of reasons for caution here. It is certainly conceivable that FA insolvency can be triggered by shocks that are well outside of the control of the FA itself. And, empirically, FA insolvency is associated with large short-term and even medium-term declines in output. Should the CB be prepared to drive the FA into insolvency given the possible adverse economic impact on the country?\nMore subtly, regardless of the FA’s solvency, sovereign debt issues can fail simply through a co-ordination failure among investors. If I, as an investor, don’t anticipate that others will buy into the debt issue, I won’t either. In this sense, sovereign debt issues may be susceptible to suboptimal “runs”. The CB can eliminate this possibility by ensuring the nominal promises of the FA whenever the FA is threatened with default.\nThus, I see trade-offs. On the one hand, the CB is known to be willing to intervene to keep the FA solvent, then inflation is necessarily shaped by fiscal considerations and by the short-run incentives of elected officials. We know from many years of theoretical and empirical research that this effect is not a desirable one. On the other hand, if the CB is fully committed to allow the FA to default if necessary, then even optimal debt management by the FA may end up exposing the country to troubling risks.\nLet me wrap up. I’ve argued that even if the fiscal authority borrows exclusively in its country’s own currency, the central bank can have a large amount of control over the price level. But the central bank can only achieve that control if it is willing to commit to letting the fiscal authority default. Such a commitment may expose the country to risks of short-term and medium-term output losses. How this trade-off should best be resolved awaits future research. But I suspect that it may be optimal for central banks to guarantee fiscal authority debts in some situations. If so, we again have to think of price level determination as something that is done jointly by the fiscal authority and the central bank — just as Sargent and Wallace taught us 30 years ago.\nEndnotes\n1 I thank Marco Bassetto, Ron Feldman, Futoshi Narita, and Juan-Pablo Nicolini for their comments. The views I express here today are my own, and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n2 See Cochrane (2005).\n3 The present-discounted-value formula for stock price evaluation is based on the assumption that the stock price does not have a bubble component. In the same way, the intertemporal government budget constraint relies on the assumption that the price of neither money nor bonds has a bubble component. This assumption is violated in a wide class of models of money (including any of the so-called deep models of money).\n4 See Bassetto (2008) for a related analysis.\n5 As modeled, for example, by Eaton and Gersovitz (1987).\n6 See Kocherlakota (2011).\n7 Here, I’m assuming that the CB is exchanging reserves and FA securities so as to control the path of a short-term nominally risk-free interest rate. This nominally risk-free interest rate may not be the same as the interest rate on FA debt.\n8 Note that Atkeson, Chari, and Kehoe (2010) and Cochrane (2011) both argue that an aggressive Taylor Rule is not sufficient to determine inflation. The former authors suggest how price level determination can be achieved using a hybrid rule which augments an activist Taylor rule with a commodity price peg.\n9 I’m abstracting from at least one subtlety here. In equilibrium, the real value of the outstanding monetary base must be smaller in every date and state than the present discounted value of the government’s surpluses. (In the commodity peg example, this inequality is ensured by the CB’s holding X units of gold.) In this sense, even abstracting from debt management issues, the CB’s rule can only implement its desired inflation path with sufficient support from the FA.\nReferences\nAtkeson, Andrew, Chari, Varadarajan V. and Patrick J.

Since that date, there has been a growing appreciation of the role of fiscal policy in the determination of the price level. The idea is a simple one. Consider a government that borrows only using non-indexed debt denominated in its own currency. There is an intertemporal government budget constraint that implies that the current real value of government liabilities — including the monetary base — must equal the present value of future real surpluses. Because the liabilities are nominal and non-indexed, the government budget constraint provides a linkage between the public’s assessment of future real tax collections and government spending and the current price level.\n\nI like John Cochrane’s analogy here.2 He thinks of money and government bonds as being like stock in a company. Just like a firm’s stock, money and bonds implicitly represent claims to the ownership of the government’s stream of surpluses. And just like with financial assets, the variations in their prices are fundamentally linked to variations in the present discounted value of government profits — that is, surpluses.3\n\nThis simple insight has rather profound consequences for how we think about inflation. Inflation is no longer “always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon”. Instead, even apparently independent central banks may not have control of the price level. Thus, if the public begins to think that the fiscal authority is behaving irresponsibly, that belief will push upward on the price level.\n\nHowever, in the existing literature, the analysis of fiscal effects on the price level is typically based on the presumption that a fiscal authority will never default on liabilities denominated in its own currency. In my remarks today, I will relax this assumption. Once I do so, it will become clear that a sufficiently tough central bank does have the ability to control the price level, regardless of the behavior of the fiscal authority. 4 I will argue that its ability to do so hinges on the nature of its response to the possibility of default on the part of the fiscal authority. I will talk about some of the short-run versus long-run tensions involved in that response. Throughout, I will refer to the central bank as CB and the fiscal authority as FA. I will refer to the currency as being dollars, but that should not be viewed as suggesting that I am talking about the United States — or Australia.\n\nLet me start by describing a simple CB policy: a commodity price peg. Suppose the central bank holds X ounces of gold. It commits to being willing to buy and sell p dollars for each ounce of gold, and has a monetary base of $pX. This policy successfully ties the price level to variations in the price of gold, regardless of the behavior of the FA.\n\nWhat impact does this policy have on the FA? Now, when the FA borrows in dollars, it is essentially borrowing in a real commodity: gold. All of the FA’s debt is essentially indexed to the price of gold, and it is certainly conceivable that various shocks could lead the FA to default on those obligations.5\n\nOf course, as I have argued elsewhere, this simple policy is generally viewed as suboptimal by macroeconomists. 6 In contrast, suppose that the CB follows an aggressive Taylor rule when determining the path of the short-term interest rate. 7 That policy pins down an inflation path in the usual way, regardless of the FA’s fiscal plans.8 However, given that inflation path, the FA’s nominal debt is now actually real. This means that if the FA is faced with an unexpected decline in its current and expected future real surpluses, it will be forced to default.9\n\nThus, once we allow for the possibility of default by the FA, a sufficiently tough CB can have considerable control over the price level. Of course, I’ve been arguing through examples. It would be more interesting to deliver a fuller characterization of the term “sufficiently tough” — but I’m not going to attempt to do so. Instead, in what follows, I’ll discuss some aspects of the CB’s response to a particularly critical situation.\n\nSuppose the FA owes $10 billion on a given Friday. It plans to repay that loan by auctioning new debt on the preceding Monday. However, when it auctions off the new debt, it finds that it can only raise $5 billion. The FA is now in danger of defaulting on its Friday obligation of $10 billion.\n\nIt is at this stage that the level of commitment of the CB to its chosen inflation path will be severely tested. The FA will ask the CB to take some action that will allow the FA to raise an additional $5 billion on Wednesday. There are many possible actions. The FA might ask the CB to intervene by setting a floor on the price of debt in the Wednesday auction. But there are less overt approaches. For example, the CB can commit to a price peg for the FA’s debt in the secondary market for that debt.\n\nIn any event, if the CB does intervene in some way to ensure the FA’s solvency, the CB no longer can be said to have independent control over the price level. If the CB’s intervention was largely unanticipated by markets, expected inflation will rise after the CB’s intervention. Then, incipient fiscal insolvency has triggered inflationary pressures. Of course, markets may well have already assigned a positive probability to the possibility that the CB might intervene in this kind of scenario. If so, then past inflation was already influenced by the markets’ expectations of this fiscal policy scenario.\n\nShould the CB be required to never intervene in this sort of insolvency scenario? I’ve argued that a ban on these interventions will give the CB more independence in its control over the price level. For those who think of CB independence as being the foundational element of macroeconomic policy, that pretty much settles the question.\n\nBut I see a couple of reasons for caution here. It is certainly conceivable that FA insolvency can be triggered by shocks that are well outside of the control of the FA itself. And, empirically, FA insolvency is associated with large short-term and even medium-term declines in output. Should the CB be prepared to drive the FA into insolvency given the possible adverse economic impact on the country?\n\nMore subtly, regardless of the FA’s solvency, sovereign debt issues can fail simply through a co-ordination failure among investors. If I, as an investor, don’t anticipate that others will buy into the debt issue, I won’t either. In this sense, sovereign debt issues may be susceptible to suboptimal “runs”. The CB can eliminate this possibility by ensuring the nominal promises of the FA whenever the FA is threatened with default.\n\nThus, I see trade-offs. On the one hand, the CB is known to be willing to intervene to keep the FA solvent, then inflation is necessarily shaped by fiscal considerations and by the short-run incentives of elected officials. We know from many years of theoretical and empirical research that this effect is not a desirable one. On the other hand, if the CB is fully committed to allow the FA to default if necessary, then even optimal debt management by the FA may end up exposing the country to troubling risks.\n\nLet me wrap up. I’ve argued that even if the fiscal authority borrows exclusively in its country’s own currency, the central bank can have a large amount of control over the price level. But the central bank can only achieve that control if it is willing to commit to letting the fiscal authority default. Such a commitment may expose the country to risks of short-term and medium-term output losses. How this trade-off should best be resolved awaits future research.

It is a pleasure and an honor to be with you here today and to address this symposium established to commemorate the professional careers and the intellectual interests of Howard and Darrel Alkire, who have meant so much to Hamline University. It is especially an honor to give this talk knowing the prestigious line-up of speakers that precedes me, including Nobel laureate economists and prominent policymakers.\nI became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis last October. During the preceding 22 years, I was a professor of economics at a variety of institutions. I did research in a number of areas, including public finance. My main area of interest, though, was macroeconomics. There has been a lot of conversation over the past year or two about what we have and haven’t learned from macroeconomics. For myself, I believe that one of the most important developments in the field is the use of tools from public finance to answer key macroeconomic policy questions. To my knowledge, this line of research dates back to the work of Robert Lucas and Nancy Stokey in the 1980s. It continues to be a vital area of investigation almost 30 years later—and it will play a key role in my remarks today.\nI’ll begin by discussing current macroeconomic conditions and the Federal Open Market Committee’s recent actions taken in response to those conditions. That discussion will make clear that the committee took those actions because it is not able to cut its interest rate target any further. Motivated by this difficulty, I will pose and answer the following question: What actions can other policymakers take to approximate the impact of an interest rate cut? In addressing this question, I will rely on recent research being done at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis by staff researcher Juan Pablo Nicolini and several co-authors. Throughout, I’ll be speaking on behalf of myself and no other participant in FOMC meetings.\nLet me start with some basic context about how monetary policy gets made in the United States. The Federal Open Market Committee meets eight times per year to determine the path of monetary policy over the next six to seven weeks. The governors of the Federal Reserve Board and the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York are permanent members of the committee. Four other presidents of Reserve banks are on the committee, but this group rotates annually. While they do not vote, the other presidents are invited to the FOMC meeting and contribute to the committee’s deliberations. Right now, I’m a meeting participant, but I will rotate onto the committee in 2011.\nThe foundation of the committee’s discussions is what is called its dual mandate. By statute, the Federal Reserve is required to follow policies that promote effectively the goals of price stability and maximum employment. The former objective of price stability is generally understood as keeping inflation in a range of around 1.5 to 2.5 percent. The second part of the mandate—maximum employment—is more of a moving target, because employment is shaped by many determinants beyond the Fed’s control: demographics, social custom, taxes, technology, and so on.\nWith that context, let me describe the economic situation that confronted the committee at its meeting in November. Over the first three quarters of this year, personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price inflation has averaged roughly 1 percent at an annualized rate. This rate is low relative to the FOMC’s target of 2 percent. More troublingly, the inflation rate is drifting downward. Over the preceding two-year period (from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2009), PCE inflation averaged 1.6 percent per year. Just to be clear, the measure of PCE inflation that I’m describing includes all goods, including food and energy.\nAt the same time, unemployment is high: In October, it was 9.6 percent. Here, too, the trend is not comforting. The recession officially ended in June 2009, and in that month, unemployment was 9.5 percent. Unemployment has actually risen slightly during the course of the recovery.\nSufficient growth in output can steadily lower unemployment. But growth has been low in this recovery compared with most. As I mentioned, the recession officially ended in June 2009 and so has been over for five quarters. Over those five quarters, real gross domestic product (GDP) has grown at an annualized rate of 2.9 percent. More troublingly, growth has been decelerating: In the past two quarters, it has averaged 2.1 percent at an annualized rate. And here, I should note that I’m reporting data on real GDP growth that have actually been revised upward since the November meeting.\nThis is the economic situation that confronted the FOMC in its November meeting. Inflation and employment are both too low, and the rate of improvement in these variables is too slow. Economic growth has been low and has recently decelerated still further. I think it is safe to say that, given this situation, the FOMC would have liked to have been able to cut its target interest rate. But this option is not available. The FOMC’s target interest rate is already essentially at zero (more precisely, in a range between 0 and 25 basis points).\nBut the FOMC does have another policy instrument available: its balance sheet. As of the beginning of this month, the FOMC had a portfolio of roughly $2.3 trillion. Over 2 trillion of those dollars are invested in Treasury securities or government-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government-sponsored enterprises. At its November 3 meeting, the FOMC announced that it plans to buy $600 billion of long-term Treasuries in the open market by mid-2011. In exchange for those securities, it will credit the sellers’ accounts at the Fed with more reserves. This kind of action is known as quantitative easing, or QE.\nThe main goal of QE is to lower the long-run real interest rate. Here, by real interest rate, I’m referring to the interest rate net of expected inflation. More specifically, suppose that the interest rate on a 10-year bond is about 2.5 percent and that people expect inflation to be around 2 percent per year over the next 10 years. Then, the real interest rate is about 0.5 percent per year for the next 10 years.\nA low long-term real interest rate stimulates an economy in a number of ways. It spurs consumer spending by allowing consumers to borrow and refinance more cheaply. It makes capital expenditures and hiring more profitable for corporations. Stock prices and house prices rise because those assets become relatively more attractive as investments. Households with these assets become wealthier and demand more consumption. All of these effects should lead to less unemployment and upward pressure on prices.\nHow does QE go about lowering long-term real interest rates? QE is a sufficiently novel monetary policy tool that different economists may well give different answers to this question. In my view, QE lowers long-term real interest rates in two distinct ways. The first is that QE is a form of nonverbal communication about the FOMC’s future plans. Here’s what I mean. The November FOMC statement says that the committee will keep the fed funds target range exceptionally low for as long as economic conditions warrant. The statement also predicts that exceptionally low fed funds rates are likely to be warranted for an “extended period” of time. In this way, the statement provides explicit communication about the FOMC’s future plans for short-term rates and so also shapes the level of current longer-term interest rates.\nQE provides a significant supplement to this explicit verbal communication. The use of QE indicates that the FOMC is likely to keep its target interest rate lower for an even longer period of time. Indeed, one could readily argue that buying $600 billion of Treasuries is a much more convincing form of communication of the FOMC’s plans than any words could ever be.\nThus, QE lowers long-term real interest rates by signaling the FOMC’s intentions about future short-term rates. However, QE also lowers long-term real interest rates in a second, more direct, way. The holder of a long-term Treasury is exposed to interest rate risk, because the value of that bond fluctuates as interest rates vary. When the Fed buys $600 billion of long-term bonds, the bond portfolio of the private sector is now less exposed to this kind of risk. As a consequence, private investors will demand a lower premium for holding other bonds that are exposed to interest rate risk, and all long-term yields fall.\nIn this way, the change to the asset side of the Fed’s balance sheet provides stimulus to the economy. But what about the liability side of its balance sheet? QE creates more reserves in banks’ accounts with the Fed. The standard intuition is that this kind of reserve creation is inflationary. Banks can only offer checkable deposits in proportion to their reserves. Economists view checkable deposits as a form of money because, like cash, checkable deposits make many transactions easier. In this sense, bank reserves held with the Fed are licenses for banks to create a certain amount of money. By giving out more licenses, the FOMC is allowing banks to create more money. More money chasing the same amount of goods—voila, inflation.\nGiven some of the criticisms of the Fed that have been voiced over the past two weeks, it is important to understand that this basic logic isn’t valid in current circumstances. Banks have nearly $1 trillion of excess reserves. This means that they are not using a lot of their existing licenses to create money. QE gives them $600 billion of new licenses to create money, but I do not see why they would suddenly start to use the new ones if they weren’t using the old ones.\nSome observers have expressed concerns that $1 trillion—which will shortly become over $1.5 trillion—of excess reserves represent what they term “kindling” for some future inflationary fire. I believe that these concerns are misplaced for two reasons. First, the Fed has several tools with which to combat incipient inflationary pressures. Most obviously, it can raise the interest rate on excess reserves as a form of tightening. Second, in recent public statements, Chairman Ben Bernanke has explicitly and firmly committed the FOMC to maintaining low inflation. To use his exact words, he said that he has “rejected any notion that we are going to try to raise inflation to a super-normal level.”\nAs I mentioned before, I do not currently vote on FOMC decisions. I did express support for the FOMC’s decision at the recent meeting. I believe that QE is a move in the right direction. However, as I have discussed on earlier occasions, I also think there are good reasons to suspect that the ultimate effects of any amount of QE are likely to be relatively modest. That’s why I would have greatly preferred for the committee to have been able to cut its target rate rather than using QE. The problem is that its target rate is already essentially at zero, and so it was not possible to cut the target rate any further.\nGiven this constraint on monetary policy, I believe it is important to ask if it is possible to synthesize the effects of a one-year interest rate cut of, say, 100 basis points using fiscal policy tools. In his current and past work, Minneapolis Fed staff researcher Juan Pablo Nicolini and his co-authors have answered this question in the affirmative.2 Their key insight is that there is a broad equivalence between monetary and fiscal policy. They argue that the essence of an FOMC interest rate cut is that it makes current consumption cheaper relative to future consumption. With that in mind, the fiscal authorities can use the time path of consumption taxes to accomplish this same change in relative prices.\nIn the remainder of my remarks, I’ll illustrate this insight by describing one particular fiscal policy plan that is equivalent to a 100-basis-point cut by the Fed. The proposal has three parts. The first part is a permanent consumption tax of 100 basis points, instituted with a one-year delay.3 The second part is a permanent decrease in labor income taxes of 100 basis points, also instituted with a one-year delay. The third part is an investment tax credit undertaken in 2011. The Nicolini et al. results demonstrate that, in a wide class of economic models, the effects of this three-part plan would be equivalent to the effects of a 100-basis-point interest rate cut.\nIt’s useful to explain the underlying mechanism using the kind of example that all Econ I students know and loathe—I mean, love. Suppose widgets cost $1 each in 2011. Suppose, too, that you can earn 1 percent interest over the coming year, but that inflation is also expected to be 1 percent. With that interest rate, and that inflation rate, any dollar that you save from 2011 into 2012 can also buy a widget. So, with each dollar, you face the trade-off of buying a widget today or buying a widget next year.\nNext, let’s understand how an interest rate cut affects this baseline trade-off. Suppose the Fed were able to cut its target interest rate by 100 basis points, without affecting expected inflation all that much. The bank would pass that interest rate cut along, and that means that your bank interest rate would fall from 1 percent to zero. Widgets still cost $1 in 2011, and they still cost $1.01 in 2012. But with the interest rate of zero, you would now have to save $1.01 to be able to buy a widget in 2012. The cut in the interest rate has made buying widgets in 2011 cheaper relative to buying widgets in 2012.\nThus, if the Fed were able to cut its target interest rate, saving would become less attractive and borrowing more attractive. Consumers would demand more widgets today. Firms would hire workers to produce more widgets today. Unemployment would decline.\nBut now let’s go back to the benchmark case without the interest rate cut. Recall that expected inflation is 1 percent and that your bank is paying you an interest rate of 1 percent. In that context, think about the three-pronged fiscal policy change that I described earlier. The first part is that the fiscal authorities institute a 1 percent tax on consumption goods that starts in 2012 and lasts for the foreseeable future. Widgets still cost $1 in 2011. Inflation is 1 percent and the tax is 1 percent, and so widgets cost $1.02 in 2012. Given the interest rate of 1 percent, you must save $1.01 in 2011 to get a widget in 2012. Just as with the interest rate cut, widgets have become 1 percent cheaper today relative to the future.\nThis change in relative prices means that the increase in the consumption tax will stimulate consumption demand in 2011. Why, then, do we need a labor income tax reduction in 2012? The problem is that a consumption tax that begins in 2012 distorts labor supply decisions in a way that interest rate cuts don’t. Consider a worker who makes $20 an hour in 2012 after the various taxes on labor income. If the consumption tax goes up, that worker can buy fewer widgets with each hour of work. Hence, the consumption tax distorts that worker’s decision about how much labor to supply to the market.\nThat’s why we need the second part of the plan, under which the fiscal authorities lower taxes on labor income by one percentage point beginning in 2012. With this tax decrease, the worker makes 1 percent more per hour after taxes. The increase in after-tax wages exactly offsets the decrease in purchasing power generated by the consumption tax, and a worker can again buy 20 widgets with each hour of work. As a result, the new plan makes consumption goods cheaper in 2011, but does not provide any additional distortion to labor supply decisions.\nAt this point, I’ve talked through the first two parts of the proposal—the permanent increase in consumption taxes and the permanent decrease in labor income taxes. Why do we need a third tax change? Unlike an interest rate cut, the consumption tax that begins in 2012 will deter investment in 2011. The third prong of the proposal is that the fiscal authority should correct this problem by offering an appropriately sized temporary investment tax credit in 2011. The key is that the tax credit need only apply in 2011. In 2012 and thereafter, there is no disincentive effect on investment because the consumption tax is constant.\n To summarize, I have described how to construct a three-pronged fiscal policy that is designed to have the same economic effects as a 100-basis-point cut by the Fed. The 1 percent permanent consumption tax that begins in 2012 stimulates consumption demand in 2011. The permanent reduction in labor income taxes ensures that this new consumption tax does not deter labor supply. Finally, the investment tax credit makes sure that the new consumption tax does not deter investment in 2011.\nI’ll make two additional comments about this plan. First, how much would this three-pronged change in taxes cost the American taxpayer? The exact answer to this question would depend on a host of details. But let me offer a very rough calculation. Annual consumption is about $10 trillion, and annual labor income is about $8 trillion. I’ve sketched a plan that involves increasing the tax rate on consumption by 1 percentage point and lowering labor income taxes by 1 percentage point. So, the first two parts of the plan would add about $20 billion per year to government revenue beginning in 2012.\nThe plan also involves an appropriately sized investment tax credit. Private gross investment is about $2 trillion. To offset the effect of the consumption tax in 2012, the fiscal authority needs to provide a 1 percent subsidy to this entire amount. Hence, the investment tax credit involves a one-time cost in 2012 of $20 billion. These calculations, while obviously very rough, do indicate that the plan has the potential to be fiscally responsible.4\nSecond, I’ve not discussed distributional considerations. Raising consumption taxes by 1 percentage point and lowering labor income taxes by 1 percentage point for all Americans would tend to redistribute the burden of taxes toward lower-income citizens. For this reason, I believe that it would be desirable to redesign the labor income tax reduction to make it more progressive.\nI want to be clear that there may be other types of fiscal policy interventions that would be helpful in the current situation. I have deliberately focused on a rather narrow aspect of fiscal policy: How can it be used to mimic monetary policy? I’ve done so for a couple of reasons. First, I’m a monetary policymaker, not a fiscal policymaker. Second, as has become clear over the past three years, the efficacy of many kinds of fiscal policy interventions is still very much an open question among macroeconomists. There is considerably more professional consensus about the effectiveness of monetary policy. In the case of my three-pronged fiscal intervention, it is specifically designed to be effective, as long as monetary accommodation itself would be effective.\nFrom an intellectual point of view, the analysis demonstrates the remarkable power of public finance in addressing important macroeconomic questions. This last lesson is hardly new. Over the past 30 years, macroeconomists have used the tools and methods of public finance to address a host of important questions, ranging from optimal stabilization policy to optimal unemployment insurance. I’m proud to say that a great deal of that work has been done at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.\nThanks for your attention. I’ll be happy to take your questions.\n1 I thank Ron Feldman, Terry Fitzgerald, and Juan Pablo Nicolini for their comments.\n2 See Correia, Isabel, Juan Pablo Nicolini, and Pedro Teles, “Optimal Fiscal and Monetary Policy: Equivalence Results,” Journal of Political Economy 116 (February 2008), pp. 141-70.

In contrast, in late 2008, Robert Hall and Susan Woodward proposed making consumption goods cheaper in 2009 than in future years by eliminating all state sales taxes for one year. They suggested that this reduction could be financed by the federal government. (See http://woodwardhall.wordpress.com/2008/12/).\n4 I’ve focused on a one-year interest rate cut. How can the fiscal authorities mimic the impact of a two-year interest rate cut? The rule is that the yearly interest rate equals the size of the change in the consumption tax rate. In particular, suppose that the fiscal authorities acted in 2010 to implement a 1 percent tax on consumption in 2012, with a subsequent more permanent 2 percent tax that begins in 2013. This path of taxes, combined with the appropriate labor income tax reductions and investment tax credits, functions like a two-year interest rate cut that begins in 2011.\n\nNote1\n\nThank you very much for that generous introduction. It is a pleasure and an honor to be with you here today and to address this symposium established to commemorate the professional careers and the intellectual interests of Howard and Darrel Alkire, who have meant so much to Hamline University. It is especially an honor to give this talk knowing the prestigious line-up of speakers that precedes me, including Nobel laureate economists and prominent policymakers.\n\nI became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis last October. During the preceding 22 years, I was a professor of economics at a variety of institutions. I did research in a number of areas, including public finance. My main area of interest, though, was macroeconomics. There has been a lot of conversation over the past year or two about what we have and haven’t learned from macroeconomics. For myself, I believe that one of the most important developments in the field is the use of tools from public finance to answer key macroeconomic policy questions. To my knowledge, this line of research dates back to the work of Robert Lucas and Nancy Stokey in the 1980s. It continues to be a vital area of investigation almost 30 years later—and it will play a key role in my remarks today.\n\nI’ll begin by discussing current macroeconomic conditions and the Federal Open Market Committee’s recent actions taken in response to those conditions. That discussion will make clear that the committee took those actions because it is not able to cut its interest rate target any further. Motivated by this difficulty, I will pose and answer the following question: What actions can other policymakers take to approximate the impact of an interest rate cut? In addressing this question, I will rely on recent research being done at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis by staff researcher Juan Pablo Nicolini and several co-authors. Throughout, I’ll be speaking on behalf of myself and no other participant in FOMC meetings.\n\nLet me start with some basic context about how monetary policy gets made in the United States. The Federal Open Market Committee meets eight times per year to determine the path of monetary policy over the next six to seven weeks. The governors of the Federal Reserve Board and the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York are permanent members of the committee. Four other presidents of Reserve banks are on the committee, but this group rotates annually. While they do not vote, the other presidents are invited to the FOMC meeting and contribute to the committee’s deliberations. Right now, I’m a meeting participant, but I will rotate onto the committee in 2011.\n\nThe foundation of the committee’s discussions is what is called its dual mandate. By statute, the Federal Reserve is required to follow policies that promote effectively the goals of price stability and maximum employment. The former objective of price stability is generally understood as keeping inflation in a range of around 1.5 to 2.5 percent. The second part of the mandate—maximum employment—is more of a moving target, because employment is shaped by many determinants beyond the Fed’s control: demographics, social custom, taxes, technology, and so on.\n\nWith that context, let me describe the economic situation that confronted the committee at its meeting in November. Over the first three quarters of this year, personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price inflation has averaged roughly 1 percent at an annualized rate. This rate is low relative to the FOMC’s target of 2 percent. More troublingly, the inflation rate is drifting downward. Over the preceding two-year period (from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2009), PCE inflation averaged 1.6 percent per year. Just to be clear, the measure of PCE inflation that I’m describing includes all goods, including food and energy.\n\nAt the same time, unemployment is high: In October, it was 9.6 percent. Here, too, the trend is not comforting. The recession officially ended in June 2009, and in that month, unemployment was 9.5 percent. Unemployment has actually risen slightly during the course of the recovery.\n\nSufficient growth in output can steadily lower unemployment. But growth has been low in this recovery compared with most. As I mentioned, the recession officially ended in June 2009 and so has been over for five quarters. Over those five quarters, real gross domestic product (GDP) has grown at an annualized rate of 2.9 percent. More troublingly, growth has been decelerating: In the past two quarters, it has averaged 2.1 percent at an annualized rate. And here, I should note that I’m reporting data on real GDP growth that have actually been revised upward since the November meeting.\n\nThis is the economic situation that confronted the FOMC in its November meeting. Inflation and employment are both too low, and the rate of improvement in these variables is too slow. Economic growth has been low and has recently decelerated still further. I think it is safe to say that, given this situation, the FOMC would have liked to have been able to cut its target interest rate. But this option is not available. The FOMC’s target interest rate is already essentially at zero (more precisely, in a range between 0 and 25 basis points).\n\nBut the FOMC does have another policy instrument available: its balance sheet. As of the beginning of this month, the FOMC had a portfolio of roughly $2.3 trillion. Over 2 trillion of those dollars are invested in Treasury securities or government-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government-sponsored enterprises. At its November 3 meeting, the FOMC announced that it plans to buy $600 billion of long-term Treasuries in the open market by mid-2011. In exchange for those securities, it will credit the sellers’ accounts at the Fed with more reserves. This kind of action is known as quantitative easing, or QE.\n\nThe main goal of QE is to lower the long-run real interest rate. Here, by real interest rate, I’m referring to the interest rate net of expected inflation. More specifically, suppose that the interest rate on a 10-year bond is about 2.5 percent and that people expect inflation to be around 2 percent per year over the next 10 years. Then, the real interest rate is about 0.5 percent per year for the next 10 years.\n\nA low long-term real interest rate stimulates an economy in a number of ways. It spurs consumer spending by allowing consumers to borrow and refinance more cheaply. It makes capital expenditures and hiring more profitable for corporations. Stock prices and house prices rise because those assets become relatively more attractive as investments. Households with these assets become wealthier and demand more consumption. All of these effects should lead to less unemployment and upward pressure on prices.\n\nHow does QE go about lowering long-term real interest rates? QE is a sufficiently novel monetary policy tool that different economists may well give different answers to this question. In my view, QE lowers long-term real interest rates in two distinct ways. The first is that QE is a form of nonverbal communication about the FOMC’s future plans. Here’s what I mean. The November FOMC statement says that the committee will keep the fed funds target range exceptionally low for as long as economic conditions warrant. The statement also predicts that exceptionally low fed funds rates are likely to be warranted for an “extended period” of time. In this way, the statement provides explicit communication about the FOMC’s future plans for short-term rates and so also shapes the level of current longer-term interest rates.\n\nQE provides a significant supplement to this explicit verbal communication. The use of QE indicates that the FOMC is likely to keep its target interest rate lower for an even longer period of time. Indeed, one could readily argue that buying $600 billion of Treasuries is a much more convincing form of communication of the FOMC’s plans than any words could ever be.\n\nThus, QE lowers long-term real interest rates by signaling the FOMC’s intentions about future short-term rates. However, QE also lowers long-term real interest rates in a second, more direct, way. The holder of a long-term Treasury is exposed to interest rate risk, because the value of that bond fluctuates as interest rates vary. When the Fed buys $600 billion of long-term bonds, the bond portfolio of the private sector is now less exposed to this kind of risk. As a consequence, private investors will demand a lower premium for holding other bonds that are exposed to interest rate risk, and all long-term yields fall.\n\nIn this way, the change to the asset side of the Fed’s balance sheet provides stimulus to the economy. But what about the liability side of its balance sheet? QE creates more reserves in banks’ accounts with the Fed. The standard intuition is that this kind of reserve creation is inflationary. Banks can only offer checkable deposits in proportion to their reserves. Economists view checkable deposits as a form of money because, like cash, checkable deposits make many transactions easier. In this sense, bank reserves held with the Fed are licenses for banks to create a certain amount of money. By giving out more licenses, the FOMC is allowing banks to create more money. More money chasing the same amount of goods—voila, inflation.\n\nGiven some of the criticisms of the Fed that have been voiced over the past two weeks, it is important to understand that this basic logic isn’t valid in current circumstances. Banks have nearly $1 trillion of excess reserves. This means that they are not using a lot of their existing licenses to create money. QE gives them $600 billion of new licenses to create money, but I do not see why they would suddenly start to use the new ones if they weren’t using the old ones.\n\nSome observers have expressed concerns that $1 trillion—which will shortly become over $1.5 trillion—of excess reserves represent what they term “kindling” for some future inflationary fire. I believe that these concerns are misplaced for two reasons. First, the Fed has several tools with which to combat incipient inflationary pressures. Most obviously, it can raise the interest rate on excess reserves as a form of tightening. Second, in recent public statements, Chairman Ben Bernanke has explicitly and firmly committed the FOMC to maintaining low inflation. To use his exact words, he said that he has “rejected any notion that we are going to try to raise inflation to a super-normal level.”\n\nAs I mentioned before, I do not currently vote on FOMC decisions. I did express support for the FOMC’s decision at the recent meeting. I believe that QE is a move in the right direction. However, as I have discussed on earlier occasions, I also think there are good reasons to suspect that the ultimate effects of any amount of QE are likely to be relatively modest. That’s why I would have greatly preferred for the committee to have been able to cut its target rate rather than using QE. The problem is that its target rate is already essentially at zero, and so it was not possible to cut the target rate any further.\n\nGiven this constraint on monetary policy, I believe it is important to ask if it is possible to synthesize the effects of a one-year interest rate cut of, say, 100 basis points using fiscal policy tools. In his current and past work, Minneapolis Fed staff researcher Juan Pablo Nicolini and his co-authors have answered this question in the affirmative.2 Their key insight is that there is a broad equivalence between monetary and fiscal policy. They argue that the essence of an FOMC interest rate cut is that it makes current consumption cheaper relative to future consumption. With that in mind, the fiscal authorities can use the time path of consumption taxes to accomplish this same change in relative prices.\n\nIn the remainder of my remarks, I’ll illustrate this insight by describing one particular fiscal policy plan that is equivalent to a 100-basis-point cut by the Fed. The proposal has three parts. The first part is a permanent consumption tax of 100 basis points, instituted with a one-year delay.3 The second part is a permanent decrease in labor income taxes of 100 basis points, also instituted with a one-year delay. The third part is an investment tax credit undertaken in 2011. The Nicolini et al. results demonstrate that, in a wide class of economic models, the effects of this three-part plan would be equivalent to the effects of a 100-basis-point interest rate cut.\n\nIt’s useful to explain the underlying mechanism using the kind of example that all Econ I students know and loathe—I mean, love. Suppose widgets cost $1 each in 2011. Suppose, too, that you can earn 1 percent interest over the coming year, but that inflation is also expected to be 1 percent. With that interest rate, and that inflation rate, any dollar that you save from 2011 into 2012 can also buy a widget. So, with each dollar, you face the trade-off of buying a widget today or buying a widget next year.\n\nNext, let’s understand how an interest rate cut affects this baseline trade-off. Suppose the Fed were able to cut its target interest rate by 100 basis points, without affecting expected inflation all that much. The bank would pass that interest rate cut along, and that means that your bank interest rate would fall from 1 percent to zero. Widgets still cost $1 in 2011, and they still cost $1.01 in 2012. But with the interest rate of zero, you would now have to save $1.01 to be able to buy a widget in 2012. The cut in the interest rate has made buying widgets in 2011 cheaper relative to buying widgets in 2012.\n\nThus, if the Fed were able to cut its target interest rate, saving would become less attractive and borrowing more attractive. Consumers would demand more widgets today. Firms would hire workers to produce more widgets today. Unemployment would decline.\n\nBut now let’s go back to the benchmark case without the interest rate cut. Recall that expected inflation is 1 percent and that your bank is paying you an interest rate of 1 percent. In that context, think about the three-pronged fiscal policy change that I described earlier. The first part is that the fiscal authorities institute a 1 percent tax on consumption goods that starts in 2012 and lasts for the foreseeable future. Widgets still cost $1 in 2011. Inflation is 1 percent and the tax is 1 percent, and so widgets cost $1.02 in 2012. Given the interest rate of 1 percent, you must save $1.01 in 2011 to get a widget in 2012. Just as with the interest rate cut, widgets have become 1 percent cheaper today relative to the future.\n\nThis change in relative prices means that the increase in the consumption tax will stimulate consumption demand in 2011. Why, then, do we need a labor income tax reduction in 2012? The problem is that a consumption tax that begins in 2012 distorts labor supply decisions in a way that interest rate cuts don’t. Consider a worker who makes $20 an hour in 2012 after the various taxes on labor income. If the consumption tax goes up, that worker can buy fewer widgets with each hour of work. Hence, the consumption tax distorts that worker’s decision about how much labor to supply to the market.\n\nThat’s why we need the second part of the plan, under which the fiscal authorities lower taxes on labor income by one percentage point beginning in 2012. With this tax decrease, the worker makes 1 percent more per hour after taxes. The increase in after-tax wages exactly offsets the decrease in purchasing power generated by the consumption tax, and a worker can again buy 20 widgets with each hour of work. As a result, the new plan makes consumption goods cheaper in 2011, but does not provide any additional distortion to labor supply decisions.\n\nAt this point, I’ve talked through the first two parts of the proposal—the permanent increase in consumption taxes and the permanent decrease in labor income taxes. Why do we need a third tax change? Unlike an interest rate cut, the consumption tax that begins in 2012 will deter investment in 2011. The third prong of the proposal is that the fiscal authority should correct this problem by offering an appropriately sized temporary investment tax credit in 2011. The key is that the tax credit need only apply in 2011. In 2012 and thereafter, there is no disincentive effect on investment because the consumption tax is constant.\n\nTo summarize, I have described how to construct a three-pronged fiscal policy that is designed to have the same economic effects as a 100-basis-point cut by the Fed. The 1 percent permanent consumption tax that begins in 2012 stimulates consumption demand in 2011. The permanent reduction in labor income taxes ensures that this new consumption tax does not deter labor supply. Finally, the investment tax credit makes sure that the new consumption tax does not deter investment in 2011.\n\nI’ll make two additional comments about this plan. First, how much would this three-pronged change in taxes cost the American taxpayer? The exact answer to this question would depend on a host of details. But let me offer a very rough calculation. Annual consumption is about $10 trillion, and annual labor income is about $8 trillion. I’ve sketched a plan that involves increasing the tax rate on consumption by 1 percentage point and lowering labor income taxes by 1 percentage point. So, the first two parts of the plan would add about $20 billion per year to government revenue beginning in 2012.\n\nThe plan also involves an appropriately sized investment tax credit. Private gross investment is about $2 trillion. To offset the effect of the consumption tax in 2012, the fiscal authority needs to provide a 1 percent subsidy to this entire amount. Hence, the investment tax credit involves a one-time cost in 2012 of $20 billion. These calculations, while obviously very rough, do indicate that the plan has the potential to be fiscally responsible.4\n\nSecond, I’ve not discussed distributional considerations. Raising consumption taxes by 1 percentage point and lowering labor income taxes by 1 percentage point for all Americans would tend to redistribute the burden of taxes toward lower-income citizens. For this reason, I believe that it would be desirable to redesign the labor income tax reduction to make it more progressive.\n\nI want to be clear that there may be other types of fiscal policy interventions that would be helpful in the current situation. I have deliberately focused on a rather narrow aspect of fiscal policy: How can it be used to mimic monetary policy? I’ve done so for a couple of reasons. First, I’m a monetary policymaker, not a fiscal policymaker. Second, as has become clear over the past three years, the efficacy of many kinds of fiscal policy interventions is still very much an open question among macroeconomists. There is considerably more professional consensus about the effectiveness of monetary policy. In the case of my three-pronged fiscal intervention, it is specifically designed to be effective, as long as monetary accommodation itself would be effective.\n\nFrom an intellectual point of view, the analysis demonstrates the remarkable power of public finance in addressing important macroeconomic questions. This last lesson is hardly new. Over the past 30 years, macroeconomists have used the tools and methods of public finance to address a host of important questions, ranging from optimal stabilization policy to optimal unemployment insurance. I’m proud to say that a great deal of that work has been done at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.\n\nThanks for your attention. I’ll be happy to take your questions."

Ironically enough, your luncheon speaker tomorrow—Doug Elmendorf—and I lived in the same college dorm back in our freshman year of 1979-80. I’ll leave it to you to decide who has aged better—although I caution you that you’re handicapped by not knowing the relevant initial conditions.\nI became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis last October. During the preceding 22 years, I was a professor of economics at a variety of institutions. I did research in a number of areas, including public finance.

It continues to be a vital area of investigation almost 30 years later—and it will play a key role in my remarks today.\nI’ll begin by discussing current macroeconomic conditions and the Federal Open Market Committee’s recent actions taken in response to those conditions. That discussion will make clear that the committee took those actions because it is not able to cut its interest rate target any further. Motivated by this difficulty, I will pose and answer the following question: What actions can other policymakers take to approximate the impact of an interest rate cut? In addressing this question, I will rely on recent research being done at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis by staff researcher Juan Pablo Nicolini and several co-authors. Throughout, I’ll be speaking on behalf of myself and no other participant in FOMC meetings.\nLet me start with some basic context about how monetary policy gets made in the United States. The Federal Open Market Committee meets eight times per year to determine the path of monetary policy over the next six to seven weeks. The governors of the Federal Reserve Board and the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York are permanent members of the committee. Four other presidents of Reserve banks are on the committee, but this group rotates annually. While they do not vote, the other presidents are invited to the FOMC meeting and contribute to the committee’s deliberations. Right now, I’m a meeting participant, but I will rotate onto the committee in 2011.\nThe foundation of the committee’s discussions is what is called its dual mandate. By statute, the Federal Reserve is required to follow policies that promote effectively the goals of price stability and maximum employment. The former objective of price stability is generally understood as keeping inflation in a range of around 1.5 to 2.5 percent. The second part of the mandate—maximum employment—is more of a moving target, because employment is shaped by many determinants beyond the Fed’s control: demographics, social custom, taxes, technology, and so on.\nOver the first three quarters of this year, personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price inflation has averaged roughly 1 percent at an annualized rate. This rate is low relative to the FOMC’s target of 2 percent. More troublingly, the inflation rate is drifting downward. Over the preceding two-year period (from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2009), PCE inflation averaged 1.6 percent per year.\nAt the same time, unemployment is high: In October, it was 9.6 percent. Here, too, the trend is not comforting. The recession officially ended in June 2009, and in that month, unemployment was 9.5 percent. Unemployment has actually risen slightly during the course of the recovery.\nSufficient growth in output can steadily lower unemployment. But growth has been low in this recovery compared with most. As I mentioned, the recession officially ended in June 2009 and so has been over for five quarters. Over those five quarters, real gross domestic product (GDP) has grown at an annualized rate of under 3 percent. More alarmingly, growth has been decelerating: In the past two quarters, it has averaged less than 2 percent at an annualized rate.\nThis is the economic situation that confronted the FOMC in its November meeting. Inflation and employment are both too low, and the pace of recovery is too slow. Economic growth is low and softening further. I think it is safe to say that, given this situation, the FOMC would have liked to have been able to cut its target interest rate. But this option is not available. The FOMC’s target interest rate is already essentially at zero (more precisely, in a range between 0 and 25 basis points).\nBut the FOMC does have another policy instrument available: its balance sheet. As of the beginning of this month, the FOMC had a portfolio of roughly $2.3 trillion. Over 2 trillion of those dollars are invested in Treasury securities or government-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government-sponsored enterprises. At its November 3 meeting, the FOMC announced that it plans to buy $600 billion of long-term Treasuries in the open market by mid-2011.

To use his exact words, he said that he has “rejected any notion that we are going to try to raise inflation to a super-normal level.”\nAs I mentioned before, I do not currently vote on FOMC decisions. I did express support for the FOMC’s decision at the recent meeting. I believe that QE is a move in the right direction. However, as I have discussed on earlier occasions, I also think there are good reasons to suspect that the ultimate effects of any amount of QE are likely to be relatively modest. That’s why I would have greatly preferred for the committee to have been able to cut its target rate rather than using QE. The problem is that its target rate is already essentially at zero, and so it was not possible to cut the target rate any further.\nGiven this constraint on monetary policy, I believe it is important to ask if it is possible to synthesize the effects of a one-year interest rate cut of, say, 100 basis points using fiscal policy tools. In his current and past work, Minneapolis Fed staff researcher Juan Pablo Nicolini and his co-authors have answered this question in the affirmative.2 Their key insight is that there is a broad equivalence between monetary and fiscal policy. They argue that the essence of an FOMC interest rate cut is that it makes current consumption cheaper relative to future consumption. With that in mind, the fiscal authorities can use the time path of consumption taxes to accomplish this same change in relative prices.\nIn the remainder of my remarks, I’ll illustrate this insight by describing one particular fiscal policy plan that is equivalent to a 100-basis-point cut by the Fed. The proposal has three parts. The first part is a permanent consumption tax of 100 basis points, instituted with a one-year delay.3 The second part is a permanent decrease in labor income taxes of 100 basis points, also instituted with a one-year delay. The third part is an investment tax credit undertaken in 2011. The Nicolini et al. results demonstrate that, in a wide class of economic models, the effects of this three-part plan would be equivalent to the effects of a 100-basis-point interest rate cut.\nIt’s useful to explain the underlying mechanism using the kind of example that all Econ I students have grown to love. Suppose widgets cost $1 each in 2011. Suppose, too, that you can earn 1 percent interest over the coming year, but that inflation is also expected to be 1 percent. With that interest rate, and that inflation rate, any dollar that you save from 2011 into 2012 can also buy a widget. So, with each dollar, you face the trade-off of buying a widget today or buying a widget next year.\nNext, let’s understand how an interest rate cut affects this baseline trade-off. Suppose the Fed were able to cut its target interest rate by 100 basis points, without affecting expected inflation all that much. The bank would pass that interest rate cut along, and that means that your bank interest rate would fall from 1 percent to zero. Widgets still cost $1 in 2011, and they still cost $1.01 in 2012. But with the interest rate of zero, you would now have to save $1.01 to be able to buy a widget in 2012. The cut in the interest rate has made buying widgets in 2011 cheaper relative to buying widgets in 2012.\nThus, if the Fed were able to cut its target interest rate, saving would become less attractive and borrowing more attractive. Consumers would demand more widgets today. Firms would hire workers to produce more widgets today. Unemployment would decline.\nBut now let’s go back to the benchmark case without the interest rate cut. Recall that expected inflation is 1 percent and that your bank is paying you an interest rate of 1 percent. In that context, think about the three-pronged fiscal policy change that I described earlier. The first part is that the fiscal authorities institute a 1 percent tax on consumption goods that starts in 2012 and lasts for the foreseeable future. Widgets still cost $1 in 2011. Inflation is 1 percent and the tax is 1 percent, and so widgets cost $1.02 in 2012. Given the interest rate of 1 percent, you must save $1.01 in 2011 to get a widget in 2012. Just as with the interest rate cut, widgets have become 1 percent cheaper today relative to the future.\nThis change in relative prices means that the increase in the consumption tax will stimulate consumption demand in 2011. Why, then, do we need a labor income tax reduction in 2012? The problem is that a consumption tax that begins in 2012 distorts labor supply decisions in a way that interest rate cuts don’t. Consider a worker who makes $20 an hour in 2012 after the various taxes on labor income. If the consumption tax goes up, that worker can buy fewer widgets with each hour of work. Hence, the consumption tax distorts that worker’s decision about how much labor to supply to the market.\nThat’s why we need the second part of the plan, under which the fiscal authorities lower taxes on labor income by one percentage point beginning in 2012. With this tax decrease, the worker makes 1 percent more per hour after taxes. The increase in after-tax wages exactly offsets the decrease in purchasing power generated by the consumption tax, and a worker can again buy 20 widgets with each hour of work. As a result, the new plan makes consumption goods cheaper in 2011, but does not provide any additional distortion to labor supply decisions.\nAt this point, I’ve talked through the first two parts of the proposal—the permanent increase in consumption taxes and the permanent decrease in labor income taxes. Why do we need a third tax change? Unlike an interest rate cut, the consumption tax that begins in 2012 will deter investment in 2011. The third prong of the proposal is that the fiscal authority should correct this problem by offering an appropriately sized temporary investment tax credit in 2011. The key is that the tax credit need only apply in 2011. In 2012 and thereafter, there is no disincentive effect on investment because the consumption tax is constant.\n To summarize, I have described how to construct a three-pronged fiscal policy that is designed to have the same economic effects as a 100-basis-point cut by the Fed. The 1 percent permanent consumption tax that begins in 2012 stimulates consumption demand in 2011. The permanent reduction in labor income taxes ensures that this new consumption tax does not deter labor supply. Finally, the investment tax credit makes sure that the new consumption tax does not deter investment in 2011.\nI’ll make two additional comments about this plan. First, how much would this three-pronged change in taxes cost the American taxpayer? The exact answer to this question would depend on a host of details—details that many of you know a lot more about than I do. But let me offer a very rough calculation. Annual consumption is about $10 trillion, and annual labor income is about $8 trillion. I’ve sketched a plan that involves increasing the tax rate on consumption by 1 percentage point and lowering labor income taxes by 1 percentage point. So, the first two parts of the plan would add about $20 billion per year to government revenue beginning in 2012.\nThe plan also involves an appropriately sized investment tax credit. Private gross investment is about $2 trillion. To offset the effect of the consumption tax in 2012, the fiscal authority needs to provide a 1 percent subsidy to this entire amount. Hence, the investment tax credit involves a one-time cost in 2012 of $20 billion. These calculations, while obviously very rough, do indicate that the plan has the potential to be fiscally responsible.4\nSecond, I’ve not discussed distributional considerations. Raising consumption taxes by 1 percentage point and lowering labor income taxes by 1 percentage point for all Americans would tend to redistribute the burden of taxes toward lower-income citizens. For this reason, I believe that it would be desirable to redesign the labor income tax reduction to make it more progressive.\nOverall, I believe that this analysis has both policy and intellectual aspects. From a policy point of view, I’ve deliberately focused on a rather narrow aspect of fiscal policy—namely, how it can be used to mimic monetary policy. That narrow focus seems appropriate to me, given my role in the policy process. I find the resultant policy to be attractive because may be able to generate macroeconomic stimulus without increasing the deficit.\nFrom an intellectual point of view, the analysis demonstrates the remarkable power of public finance in addressing important macroeconomic questions. Of course, this last lesson is hardly new. As I mentioned at the beginning of my talk, over the past 30 years, macroeconomists have used the tools and methods of public finance to address a host of important questions, ranging from optimal stabilization policy to optimal unemployment insurance. I’m proud to say that a great deal of that work has been done at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.\nThanks for your attention. I’ll be happy to take your questions.\n1 I thank Ron Feldman, Terry Fitzgerald, and Juan Pablo Nicolini for their comments.\n2 See Correia, Isabel, Juan Pablo Nicolini, and Pedro Teles, “Optimal Fiscal and Monetary Policy: Equivalence Results,” Journal of Political Economy 116 (February 2008), pp. 141-70. (Also available online at minneapolisfed.org.) See also Correia, Isabel, Emmanuel Farhi, Juan Pablo Nicolini, and Pedro Teles, “Policy at the Zero Bound,” working paper (October 2010).\n3 My scheme makes current consumption cheaper by imposing a permanent tax on future consumption. In contrast, in late 2008, Robert Hall and Susan Woodward proposed making consumption goods cheaper in 2009 than in future years by eliminating all state sales taxes for one year. They suggested that this reduction could be financed by the federal government. (See http://woodwardhall.wordpress.com/2008/12/).\n4 I’ve focused on a one-year interest rate cut. How can the fiscal authorities mimic the impact of a two-year interest rate cut? The rule is that the yearly interest rate equals the size of the change in the consumption tax rate. In particular, suppose that the fiscal authorities acted in 2010 to implement a 1 percent tax on consumption in 2012, with a subsequent more permanent 2 percent tax that begins in 2013. This path of taxes, combined with the appropriate labor income tax reductions and investment tax credits, functions like a two-year interest rate cut that begins in 2011.\n\nNote1\n\nThank you for that generous introduction, Harvey. It’s a huge honor for me to be addressing you, and I certainly want to thank Wojciech and Karl for inviting me. Ironically enough, your luncheon speaker tomorrow—Doug Elmendorf—and I lived in the same college dorm back in our freshman year of 1979-80. I’ll leave it to you to decide who has aged better—although I caution you that you’re handicapped by not knowing the relevant initial conditions.\n\nI became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis last October. During the preceding 22 years, I was a professor of economics at a variety of institutions. I did research in a number of areas, including public finance. My main area of interest, though, was macroeconomics.\n\nThere has been a lot of conversation over the past year or two about what we have and haven’t learned from macroeconomics. For myself, I believe that one of the most important developments in the field is the use of tools from theoretical public finance to answer key policy questions. To my knowledge, this line of research dates back to the work of Robert Lucas and Nancy Stokey in the 1980s, although I’m sure that some of you might be able to point to even earlier sources. It continues to be a vital area of investigation almost 30 years later—and it will play a key role in my remarks today.\n\nI’ll begin by discussing current macroeconomic conditions and the Federal Open Market Committee’s recent actions taken in response to those conditions. That discussion will make clear that the committee took those actions because it is not able to cut its interest rate target any further. Motivated by this difficulty, I will pose and answer the following question: What actions can other policymakers take to approximate the impact of an interest rate cut? In addressing this question, I will rely on recent research being done at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis by staff researcher Juan Pablo Nicolini and several co-authors. Throughout, I’ll be speaking on behalf of myself and no other participant in FOMC meetings.\n\nLet me start with some basic context about how monetary policy gets made in the United States. The Federal Open Market Committee meets eight times per year to determine the path of monetary policy over the next six to seven weeks. The governors of the Federal Reserve Board and the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York are permanent members of the committee. Four other presidents of Reserve banks are on the committee, but this group rotates annually. While they do not vote, the other presidents are invited to the FOMC meeting and contribute to the committee’s deliberations. Right now, I’m a meeting participant, but I will rotate onto the committee in 2011.\n\nThe foundation of the committee’s discussions is what is called its dual mandate. By statute, the Federal Reserve is required to follow policies that promote effectively the goals of price stability and maximum employment. The former objective of price stability is generally understood as keeping inflation in a range of around 1.5 to 2.5 percent. The second part of the mandate—maximum employment—is more of a moving target, because employment is shaped by many determinants beyond the Fed’s control: demographics, social custom, taxes, technology, and so on.\n\nOver the first three quarters of this year, personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price inflation has averaged roughly 1 percent at an annualized rate. This rate is low relative to the FOMC’s target of 2 percent. More troublingly, the inflation rate is drifting downward. Over the preceding two-year period (from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2009), PCE inflation averaged 1.6 percent per year.\n\nAt the same time, unemployment is high: In October, it was 9.6 percent. Here, too, the trend is not comforting. The recession officially ended in June 2009, and in that month, unemployment was 9.5 percent. Unemployment has actually risen slightly during the course of the recovery.\n\nSufficient growth in output can steadily lower unemployment. But growth has been low in this recovery compared with most. As I mentioned, the recession officially ended in June 2009 and so has been over for five quarters. Over those five quarters, real gross domestic product (GDP) has grown at an annualized rate of under 3 percent. More alarmingly, growth has been decelerating: In the past two quarters, it has averaged less than 2 percent at an annualized rate.\n\nThis is the economic situation that confronted the FOMC in its November meeting. Inflation and employment are both too low, and the pace of recovery is too slow. Economic growth is low and softening further. I think it is safe to say that, given this situation, the FOMC would have liked to have been able to cut its target interest rate. But this option is not available. The FOMC’s target interest rate is already essentially at zero (more precisely, in a range between 0 and 25 basis points).\n\nBut the FOMC does have another policy instrument available: its balance sheet. As of the beginning of this month, the FOMC had a portfolio of roughly $2.3 trillion. Over 2 trillion of those dollars are invested in Treasury securities or government-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government-sponsored enterprises. At its November 3 meeting, the FOMC announced that it plans to buy $600 billion of long-term Treasuries in the open market by mid-2011. In exchange for those securities, it will credit the sellers’ accounts at the Fed with more reserves. This kind of action is known as quantitative easing, or QE.\n\nThe main goal of QE is to lower the long-run real interest rate. As you all know, by real interest rate, I’m referring to the interest rate net of expected inflation. More specifically, suppose that the interest rate on a 10-year bond is about 2.5 percent and that people expect inflation to be around 2 percent per year over the next 10 years. Then, the real interest rate is about 0.5 percent per year for the next 10 years.\n\nA low long-term real interest rate stimulates an economy in a number of ways. It spurs consumer spending by allowing consumers to borrow and refinance more cheaply. It makes capital expenditures and hiring more profitable for corporations. Stock prices and house prices rise because those assets become relatively more attractive as investments. Households with these assets become wealthier and demand more consumption. All of these effects should lead to less unemployment and upward pressure on prices.\n\nHow does QE go about lowering long-term real interest rates? QE is a sufficiently novel monetary policy tool that different economists may well give different answers to this question. In my view, QE lowers long-term real interest rates in two distinct ways. The first is that QE is a form of nonverbal communication about the FOMC’s future plans. Here’s what I mean. The November FOMC statement says that the committee will keep the fed funds target range exceptionally low for as long as economic conditions warrant. The statement also predicts that exceptionally low fed funds rates are likely to be warranted for an “extended period” of time. In this way, the statement provides explicit communication about the FOMC’s future plans for short-term rates and so also shapes the level of current longer-term interest rates.\n\nQE provides a significant supplement to this explicit verbal communication. The use of QE indicates that the FOMC is likely to keep its target interest rate lower for an even longer period of time. Indeed, one could readily argue that buying $600 billion of Treasuries is a much more convincing form of communication of the FOMC’s plans than any words could ever be.\n\nThus, QE lowers long-term real interest rates by signaling the FOMC’s intentions about future short-term rates. However, QE also lowers long-term real interest rates in a second, more direct, way. The holder of a long-term Treasury is exposed to interest rate risk, because the value of that bond fluctuates as interest rates vary. When the Fed buys $600 billion of long-term bonds, the bond portfolio of the private sector is now less exposed to this kind of risk. As a consequence, private investors will demand a lower premium for holding other bonds that are exposed to interest rate risk, and all long-term yields fall.\n\nIn this way, the change to the asset side of the Fed’s balance sheet provides stimulus to the economy. But what about the liability side of its balance sheet? QE creates more reserves in banks’ accounts with the Fed. The standard intuition is that this kind of reserve creation is inflationary. Banks can only offer checkable deposits in proportion to their reserves. Economists view checkable deposits as a form of money because, like cash, checkable deposits make many transactions easier. In this sense, bank reserves held with the Fed are licenses for banks to create a certain amount of money. By giving out more licenses, the FOMC is allowing banks to create more money. More money chasing the same amount of goods—voila, inflation.\n\nGiven some of the criticisms of the Fed that have been voiced over the past two weeks, it is important to understand that this basic logic isn’t valid in current circumstances. Banks have nearly $1 trillion of excess reserves. This means that they are not using a lot of their existing licenses to create money. QE gives them $600 billion of new licenses to create money, but I do not see why they would suddenly start to use the new ones if they weren’t using the old ones.\n\nSome observers have expressed concerns that $1 trillion—which will shortly become over $1.5 trillion—of excess reserves represent what they term “kindling” for some future inflationary fire. I believe that these concerns are misplaced for two reasons. First, the Fed has several tools with which to combat incipient inflationary pressures. Most obviously, it can raise the interest rate on excess reserves as a form of tightening. Second, in recent public statements, Chairman Ben Bernanke has explicitly and firmly committed the FOMC to maintaining low inflation. To use his exact words, he said that he has “rejected any notion that we are going to try to raise inflation to a super-normal level.”\n\nAs I mentioned before, I do not currently vote on FOMC decisions. I did express support for the FOMC’s decision at the recent meeting. I believe that QE is a move in the right direction. However, as I have discussed on earlier occasions, I also think there are good reasons to suspect that the ultimate effects of any amount of QE are likely to be relatively modest. That’s why I would have greatly preferred for the committee to have been able to cut its target rate rather than using QE. The problem is that its target rate is already essentially at zero, and so it was not possible to cut the target rate any further.\n\nGiven this constraint on monetary policy, I believe it is important to ask if it is possible to synthesize the effects of a one-year interest rate cut of, say, 100 basis points using fiscal policy tools. In his current and past work, Minneapolis Fed staff researcher Juan Pablo Nicolini and his co-authors have answered this question in the affirmative.2 Their key insight is that there is a broad equivalence between monetary and fiscal policy. They argue that the essence of an FOMC interest rate cut is that it makes current consumption cheaper relative to future consumption. With that in mind, the fiscal authorities can use the time path of consumption taxes to accomplish this same change in relative prices.\n\nIn the remainder of my remarks, I’ll illustrate this insight by describing one particular fiscal policy plan that is equivalent to a 100-basis-point cut by the Fed. The proposal has three parts. The first part is a permanent consumption tax of 100 basis points, instituted with a one-year delay.3 The second part is a permanent decrease in labor income taxes of 100 basis points, also instituted with a one-year delay. The third part is an investment tax credit undertaken in 2011. The Nicolini et al. results demonstrate that, in a wide class of economic models, the effects of this three-part plan would be equivalent to the effects of a 100-basis-point interest rate cut.\n\nIt’s useful to explain the underlying mechanism using the kind of example that all Econ I students have grown to love. Suppose widgets cost $1 each in 2011. Suppose, too, that you can earn 1 percent interest over the coming year, but that inflation is also expected to be 1 percent. With that interest rate, and that inflation rate, any dollar that you save from 2011 into 2012 can also buy a widget. So, with each dollar, you face the trade-off of buying a widget today or buying a widget next year.\n\nNext, let’s understand how an interest rate cut affects this baseline trade-off. Suppose the Fed were able to cut its target interest rate by 100 basis points, without affecting expected inflation all that much. The bank would pass that interest rate cut along, and that means that your bank interest rate would fall from 1 percent to zero. Widgets still cost $1 in 2011, and they still cost $1.01 in 2012. But with the interest rate of zero, you would now have to save $1.01 to be able to buy a widget in 2012. The cut in the interest rate has made buying widgets in 2011 cheaper relative to buying widgets in 2012.\n\nThus, if the Fed were able to cut its target interest rate, saving would become less attractive and borrowing more attractive. Consumers would demand more widgets today. Firms would hire workers to produce more widgets today. Unemployment would decline.\n\nBut now let’s go back to the benchmark case without the interest rate cut. Recall that expected inflation is 1 percent and that your bank is paying you an interest rate of 1 percent. In that context, think about the three-pronged fiscal policy change that I described earlier. The first part is that the fiscal authorities institute a 1 percent tax on consumption goods that starts in 2012 and lasts for the foreseeable future. Widgets still cost $1 in 2011. Inflation is 1 percent and the tax is 1 percent, and so widgets cost $1.02 in 2012. Given the interest rate of 1 percent, you must save $1.01 in 2011 to get a widget in 2012. Just as with the interest rate cut, widgets have become 1 percent cheaper today relative to the future.\n\nThis change in relative prices means that the increase in the consumption tax will stimulate consumption demand in 2011. Why, then, do we need a labor income tax reduction in 2012? The problem is that a consumption tax that begins in 2012 distorts labor supply decisions in a way that interest rate cuts don’t. Consider a worker who makes $20 an hour in 2012 after the various taxes on labor income. If the consumption tax goes up, that worker can buy fewer widgets with each hour of work. Hence, the consumption tax distorts that worker’s decision about how much labor to supply to the market.\n\nThat’s why we need the second part of the plan, under which the fiscal authorities lower taxes on labor income by one percentage point beginning in 2012. With this tax decrease, the worker makes 1 percent more per hour after taxes. The increase in after-tax wages exactly offsets the decrease in purchasing power generated by the consumption tax, and a worker can again buy 20 widgets with each hour of work. As a result, the new plan makes consumption goods cheaper in 2011, but does not provide any additional distortion to labor supply decisions.\n\nAt this point, I’ve talked through the first two parts of the proposal—the permanent increase in consumption taxes and the permanent decrease in labor income taxes. Why do we need a third tax change? Unlike an interest rate cut, the consumption tax that begins in 2012 will deter investment in 2011. The third prong of the proposal is that the fiscal authority should correct this problem by offering an appropriately sized temporary investment tax credit in 2011. The key is that the tax credit need only apply in 2011. In 2012 and thereafter, there is no disincentive effect on investment because the consumption tax is constant.\n\nTo summarize, I have described how to construct a three-pronged fiscal policy that is designed to have the same economic effects as a 100-basis-point cut by the Fed. The 1 percent permanent consumption tax that begins in 2012 stimulates consumption demand in 2011. The permanent reduction in labor income taxes ensures that this new consumption tax does not deter labor supply. Finally, the investment tax credit makes sure that the new consumption tax does not deter investment in 2011.\n\nI’ll make two additional comments about this plan. First, how much would this three-pronged change in taxes cost the American taxpayer? The exact answer to this question would depend on a host of details—details that many of you know a lot more about than I do. But let me offer a very rough calculation. Annual consumption is about $10 trillion, and annual labor income is about $8 trillion. I’ve sketched a plan that involves increasing the tax rate on consumption by 1 percentage point and lowering labor income taxes by 1 percentage point. So, the first two parts of the plan would add about $20 billion per year to government revenue beginning in 2012.\n\nThe plan also involves an appropriately sized investment tax credit. Private gross investment is about $2 trillion. To offset the effect of the consumption tax in 2012, the fiscal authority needs to provide a 1 percent subsidy to this entire amount. Hence, the investment tax credit involves a one-time cost in 2012 of $20 billion. These calculations, while obviously very rough, do indicate that the plan has the potential to be fiscally responsible.4\n\nSecond, I’ve not discussed distributional considerations. Raising consumption taxes by 1 percentage point and lowering labor income taxes by 1 percentage point for all Americans would tend to redistribute the burden of taxes toward lower-income citizens.

            "content": "Thanks for the generous introduction, Howard. I’m delighted to have this opportunity to speak with all of you today, and especially to make my first official visit to Fargo as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Of course, as someone who grew up in Winnipeg, I am very familiar with Fargo and the Red River Valley. My family made many trips down here over the years. I found in Wikipedia that the West Acres Mall opened on August 2, 1972. I can’t remember for sure, but it’s certainly possible that we visited the mall on August 3!\nI’m especially pleased that one of the members of our Minneapolis Board of Directors, Howard Dahl, was here today to introduce me. As you just heard from Howard, he and other members of our board play an important role in the Federal Reserve System, as do members of our advisory councils on agriculture, and small business and labor. I won’t mention all the members of those groups, past and present, who are in attendance today, for the list is long, but I thank you for your service.\nAs Howard just mentioned, I became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis last October. Here’s the start of a rather typical conversation that I would have had with my friends and relatives last fall. “Congratulations! That’s fantastic. Now, what is it that you will do exactly?”\nAs it turns out, the job has a lot of interesting aspects. But I think I’ve been invited to speak here today because I help formulate monetary policy for the United States. So what I plan to do is give you some feel for how this part of my job works. In doing so, I’ll highlight the Federal Reserve’s quintessentially American structure. Unlike the central banks of other countries, you’ll see that ours is specifically designed to draw upon the insights of small-town businesses, farmers and ranchers, and large manufacturers, among others, to formulate monetary policy. Before I proceed, I must remind you that any views I express here today are my own, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nWhat do I mean by an American structure? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts and includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to set the path of short-term interest rates over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. (Actually, in the September meeting, there were only four governors. The good news is that we are back up to six governors, and the White House has nominated Peter Diamond—who just won the Nobel Prize in economics—for the remaining vacancy.) However, the committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and a rotating group of four other presidents (currently Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Boston). I’ll be on the committee in 2011.\nIn this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government. Representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations. The input from the presidents relies critically on information they receive from their districts about local economic performance. We obtain this information through the work of our research staffs—but we also obtain it from business leaders in industries and towns, in my case, across the Upper Midwest. The Federal Reserve System is deliberately designed so that the residents of Main Street are able to have a voice in monetary policy.\nSo how exactly do the FOMC meetings work? In the remainder of my remarks, I’ll take you inside an FOMC meeting. Its structure provides a perfect vehicle to communicate the key considerations confronting monetary policymakers in the United States.\nThe typical FOMC meeting features two so-called go-rounds, in which every president and every governor has a chance to speak without interruption. The first go-round is referred to as the economics go-round. The meeting participants describe their views on current economic conditions and their outlook for future economic conditions. The presidents’ remarks will typically include references to their own local economies, as well as the national and global situation.\nAs part of my contributions to the economics go-round in the last couple of meetings, I discussed my outlook for GDP, inflation, and unemployment. In terms of GDP, I believe that a modest recovery is under way and is likely to continue. In terms of inflation, I expect a slight but welcome uptick over the next 18 months. Finally, in terms of unemployment, I see ongoing problems in labor markets.\nI’ll talk first about GDP. Real GDP growth has been positive in each of the past four quarters, and the government’s final estimate is 1.7 percent for the second quarter of this year. Based on forecasts from our Minneapolis model, I expect that GDP growth will be around 2.4 percent in the second half of 2010 and around 2.5 percent in 2011. Together over 2010 and 2011, I expect that GDP will grow around 2.5 percent per year. In contrast, in my first speech about seven months ago, I predicted that GDP would grow around 3.0 percent per year over 2010 and 2011. There is a recovery under way in the United States. But it is a distinctly modest one—and even more modest than I expected at the beginning of this year.\nLet me turn now to inflation. From the fourth quarter of 2009 through the second quarter of 2010, the change in the PCE price level was just over 0.5 percent, which works out to an annual rate of just over 1 percent. The Fed’s price stability mandate is generally interpreted as maintaining an inflation rate of 2 percent, and 1 percent inflation is often considered to be too low relative to this stricture. I expect inflation to remain at about this level during the rest of this year. However, our Minneapolis forecasting model predicts that it will rise back into the more desirable 1.5-2 percent range by the second half of 2011.\nSo the news about inflation and GDP is in the “OK, but certainly could be better” category. However, the lack of vitality in the U.S. labor market can only be termed disturbing. The national unemployment rate remained at 9.6 percent in September. Private sector job creation remains weak—only 64,000 net private sector jobs were created in September. I do not expect the unemployment rate to decline rapidly, and so I expect it to be above 8.0 percent well into 2012.\nIf one digs deeper into the data, the situation seems even more troubling. The National Bureau of Economic Research dates the end of the recession as having occurred in June 2009. Correspondingly, from June 2009 through August 2010, the demand for labor among employers seemed to rise modestly. Since December 2000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been keeping data on the job openings rate, which is defined as the number of job openings divided by the sum of job openings and employment. It has also been keeping track of the layoffs/discharges rate, which is the fraction of employed people who have been laid off or discharged in a given month. From June 2009 to August 2010, the job openings rate rose by 26 percent. Over the same period, the layoffs/discharges rate fell by nearly 18 percent.\nNonetheless, despite this apparent increase in the demand for labor from employers, the unemployment rate actually went up slightly from June 2009 to August 2010, from 9.5 percent to 9.6 percent. And other measures of labor market performance actually tell an even bleaker story. From June 2009 to August 2010, the employment/population ratio fell from 59.4 percent to 58.5 percent. At the same time, the seasonally adjusted labor force participation rate fell from 65.7 percent to 64.7 percent.\nThat was essentially my input into the economics go-round of the FOMC at the last two meetings. GDP is growing, but more slowly than we would like. Inflation is a little low, but only temporarily. The failure of unemployment—and the labor market more generally—to respond to the modest increase in labor demand is deeply troubling.\nAfter the economics go-round, the FOMC meeting then transitions to its second phase, the policy go-round. Again, the meeting participants have a chance to speak in turn about what they perceived to be the appropriate policy choices for the committee. We all are committed to achieving the Fed’s dual mandate to attain both price stability and maximum employment. The former objective is generally understood as keeping inflation in a tight range around 2 percent. The second part of the mandate is much more of a moving target. Employment is shaped by many determinants beyond the Fed’s control: demographics, social custom, taxes, and so on. The Fed’s job is to keep employment as high as possible, given these other factors.\nCurrently, the FOMC has two quite distinct tools: short-term interest rates and balance sheet management. In terms of the former, the FOMC has set its target range for the fed funds rate at between 0 and 25 basis points. It has committed to keeping the rate in that range for “an extended period,” contingent on economic conditions being appropriate. The FOMC is also maintaining a portfolio of roughly $2.3 trillion. Over 2 trillion of those dollars are invested in Treasury securities or government-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government-sponsored enterprises.\nIn his address at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s annual policy forum in August, Chairman Bernanke described three ways to use these tools if the FOMC chooses to provide further stimulus. The first is to buy more long-term securities. The second is to offer more forward guidance in the FOMC statement. The third is to reduce the interest on excess reserves (IOER) by 15 or even 25 basis points. As Chairman Bernanke indicated, using these tools does not come without costs, and due consideration must be made of both costs and benefits. Along those lines, I will discuss my thoughts on how these tools impact the economy. Again, I must underscore that my thoughts are my own and do not represent the views of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nLet me talk first about forward guidance. In part, firms make their decisions about capital expenditures and hiring by comparing the returns to those internal projects to the inflation-adjusted yields available in financial markets for investments of similar horizon. Thus, the real yields on medium-term and long-term government bonds matter for firm investment decisions. Those yields are, in part, shaped by current expectations of future short-term interest rates. The current FOMC statement shapes those expectations by providing forward guidance about its future plans for the behavior of the fed funds target.\nRight now, the FOMC states that it will keep the fed funds target range exceptionally low for as long as economic conditions warrant. The statement also predicts that exceptionally low fed funds rates are likely to be warranted for an “extended period” of time. In this way, the statement influences current expectations of future short-term rates and thereby shapes current medium- and long-term interest rates. The FOMC could provide stimulus by saying that it predicts that low rates are likely to be warranted for an even longer period of time than an “extended period.” This kind of stronger language should lead to a decline in medium-term and long-term interest rates.\nI view lowering the IOER as another form of forward guidance. I think that it is unlikely that lowering the IOER by 15 or 25 basis points will have much direct effect on loan markets. However, it is likely that investors would view this move as a signal that the FOMC is planning to keep its target rate even lower for an even longer period of time. In that way, lowering the IOER would serve to lower medium-term and long-term interest rates.\nSo, the FOMC can influence the economy through various forms of forward guidance about how long it plans for the fed funds rate to be so low. However, the FOMC has another tool at its disposal: what is often termed quantitative easing—QE for short. Under quantitative easing, the FOMC buys long-term securities in the open market. In exchange for those securities, it credits the sellers’ accounts at the Fed with more reserves. The upshot is that there are fewer long-term securities being held by private investors, and banks hold more reserves.\nJust to be clear on one point: The FOMC is only authorized by Congress to buy a limited set of securities. Ideas like “the FOMC should buy corporate bonds” would require a change to the Federal Reserve Act—a change that I for one would view as undesirable. In meetings earlier this year, FOMC participants indicated their strong preference to return to an all-Treasury portfolio. So, I’ll proceed in this speech under the presumption is that any new purchases would take the form of long-term Treasuries. But, as I’ll discuss, the idea behind QE is that the yields on those long-term Treasuries will affect yields on all long-term securities.\nI see QE as affecting the economy in four main ways. I’ll first discuss them from a theoretical perspective and then discuss what’s known about these effects empirically.\nThe first effect of QE is that it represents another form of forward guidance about the path of the fed funds rate. It is a way for the FOMC to signal—in a perhaps more striking way—that it plans to keep the fed funds rate low for an even longer time to come.\nSecond, QE creates more reserves in banks’ accounts with the Fed. The standard intuition is that this kind of reserve creation is inflationary. Banks can only offer checkable deposits in proportion to their reserves. Economists view checkable deposits as a form of money because, like cash, checkable deposits make many transactions easier. In this sense, bank reserves held with the Fed are licenses for banks to create a certain amount of money. By giving out more licenses, the FOMC is allowing banks to create more money. More money chasing the same amount of goods—voila, inflation.\nThis basic logic isn’t valid in current circumstances, because reserves are paying interest equal to comparable market interest rates. Banks have nearly $1 trillion of excess reserves. This means that they are not using a lot of their existing licenses to create money. QE gives them new licenses to create money, but I do not see why they would suddenly start to use the new ones if they weren’t using the old ones. With that said, I have indicated in earlier speeches that $1 trillion of excess reserves does create a potential for high inflation at some point in the future if the FOMC does not react sufficiently fast when it starts to see inflationary pressures. But I do not see this risk as being heightened in any meaningful way by banks holding even more excess reserves than what they are holding today.\nThe third effect of QE is the one that is usually stressed: It reduces the exposure of the private sector to interest rate risk. The holder of a long-term Treasury is exposed to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the price of the bond falls, and the bondholder is less wealthy. Now think about an example of QE in which the Fed buys $1 billion of 10-year Treasuries. On the margin, the bond portfolio of the private sector is now less exposed to interest rate risk. As a consequence, private investors will demand a lower premium for holding other bonds that are exposed to interest rate risk. All long-term yields fall, and so firms should be more willing to undertake long-term capital expansions or hire permanent employees.\nThe fourth effect of QE is less widely discussed. The Fed cannot literally eliminate the exposure of the economy to the risk of fluctuations in the real interest rate. It can only shift that risk among people in the economy. So, where did that risk go when the Fed bought the long-term bond? The answer is to taxpayers.\nTo see this more clearly, suppose hypothetically that the Treasury wants to borrow $1 billion today and is choosing between two ways of doing so. One way is to issue a 20-year, zero-coupon, inflation-indexed bond. The bond requires the Treasury to repay $1.5 billion in real terms in 20 years (roughly a 2 percent real yield). Under this plan, taxpayers face no tax risk, but the buyers of the bond can lose a lot if real interest rates rise greatly. The other way is to issue $1 billion of one-year indexed bonds and then keep rolling over that debt for 20 years. Now, taxpayers have to repay a lot more than $1.5 billion in 20 years if short-term real interest rates end up being high.\nBasically, if the government uses short-term debt, it exposes taxpayers to interest rate risk. If it uses long-term government debt, it exposes the bondholders to interest rate risk. QE is a special case of this general principle: When the Fed buys long-term government debt from the private market, it shifts interest rate risk from bondholders to taxpayers.\nWhat is the ultimate impact on the overall economy of this shift in risk? In the baseline models used by central banks, all bondholders are taxpayers. In these models, QE is essentially shifting risk from one pocket to another. As a result, the increase in tax risk (what I’m calling the fourth effect of QE) completely undoes the decrease in interest rate risk (the third effect of QE). QE ends up having no effects, except for those associated with any new forward guidance that it signals.1\nQE will have nontrivial effects over forward guidance in the context of a more realistic model in which people differ from one another in some relevant way. Along those lines, we might think that some people are active participants in the Treasury markets. Others are not. Then, if the Fed buys long-term Treasuries, it takes risk from the former group and imposes it on the second group. The ultimate macroeconomic impact of QE depends on the extent to which the extra tax risk deters economic activity on the part of this second group. We know little about this effect, either theoretically or empirically.\nTo this stage, my discussion of QE has been purely theoretical in nature. The Fed engaged in QE from January 2009 through March 2010 by buying over $1.5 trillion worth of agency debt, agency mortgage-backed securities, and Treasuries. How did this operation—termed the Large-Scale Asset Purchase, or LSAP program—affect the economy? We don’t know as much as we would like as yet. However, I think that the best empirical work on the question of how the LSAP affected long-term Treasury yields has been done by Gagnon, Raskin, Remache, and Sack (2010). The paper is a thorough investigation of this key issue. My conclusion from their work is that the LSAP reduced the term premium on 10-year Treasury bonds relative to 2-year Treasury bonds by about 40-80 basis points (on an annualized basis). (The term premium is a measure of the difference in yields that is not explained by the expected path of short-term interest rates.) This fall in term premia led to a slightly smaller fall in the term premia of corporate bonds.\nThese estimates are extremely useful benchmarks. My own guess is that further uses of QE would have a more muted effect on Treasury term premia. Financial markets are functioning much better in late 2010 than they were in early 2009. As a result, the relevant spreads are lower, and I suspect that it will be somewhat more challenging for the Fed to impact them.\nI’ve talked about three possible tools—lowering the IOER, strengthening the forward guidance in the FOMC statement, and quantitative easing. As I mentioned earlier, Chairman Bernanke observed in his August 27 speech that each of these tools has benefits and drawbacks that must be balanced against each other. With QE, I would say that the multiple novel effects make the calculus even more difficult than usual.\nSo, I’ve taken you through a typical FOMC meeting and the monetary policy situation in the United States. My discussion may have struck you as somewhat technical, and this is no accident. The FOMC meeting participants are a group of unabashed technocrats, seeking to solve an unabashedly technical problem: How do we manage monetary policy so as to ensure lower unemployment and maintain inflation at an appropriate rate? We certainly disagree with one another on occasion. But our disagreements ultimately stem from different assessments of the complicated economic situation and not from political differences.\nI believe that the apolitical nature of the FOMC’s work hinges critically on another aspect of central bank structure, and that has to do with the Federal Reserve’s relationship with the U.S. Congress. On the one hand, the Federal Reserve is a creation of Congress. It has the power to amend the Fed’s responsibilities, as the recent financial reform legislation certainly attests. The Senate approves the presidential appointments to the Board of Governors. Both chambers receive regular reports from the Board of Governors on the conduct of monetary policy, financial supervision, and the payments system. In addition, the Federal Reserve undergoes regular audits of its finances and various operations.\nOn the other hand, Congress has intentionally removed itself from the direct conduct of monetary policy by granting the Federal Reserve the independence to perform this function on its own. In effect, Congress has said that it does not want monetary policy unduly affected by political considerations. This independence is not only a hallmark of this country’s central bank, but is also a characteristic of developed economies worldwide.\nSo I’ve talked about a lot of issues today, and I could certainly talk about a lot more. But I have a feeling that you’ve got plenty of questions, and we are likely to hit on many key topics. So I will stop here and happily take your questions.\nThank you once again for this opportunity.\n1 For example, Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) prove that QE has no real or inflationary impact over forward guidance in their representative agent New Keynesian model. In their proof, they assume that taxes are not distorting.\nReferences\nEggertsson, Gauti B., and Michael Woodford. 2003. “The Zero Bound on Interest rates and Optimal Monetary Policy.” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity 1, 139–211.\nGagnon, Joseph, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack. 2010. “Large-Scale Asset Purchases by the Federal Reserve: Did They Work?” Staff Report 441. Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThanks for the generous introduction, Howard. I’m delighted to have this opportunity to speak with all of you today, and especially to make my first official visit to Fargo as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Of course, as someone who grew up in Winnipeg, I am very familiar with Fargo and the Red River Valley. My family made many trips down here over the years. I found in Wikipedia that the West Acres Mall opened on August 2, 1972. I can’t remember for sure, but it’s certainly possible that we visited the mall on August 3!\n\nI’m especially pleased that one of the members of our Minneapolis Board of Directors, Howard Dahl, was here today to introduce me. As you just heard from Howard, he and other members of our board play an important role in the Federal Reserve System, as do members of our advisory councils on agriculture, and small business and labor. I won’t mention all the members of those groups, past and present, who are in attendance today, for the list is long, but I thank you for your service.\n\nAs Howard just mentioned, I became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis last October. Here’s the start of a rather typical conversation that I would have had with my friends and relatives last fall. “Congratulations! That’s fantastic. Now, what is it that you will do exactly?”\n\nAs it turns out, the job has a lot of interesting aspects. But I think I’ve been invited to speak here today because I help formulate monetary policy for the United States. So what I plan to do is give you some feel for how this part of my job works. In doing so, I’ll highlight the Federal Reserve’s quintessentially American structure. Unlike the central banks of other countries, you’ll see that ours is specifically designed to draw upon the insights of small-town businesses, farmers and ranchers, and large manufacturers, among others, to formulate monetary policy. Before I proceed, I must remind you that any views I express here today are my own, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhat do I mean by an American structure? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts and includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\n\nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to set the path of short-term interest rates over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. (Actually, in the September meeting, there were only four governors. The good news is that we are back up to six governors, and the White House has nominated Peter Diamond—who just won the Nobel Prize in economics—for the remaining vacancy.) However, the committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and a rotating group of four other presidents (currently Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Boston). I’ll be on the committee in 2011.\n\nIn this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government. Representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations. The input from the presidents relies critically on information they receive from their districts about local economic performance. We obtain this information through the work of our research staffs—but we also obtain it from business leaders in industries and towns, in my case, across the Upper Midwest. The Federal Reserve System is deliberately designed so that the residents of Main Street are able to have a voice in monetary policy.\n\nSo how exactly do the FOMC meetings work? In the remainder of my remarks, I’ll take you inside an FOMC meeting. Its structure provides a perfect vehicle to communicate the key considerations confronting monetary policymakers in the United States.\n\nThe typical FOMC meeting features two so-called go-rounds, in which every president and every governor has a chance to speak without interruption. The first go-round is referred to as the economics go-round. The meeting participants describe their views on current economic conditions and their outlook for future economic conditions.

Together over 2010 and 2011, I expect that GDP will grow around 2.5 percent per year. In contrast, in my first speech about seven months ago, I predicted that GDP would grow around 3.0 percent per year over 2010 and 2011. There is a recovery under way in the United States. But it is a distinctly modest one—and even more modest than I expected at the beginning of this year.\n\nLet me turn now to inflation.

I expect inflation to remain at about this level during the rest of this year. However, our Minneapolis forecasting model predicts that it will rise back into the more desirable 1.5-2 percent range by the second half of 2011.\n\nSo the news about inflation and GDP is in the “OK, but certainly could be better” category. However, the lack of vitality in the U.S. labor market can only be termed disturbing. The national unemployment rate remained at 9.6 percent in September. Private sector job creation remains weak—only 64,000 net private sector jobs were created in September. I do not expect the unemployment rate to decline rapidly, and so I expect it to be above 8.0 percent well into 2012.\n\nIf one digs deeper into the data, the situation seems even more troubling.

The other way is to issue $1 billion of one-year indexed bonds and then keep rolling over that debt for 20 years. Now, taxpayers have to repay a lot more than $1.5 billion in 20 years if short-term real interest rates end up being high.\n\nBasically, if the government uses short-term debt, it exposes taxpayers to interest rate risk. If it uses long-term government debt, it exposes the bondholders to interest rate risk. QE is a special case of this general principle: When the Fed buys long-term government debt from the private market, it shifts interest rate risk from bondholders to taxpayers.\n\nWhat is the ultimate impact on the overall economy of this shift in risk? In the baseline models used by central banks, all bondholders are taxpayers. In these models, QE is essentially shifting risk from one pocket to another. As a result, the increase in tax risk (what I’m calling the fourth effect of QE) completely undoes the decrease in interest rate risk (the third effect of QE). QE ends up having no effects, except for those associated with any new forward guidance that it signals.1\n\nQE will have nontrivial effects over forward guidance in the context of a more realistic model in which people differ from one another in some relevant way. Along those lines, we might think that some people are active participants in the Treasury markets. Others are not. Then, if the Fed buys long-term Treasuries, it takes risk from the former group and imposes it on the second group. The ultimate macroeconomic impact of QE depends on the extent to which the extra tax risk deters economic activity on the part of this second group. We know little about this effect, either theoretically or empirically.\n\nTo this stage, my discussion of QE has been purely theoretical in nature. The Fed engaged in QE from January 2009 through March 2010 by buying over $1.5 trillion worth of agency debt, agency mortgage-backed securities, and Treasuries. How did this operation—termed the Large-Scale Asset Purchase, or LSAP program—affect the economy? We don’t know as much as we would like as yet. However, I think that the best empirical work on the question of how the LSAP affected long-term Treasury yields has been done by Gagnon, Raskin, Remache, and Sack (2010). The paper is a thorough investigation of this key issue. My conclusion from their work is that the LSAP reduced the term premium on 10-year Treasury bonds relative to 2-year Treasury bonds by about 40-80 basis points (on an annualized basis). (The term premium is a measure of the difference in yields that is not explained by the expected path of short-term interest rates.) This fall in term premia led to a slightly smaller fall in the term premia of corporate bonds.\n\nThese estimates are extremely useful benchmarks. My own guess is that further uses of QE would have a more muted effect on Treasury term premia. Financial markets are functioning much better in late 2010 than they were in early 2009. As a result, the relevant spreads are lower, and I suspect that it will be somewhat more challenging for the Fed to impact them.\n\nI’ve talked about three possible tools—lowering the IOER, strengthening the forward guidance in the FOMC statement, and quantitative easing. As I mentioned earlier, Chairman Bernanke observed in his August 27 speech that each of these tools has benefits and drawbacks that must be balanced against each other. With QE, I would say that the multiple novel effects make the calculus even more difficult than usual.\n\nSo, I’ve taken you through a typical FOMC meeting and the monetary policy situation in the United States. My discussion may have struck you as somewhat technical, and this is no accident. The FOMC meeting participants are a group of unabashed technocrats, seeking to solve an unabashedly technical problem: How do we manage monetary policy so as to ensure lower unemployment and maintain inflation at an appropriate rate? We certainly disagree with one another on occasion. But our disagreements ultimately stem from different assessments of the complicated economic situation and not from political differences.\n\nI believe that the apolitical nature of the FOMC’s work hinges critically on another aspect of central bank structure, and that has to do with the Federal Reserve’s relationship with the U.S. Congress. On the one hand, the Federal Reserve is a creation of Congress. It has the power to amend the Fed’s responsibilities, as the recent financial reform legislation certainly attests. The Senate approves the presidential appointments to the Board of Governors. Both chambers receive regular reports from the Board of Governors on the conduct of monetary policy, financial supervision, and the payments system. In addition, the Federal Reserve undergoes regular audits of its finances and various operations.\n\nOn the other hand, Congress has intentionally removed itself from the direct conduct of monetary policy by granting the Federal Reserve the independence to perform this function on its own. In effect, Congress has said that it does not want monetary policy unduly affected by political considerations. This independence is not only a hallmark of this country’s central bank, but is also a characteristic of developed economies worldwide.\n\nSo I’ve talked about a lot of issues today, and I could certainly talk about a lot more. But I have a feeling that you’ve got plenty of questions, and we are likely to hit on many key topics. So I will stop here and happily take your questions.\n\nThank you once again for this opportunity.\n\nEggertsson, Gauti B., and Michael Woodford. 2003. “The Zero Bound on Interest rates and Optimal Monetary Policy.” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity 1, 139–211.\n\nGagnon, Joseph, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack. 2010. “Large-Scale Asset Purchases by the Federal Reserve: Did They Work?” Staff Report 441.

I’m delighted to have this opportunity to speak with you today, especially on this special occasion—the 25th anniversary of the UMACHA conference. So let me begin by congratulating all of you on the longevity of this important event, and also on its success. It goes without saying that there have been many changes in the payments industry over the last quarter century, and likewise many challenges. I am certain that having a venue like this to come together and learn has greatly benefited the industry, and I am proud of the role that we have played at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis to make this event happen.\nMost people probably don’t realize the extent to which the Federal Reserve is active in the payments system. For example, as you just heard, I became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis last October. Here’s the start of a rather typical conversation that I would have had with my friends and relatives last fall. “Congratulations! That’s fantastic. Now, what is it that you will do exactly?” They were delighted when I began telling them about FedACH.\nBut I don’t think I’ve been invited here today because of my expertise in matters relating to RDFI ACH audit requirements. Rather, I think I’m here because I help formulate monetary policy for the United States. So what I plan to do is give you some feel for how this part of my job works. In doing so, I’ll highlight the Federal Reserve’s quintessentially American structure. Unlike the central banks of other countries, you’ll see that ours is specifically designed to draw upon the insights of small-town businesses, farmers and ranchers, and large manufacturers, among others, to formulate monetary policy. Before I proceed, I must remind you that any views I express here today are my own, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nWhat do I mean by an American structure? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts and includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to set the path of short-term interest rates over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. (Actually, in the September meeting, there were only four governors. The good news is that we are back up to six governors, and the White House has nominated Peter Diamond—who just won the Nobel Prize in economics—for the remaining vacancy.) However, the committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and a rotating group of four other presidents (currently Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Boston). I’ll be on the committee in 2011.\nIn this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government. Representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations. The input from the presidents relies critically on information they receive from their districts about local economic performance. We obtain this information through the work of our research staffs—but we also obtain it from business leaders in industries and towns, in my case, across the Upper Midwest. The Federal Reserve System is deliberately designed so that the residents of Main Street are able to have a voice in monetary policy.\nSo how, exactly, do the FOMC meetings work? In the remainder of my remarks, I’ll take you inside an FOMC meeting. Its structure provides a perfect vehicle to communicate the key considerations confronting monetary policymakers in the United States.\nThe typical FOMC meeting features two so-called go-rounds, in which every president and every governor has a chance to speak without interruption. The first go-round is referred to as the economics go-round. The meeting participants describe their views on current economic conditions and their outlook for future economic conditions. The presidents’ remarks will typically include references to their own local economies, as well as the national and global situation.\nAs part of my contributions to the economics go-round in the last couple of meetings, I discussed my outlook for GDP, inflation, and unemployment. In terms of GDP, I believe that a modest recovery is under way and is likely to continue. In terms of inflation, I expect a slight but welcome uptick over the next 18 months. Finally, in terms of unemployment, I see ongoing problems in labor markets.\nI’ll talk first about GDP. Real GDP growth has been positive in each of the past four quarters, and the government’s final estimate is 1.7 percent for the second quarter of this year. Based on forecasts from our Minneapolis model, I expect that GDP growth will be around 2.4 percent in the second half of 2010 and around 2.5 percent in 2011. Together over 2010 and 2011, I expect that GDP will grow around 2.5 percent per year. In contrast, in my first speech about seven months ago, I predicted that GDP would grow around 3.0 percent per year over 2010 and 2011. There is a recovery under way in the United States. But it is a distinctly modest one—and even more modest than I expected at the beginning of this year.\nLet me turn now to inflation. From the fourth quarter of 2009 through the second quarter of 2010, the change in the PCE price level was just over 0.5 percent, which works out to an annual rate of just over 1 percent. The Fed’s price stability mandate is generally interpreted as maintaining an inflation rate of 2 percent, and 1 percent inflation is often considered to be too low relative to this stricture. I expect inflation to remain at about this level during the rest of this year. However, our Minneapolis forecasting model predicts that it will rise back into the more desirable 1.5-2 percent range in the second half of 2011.\nSo the news about inflation and GDP is in the “OK, but certainly could be better” category. However, the lack of vitality in the U.S. labor market can only be termed disturbing. The national unemployment rate remained at 9.6 percent in September. Private sector job creation remains weak—only 64,000 net private sector jobs were created in September. I do not expect the unemployment rate to decline rapidly, and so I expect it to be above 8.0 percent well into 2012.\nIf one digs deeper into the data, the situation seems even more troubling. The National Bureau of Economic Research dates the end of the recession as having occurred in June 2009. Correspondingly, from June 2009 through August 2010, the demand for labor among employers seemed to rise modestly. Since December 2000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been keeping data on the job openings rate, which is defined as the number of job openings divided by the sum of job openings and employment. It has also been keeping track of the layoffs/discharges rate, which is the fraction of employed people who have been laid off or discharged in a given month. From June 2009 to August 2010, the job openings rate rose by 26 percent. Over the same period, the layoffs/discharges rate fell by nearly 18 percent.\nNonetheless, despite this apparent increase in the demand for labor from employers, the unemployment rate actually went up slightly from June 2009 to August 2010, from 9.5 percent to 9.6 percent. And other measures of labor market performance actually tell an even bleaker story. From June 2009 to August 2010, the employment/population ratio fell from 59.4 percent to 58.5 percent. At the same time, the seasonally adjusted labor force participation rate fell from 65.7 percent to 64.7 percent.\nThat was essentially my input into the economics go-round of the FOMC at the last two meetings. GDP is growing, but more slowly than we would like. Inflation is a little low, but only temporarily. The failure of unemployment—and the labor market more generally—to respond to the modest increase in labor demand is deeply troubling.\nAfter the economics go-round, the FOMC meeting then transitions to its second phase, the policy go-round. Again, the meeting participants have a chance to speak in turn about what they perceive to be the appropriate policy choices for the committee. We all are committed to achieving the Fed’s dual mandate to attain both price stability and maximum employment. The former objective is generally understood as keeping inflation in a tight range around 2 percent. The second part of the mandate is much more of a moving target. Employment is shaped by many determinants beyond the Fed’s control: demographics, social custom, taxes, and so on. The Fed’s job is to keep employment as high as possible, given these other factors.\nCurrently, the FOMC has two quite distinct tools: short-term interest rates and balance sheet management. In terms of the former, the FOMC has set its target range for the fed funds rate at between 0 and 25 basis points. It has committed to keeping the rate in that range for “an extended period,” contingent on economic conditions being appropriate. The FOMC is also maintaining a portfolio of roughly $2.3 trillion. Over 2 trillion of those dollars are invested in Treasury securities or government-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government-sponsored enterprises.\nIn his address at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s annual policy forum in August, Chairman Bernanke described three ways to use these tools if the FOMC chooses to provide further stimulus. The first is to buy more long-term securities. The second is to offer more forward guidance in the FOMC statement. The third is to reduce the interest on excess reserves (IOER) by 15 or even 25 basis points. As Chairman Bernanke indicated, using these tools does not come without costs, and due consideration must be made of both costs and benefits. Along those lines, I will discuss my thoughts on how these tools impact the economy. Again, I must underscore that my thoughts are my own and do not represent the views of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nLet me talk first about forward guidance. In part, firms make their decisions about capital expenditures and hiring by comparing the returns to those internal projects to the inflation-adjusted yields available in financial markets for investments of similar horizon. Thus, the real yields on medium-term and long-term government bonds matter for firm investment decisions. Those yields are, in part, shaped by current expectations of future short-term interest rates. The current FOMC statement shapes those expectations by providing forward guidance about its future plans for the behavior of the fed funds target.\nRight now, the FOMC states that it will keep the fed funds target range exceptionally low for as long as economic conditions warrant. The statement also predicts that exceptionally low fed funds rates are likely to be warranted for an “extended period” of time. In this way, the statement influences current expectations of future short-term rates and thereby shapes current medium- and long-term interest rates. The FOMC could provide stimulus by saying that it predicts that low rates are likely to be warranted for an even longer period of time than an “extended period.” This kind of stronger language should lead to a decline in medium-term and long-term interest rates.\nI view lowering the IOER as another form of forward guidance. I think that it is unlikely that lowering the IOER by 15 or 25 basis points will have much direct effect on loan markets. However, it is likely that investors would view this move as a signal that the FOMC is planning to keep its target rate even lower for an even longer period of time. In that way, lowering the IOER would serve to lower medium-term and long-term interest rates.\nSo, the FOMC can influence the economy through various forms of forward guidance about how long it plans for the fed funds rate to be so low. However, the FOMC has another tool at its disposal: what is often termed quantitative easing—QE for short. Under quantitative easing, the FOMC buys long-term securities in the open market. In exchange for those securities, it credits the sellers’ accounts at the Fed with more reserves. The upshot is that there are fewer long-term securities being held by private investors, and banks hold more reserves.\nJust to be clear on one point: The FOMC is only authorized by Congress to buy a limited set of securities. Ideas like “the FOMC should buy corporate bonds” would require a change to the Federal Reserve Act—a change that I for one would view as undesirable. In meetings earlier this year, FOMC participants indicated their strong preference to return to an all-Treasury portfolio. So, I’ll proceed in this speech under the presumption that any new purchases would take the form of long-term Treasuries. But, as I’ll discuss, the idea behind QE is that the yields on those long-term Treasuries will affect yields on all long-term securities.\nI see QE as affecting the economy in four main ways. I’ll first discuss them from a theoretical perspective and then discuss what’s known about these effects empirically.\nThe first effect of QE is that it represents another form of forward guidance about the path of the fed funds rate. It is a way for the FOMC to signal—in a perhaps more striking way—that it plans to keep the fed funds rate low for an even longer time to come.\nSecond, QE creates more reserves in banks’ accounts with the Fed. The standard intuition is that this kind of reserve creation is inflationary. Banks can only offer checkable deposits in proportion to their reserves. Economists view checkable deposits as a form of money because, like cash, checkable deposits make many transactions easier. In this sense, bank reserves held with the Fed are licenses for banks to create a certain amount of money. By giving out more licenses, the FOMC is allowing banks to create more money. More money chasing the same amount of goods—voila, inflation.\nThis basic logic isn’t valid in current circumstances, because reserves are paying interest equal to comparable market interest rates. Banks have nearly $1 trillion of excess reserves. This means that they are not using a lot of their existing licenses to create money. QE gives them new licenses to create money, but I do not see why they would suddenly start to use the new ones if they weren’t using the old ones. With that said, I have indicated in earlier speeches that $1 trillion of excess reserves does create a potential for high inflation at some point in the future if the FOMC does not react sufficiently fast when it starts to see inflationary pressures. But I do not see this risk as being heightened in any meaningful way by banks holding even more excess reserves than what they are holding today.\nThe third effect of QE is the one that is usually stressed: It reduces the exposure of the private sector to interest rate risk. The holder of a long-term Treasury is exposed to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the price of the bond falls, and the bondholder is less wealthy. Now think about an example of QE in which the Fed buys $1 billion of 10-year Treasuries. On the margin, the bond portfolio of the private sector is now less exposed to interest rate risk. As a consequence, private investors will demand a lower premium for holding other bonds that are exposed to interest rate risk. All long-term yields fall, and so firms should be more willing to undertake long-term capital expansions or hire permanent employees.\nThe fourth effect of QE is less widely discussed. The Fed cannot literally eliminate the exposure of the economy to the risk of fluctuations in the real interest rate. It can only shift that risk among people in the economy. So, where did that risk go when the Fed bought the long-term bond? The answer is to taxpayers.\nTo see this more clearly, suppose hypothetically that the Treasury wants to borrow $1 billion today and is choosing between two ways of doing so. One way is to issue a 20-year, zero-coupon, inflation-indexed bond. The bond requires the Treasury to repay $1.5 billion in real terms in 20 years (roughly a 2 percent real yield). Under this plan, taxpayers face no tax risk, but the buyers of the bond can lose a lot if real interest rates rise greatly. The other way is to issue $1 billion of one-year indexed bonds and then keep rolling over that debt for 20 years. Now, taxpayers have to repay a lot more than $1.5 billion in 20 years if short-term real interest rates end up being high.\nBasically, if the government uses short-term debt, it exposes taxpayers to interest rate risk. If it uses long-term government debt, it exposes the bondholders to interest rate risk. QE is a special case of this general principle: When the Fed buys long-term government debt from the private market, it shifts interest rate risk from bondholders to taxpayers.\nWhat is the ultimate impact on the overall economy of this shift in risk? In the baseline models used by central banks, all bondholders are taxpayers. In these models, QE is essentially shifting risk from one pocket to another. As a result, the increase in tax risk (what I’m calling the fourth effect of QE) completely undoes the decrease in interest rate risk (the third effect of QE). QE ends up having no effects, except for those associated with any new forward guidance that it signals.1\nQE will have nontrivial effects over forward guidance in the context of a more realistic model in which people differ from one another in some relevant way. Along those lines, we might think that some people are active participants in the Treasury markets. Others are not. Then, if the Fed buys long-term Treasuries, it takes risk from the former group and imposes it on the second group. The ultimate macroeconomic impact of QE depends on the extent to which the extra tax risk deters economic activity on the part of this second group. We know little about this effect, either theoretically or empirically.\nTo this stage, my discussion of QE has been purely theoretical in nature. The Fed engaged in QE from January 2009 through March 2010 by buying over $1.5 trillion worth of agency debt, agency mortgage-backed securities, and Treasuries.

(The term premium is a measure of the difference in yields that is not explained by the expected path of short-term interest rates.) This fall in term premia led to a slightly smaller fall in the term premia of corporate bonds.\nThese estimates are extremely useful benchmarks.

But I have a feeling that you’ve got plenty of questions, and we are likely to hit on many key topics. So I will stop here and happily take your questions.\nThank you once again for this opportunity.\n1 For example, Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) prove that QE has no real or inflationary impact over forward guidance in their representative agent New Keynesian model. In their proof, they assume that taxes are not distorting.\nReferences\nEggertsson, Gauti B., and Michael Woodford. 2003. “The Zero Bound on Interest rates and Optimal Monetary Policy.” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity 1, 139–211.\nGagnon, Joseph, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack. 2010. “Large-Scale Asset Purchases by the Federal Reserve: Did They Work?” Staff Report 441. Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThank you for the generous introduction. I’m delighted to have this opportunity to speak with you today, especially on this special occasion—the 25th anniversary of the UMACHA conference.

However, our Minneapolis forecasting model predicts that it will rise back into the more desirable 1.5-2 percent range in the second half of 2011.\n\nSo the news about inflation and GDP is in the “OK, but certainly could be better” category. However, the lack of vitality in the U.S. labor market can only be termed disturbing. The national unemployment rate remained at 9.6 percent in September. Private sector job creation remains weak—only 64,000 net private sector jobs were created in September. I do not expect the unemployment rate to decline rapidly, and so I expect it to be above 8.0 percent well into 2012.\n\nIf one digs deeper into the data, the situation seems even more troubling. The National Bureau of Economic Research dates the end of the recession as having occurred in June 2009. Correspondingly, from June 2009 through August 2010, the demand for labor among employers seemed to rise modestly. Since December 2000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been keeping data on the job openings rate, which is defined as the number of job openings divided by the sum of job openings and employment. It has also been keeping track of the layoffs/discharges rate, which is the fraction of employed people who have been laid off or discharged in a given month. From June 2009 to August 2010, the job openings rate rose by 26 percent. Over the same period, the layoffs/discharges rate fell by nearly 18 percent.\n\nNonetheless, despite this apparent increase in the demand for labor from employers, the unemployment rate actually went up slightly from June 2009 to August 2010, from 9.5 percent to 9.6 percent. And other measures of labor market performance actually tell an even bleaker story. From June 2009 to August 2010, the employment/population ratio fell from 59.4 percent to 58.5 percent. At the same time, the seasonally adjusted labor force participation rate fell from 65.7 percent to 64.7 percent.\n\nThat was essentially my input into the economics go-round of the FOMC at the last two meetings. GDP is growing, but more slowly than we would like. Inflation is a little low, but only temporarily. The failure of unemployment—and the labor market more generally—to respond to the modest increase in labor demand is deeply troubling.\n\nAfter the economics go-round, the FOMC meeting then transitions to its second phase, the policy go-round. Again, the meeting participants have a chance to speak in turn about what they perceive to be the appropriate policy choices for the committee. We all are committed to achieving the Fed’s dual mandate to attain both price stability and maximum employment. The former objective is generally understood as keeping inflation in a tight range around 2 percent. The second part of the mandate is much more of a moving target. Employment is shaped by many determinants beyond the Fed’s control: demographics, social custom, taxes, and so on. The Fed’s job is to keep employment as high as possible, given these other factors.\n\nCurrently, the FOMC has two quite distinct tools: short-term interest rates and balance sheet management. In terms of the former, the FOMC has set its target range for the fed funds rate at between 0 and 25 basis points. It has committed to keeping the rate in that range for “an extended period,” contingent on economic conditions being appropriate. The FOMC is also maintaining a portfolio of roughly $2.3 trillion. Over 2 trillion of those dollars are invested in Treasury securities or government-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government-sponsored enterprises.\n\nIn his address at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s annual policy forum in August, Chairman Bernanke described three ways to use these tools if the FOMC chooses to provide further stimulus. The first is to buy more long-term securities. The second is to offer more forward guidance in the FOMC statement. The third is to reduce the interest on excess reserves (IOER) by 15 or even 25 basis points. As Chairman Bernanke indicated, using these tools does not come without costs, and due consideration must be made of both costs and benefits. Along those lines, I will discuss my thoughts on how these tools impact the economy. Again, I must underscore that my thoughts are my own and do not represent the views of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nLet me talk first about forward guidance. In part, firms make their decisions about capital expenditures and hiring by comparing the returns to those internal projects to the inflation-adjusted yields available in financial markets for investments of similar horizon. Thus, the real yields on medium-term and long-term government bonds matter for firm investment decisions. Those yields are, in part, shaped by current expectations of future short-term interest rates. The current FOMC statement shapes those expectations by providing forward guidance about its future plans for the behavior of the fed funds target.\n\nRight now, the FOMC states that it will keep the fed funds target range exceptionally low for as long as economic conditions warrant. The statement also predicts that exceptionally low fed funds rates are likely to be warranted for an “extended period” of time. In this way, the statement influences current expectations of future short-term rates and thereby shapes current medium- and long-term interest rates. The FOMC could provide stimulus by saying that it predicts that low rates are likely to be warranted for an even longer period of time than an “extended period.” This kind of stronger language should lead to a decline in medium-term and long-term interest rates.\n\nI view lowering the IOER as another form of forward guidance. I think that it is unlikely that lowering the IOER by 15 or 25 basis points will have much direct effect on loan markets. However, it is likely that investors would view this move as a signal that the FOMC is planning to keep its target rate even lower for an even longer period of time. In that way, lowering the IOER would serve to lower medium-term and long-term interest rates.\n\nSo, the FOMC can influence the economy through various forms of forward guidance about how long it plans for the fed funds rate to be so low. However, the FOMC has another tool at its disposal: what is often termed quantitative easing—QE for short. Under quantitative easing, the FOMC buys long-term securities in the open market. In exchange for those securities, it credits the sellers’ accounts at the Fed with more reserves. The upshot is that there are fewer long-term securities being held by private investors, and banks hold more reserves.\n\nJust to be clear on one point: The FOMC is only authorized by Congress to buy a limited set of securities. Ideas like “the FOMC should buy corporate bonds” would require a change to the Federal Reserve Act—a change that I for one would view as undesirable. In meetings earlier this year, FOMC participants indicated their strong preference to return to an all-Treasury portfolio. So, I’ll proceed in this speech under the presumption that any new purchases would take the form of long-term Treasuries. But, as I’ll discuss, the idea behind QE is that the yields on those long-term Treasuries will affect yields on all long-term securities.\n\nI see QE as affecting the economy in four main ways. I’ll first discuss them from a theoretical perspective and then discuss what’s known about these effects empirically.\n\nThe first effect of QE is that it represents another form of forward guidance about the path of the fed funds rate. It is a way for the FOMC to signal—in a perhaps more striking way—that it plans to keep the fed funds rate low for an even longer time to come.\n\nSecond, QE creates more reserves in banks’ accounts with the Fed. The standard intuition is that this kind of reserve creation is inflationary. Banks can only offer checkable deposits in proportion to their reserves. Economists view checkable deposits as a form of money because, like cash, checkable deposits make many transactions easier. In this sense, bank reserves held with the Fed are licenses for banks to create a certain amount of money. By giving out more licenses, the FOMC is allowing banks to create more money. More money chasing the same amount of goods—voila, inflation.\n\nThis basic logic isn’t valid in current circumstances, because reserves are paying interest equal to comparable market interest rates. Banks have nearly $1 trillion of excess reserves. This means that they are not using a lot of their existing licenses to create money. QE gives them new licenses to create money, but I do not see why they would suddenly start to use the new ones if they weren’t using the old ones. With that said, I have indicated in earlier speeches that $1 trillion of excess reserves does create a potential for high inflation at some point in the future if the FOMC does not react sufficiently fast when it starts to see inflationary pressures. But I do not see this risk as being heightened in any meaningful way by banks holding even more excess reserves than what they are holding today.\n\nThe third effect of QE is the one that is usually stressed: It reduces the exposure of the private sector to interest rate risk. The holder of a long-term Treasury is exposed to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the price of the bond falls, and the bondholder is less wealthy. Now think about an example of QE in which the Fed buys $1 billion of 10-year Treasuries. On the margin, the bond portfolio of the private sector is now less exposed to interest rate risk. As a consequence, private investors will demand a lower premium for holding other bonds that are exposed to interest rate risk. All long-term yields fall, and so firms should be more willing to undertake long-term capital expansions or hire permanent employees.\n\nThe fourth effect of QE is less widely discussed. The Fed cannot literally eliminate the exposure of the economy to the risk of fluctuations in the real interest rate. It can only shift that risk among people in the economy. So, where did that risk go when the Fed bought the long-term bond? The answer is to taxpayers.\n\nTo see this more clearly, suppose hypothetically that the Treasury wants to borrow $1 billion today and is choosing between two ways of doing so. One way is to issue a 20-year, zero-coupon, inflation-indexed bond. The bond requires the Treasury to repay $1.5 billion in real terms in 20 years (roughly a 2 percent real yield). Under this plan, taxpayers face no tax risk, but the buyers of the bond can lose a lot if real interest rates rise greatly. The other way is to issue $1 billion of one-year indexed bonds and then keep rolling over that debt for 20 years. Now, taxpayers have to repay a lot more than $1.5 billion in 20 years if short-term real interest rates end up being high.\n\nBasically, if the government uses short-term debt, it exposes taxpayers to interest rate risk. If it uses long-term government debt, it exposes the bondholders to interest rate risk. QE is a special case of this general principle: When the Fed buys long-term government debt from the private market, it shifts interest rate risk from bondholders to taxpayers.\n\nWhat is the ultimate impact on the overall economy of this shift in risk? In the baseline models used by central banks, all bondholders are taxpayers. In these models, QE is essentially shifting risk from one pocket to another. As a result, the increase in tax risk (what I’m calling the fourth effect of QE) completely undoes the decrease in interest rate risk (the third effect of QE). QE ends up having no effects, except for those associated with any new forward guidance that it signals.1\n\nQE will have nontrivial effects over forward guidance in the context of a more realistic model in which people differ from one another in some relevant way. Along those lines, we might think that some people are active participants in the Treasury markets. Others are not. Then, if the Fed buys long-term Treasuries, it takes risk from the former group and imposes it on the second group. The ultimate macroeconomic impact of QE depends on the extent to which the extra tax risk deters economic activity on the part of this second group. We know little about this effect, either theoretically or empirically.\n\nTo this stage, my discussion of QE has been purely theoretical in nature. The Fed engaged in QE from January 2009 through March 2010 by buying over $1.5 trillion worth of agency debt, agency mortgage-backed securities, and Treasuries. How did this operation—termed the Large-Scale Asset Purchase, or LSAP program—affect the economy? We don’t know as much as we would like as yet. However, I think that the best empirical work on the question of how the LSAP affected long-term Treasury yields has been done by Gagnon, Raskin, Remache, and Sack (2010). The paper is a thorough investigation of this key issue. My conclusion from their work is that the LSAP reduced the term premium on 10-year Treasury bonds relative to 2-year Treasury bonds by about 40-80 basis points (on an annualized basis). (The term premium is a measure of the difference in yields that is not explained by the expected path of short-term interest rates.) This fall in term premia led to a slightly smaller fall in the term premia of corporate bonds.\n\nThese estimates are extremely useful benchmarks. My own guess is that further uses of QE would have a more muted effect on Treasury term premia. Financial markets are functioning much better in late 2010 than they were in early 2009. As a result, the relevant spreads are lower, and I suspect that it will be somewhat more challenging for the Fed to impact them.\n\nI’ve talked about three possible tools—lowering the IOER, strengthening the forward guidance in the FOMC statement, and quantitative easing. As I mentioned earlier, Chairman Bernanke observed in his August 27 speech that each of these tools has benefits and drawbacks that must be balanced against each other. With QE, I would say that the multiple novel effects make the calculus even more difficult than usual.\n\nSo, I’ve taken you through a typical FOMC meeting and the monetary policy situation in the United States. My discussion may have struck you as somewhat technical, and this is no accident. The FOMC meeting participants are a group of unabashed technocrats, seeking to solve an unabashedly technical problem: How do we manage monetary policy so as to ensure lower unemployment and maintain inflation at an appropriate rate? We certainly disagree with one another on occasion. But our disagreements ultimately stem from different assessments of the complicated economic situation and not from political differences.\n\nI believe that the apolitical nature of the FOMC’s work hinges critically on another aspect of central bank structure, and that has to do with the Federal Reserve’s relationship with the U.S. Congress. On the one hand, the Federal Reserve is a creation of Congress. It has the power to amend the Fed’s responsibilities, as the recent financial reform legislation certainly attests. The Senate approves the presidential appointments to the Board of Governors. Both chambers receive regular reports from the Board of Governors on the conduct of monetary policy, financial supervision, and the payments system. In addition, the Federal Reserve undergoes regular audits of its finances and various operations.\n\nOn the other hand, Congress has intentionally removed itself from the direct conduct of monetary policy by granting the Federal Reserve the independence to perform this function on its own. In effect, Congress has said that it does not want monetary policy unduly affected by political considerations. This independence is not only a hallmark of this country’s central bank, but is also a characteristic of developed economies worldwide.\n\nSo I’ve talked about a lot of issues today, and I could certainly talk about a lot more. But I have a feeling that you’ve got plenty of questions, and we are likely to hit on many key topics. So I will stop here and happily take your questions.\n\nThank you once again for this opportunity.\n\n\n\nEggertsson, Gauti B., and Michael Woodford. 2003. “The Zero Bound on Interest rates and Optimal Monetary Policy.” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity 1, 139–211.\n\nGagnon, Joseph, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack. 2010. “Large-Scale Asset Purchases by the Federal Reserve: Did They Work?” Staff Report 441.

            "content": "Thanks for the generous introduction. I’m delighted to have this opportunity to speak with you today.\nAs you just heard, I became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis last October. Here’s the start of a rather typical conversation that I would have had with my friends and relatives last fall. “Congratulations! That’s fantastic. Now, what is it that you will do exactly?”\nAs it turns out, the job has a lot of interesting aspects. But I think I’ve been invited to speak here today because I help formulate monetary policy for the United States. So what I plan to do is give you some feel for how this part of my job works. In doing so, I’ll highlight the Federal Reserve’s quintessentially American structure. Unlike the central banks of other countries, you’ll see that ours is specifically designed to draw upon the insights of small-town businesses, farmers and ranchers, and large manufacturers, among others, to formulate monetary policy. Before I proceed, I must remind you that any views I express here today are my own, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nWhat do I mean by an American structure? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank’s district extends from the Rocky Mountains on the west to the Great Lakes in the east and borders Canada, an area roughly four times the size of the U.K. However, the U.K. has about seven times the population.  \nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to set the path of short-term interest rates over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. (Actually, in the meeting last week, there were only four governors. The good news is that the White House has nominated three excellent candidates for the three vacancies.) However, the committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and a rotating group of four other presidents (currently Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Boston). I’ll be on the committee in 2011.\nIn this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government. Representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations. The input from the presidents relies critically on information they receive from their districts about local economic performance. We obtain this information through the work of our research staffs—but we also obtain it from people in industries and towns, in my case, across the Upper Midwest. The Federal Reserve System is deliberately designed so that the residents of Main Street—and not just Wall Street—are able to have a voice in monetary policy.\nAs part of my contributions to recent FOMC meetings, I discussed my outlook for GDP, inflation, and unemployment. In terms of GDP, I believe that a modest recovery is under way and is likely to continue. In terms of inflation, I expect a slight but welcome uptick over the next 18 months. Finally, in terms of unemployment, I see ongoing deep problems in labor markets.\nI’ll talk first about GDP. Real GDP growth has been positive in each of the past four quarters, and the government’s second estimate is 1.6 percent for the second quarter of this year. We have recently updated our estimates for future growth from our Minneapolis forecasting model. Our September estimates are distinctly lower than our August estimates. I now expect GDP growth to be around 2.4 percent in the second half of 2010 and around 2.5 percent in 2011. Together over 2010 and 2011, I’m now predicting that GDP will grow around 2.5 percent per year. In contrast, in my first speech about seven months ago, I predicted that GDP would grow around 3.0 percent per year over 2010 and 2011. There is a recovery under way in the United States. But it is a distinctly modest one—and even more modest than I expected at the beginning of this year.\nLet me turn now to inflation. From the fourth quarter of 2009 through the second quarter of 2010, the change in the PCE price level was just over 0.5 percent, which works out to an annual rate of just over 1 percent. The Fed’s price stability mandate is generally interpreted as maintaining an inflation rate of 2 percent, and 1 percent inflation is often considered to be too low relative to this stricture. I expect inflation to remain at about this level during the rest of this year. However, our Minneapolis forecasting model predicts that it will rise back into the more desirable 1.5-2 percent range in 2011.\nSo the news about inflation and GDP is in the “OK, but certainly could be better” category. However, the lack of vitality in the U.S. labor market can only be termed disturbing. The national unemployment rate remained at 9.6 percent in August. Private sector job creation remains weak—only 67,000 net private sector jobs were created in August. I do not expect the unemployment rate to decline rapidly, and so I expect it to be above 8.0 percent well into 2012.\nIf one digs deeper into the data, the situation seems even more troubling. Since December 2000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been keeping data on the job openings rate, which is defined as the number of job openings divided by the sum of job openings and employment. It has also been keeping track of the layoffs/discharges rate, which is the fraction of employed people who have been laid off or discharged in a given month. The job openings rate rose by around 30 percent between July 2009 and July 2010. The layoffs/discharges rate has fallen by over 10 percent over the same period.\nNonetheless, despite this apparent increase in the demand for labor from employers, the unemployment rate actually went up slightly from July 2009 to July 2010, from 9.4 percent to 9.5 percent. And other measures of labor market performance actually tell an even bleaker story. From July 2009 to July 2010, the employment/population ratio fell from 59.3 percent to 58.4 percent. At the same time, the seasonally adjusted labor force participation rate fell from 65.4 percent to 64.6 percent. This was the biggest July-over-July fall in the 60-plus year history of that statistic.\nTo summarize: GDP is growing, but more slowly than I expected or than we would like. Inflation is a little low, but only temporarily. The behavior of unemployment is deeply troubling.\nWith that economic outlook in mind, we can now turn to the choices facing the FOMC if it were to choose to provide more stimulus. Currently, the FOMC has set its target range for the fed funds rate at between 0 and 25 basis points. It has committed to keeping the rate in that range for “an extended period,” contingent on economic conditions being appropriate. The FOMC is also maintaining a portfolio of roughly $2.3 trillion. Over 2 trillion of those dollars are invested in Treasury securities or government-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government-sponsored enterprises.\nIn his address at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s annual policy forum in August, Chairman Bernanke described three possible tools that are available to the FOMC if it chooses to provide further stimulus. The first is to buy more long-term securities. The second is to offer more forward guidance in the FOMC statement. The third is to reduce the interest on excess reserves (IOER) by 15 or even 25 basis points. As Chairman Bernanke indicated, using these tools does not come without costs, and due consideration must be made of both costs and benefits. Along those lines, I will discuss my thoughts on how these tools impact the economy. Again, I must underscore that my thoughts are my own and do not represent the views of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\nLet me talk first about forward guidance. In part, firms make their decisions about capital expenditures and hiring by comparing the returns to those internal projects to the inflation-adjusted yields available in financial markets for investments of similar horizon. Thus, the real yields on medium-term and long-term government bonds matter for firm investment decisions. Those yields are, in part, shaped by current expectations of future short-term interest rates. The current FOMC statement shapes those expectations by providing forward guidance about its future plans for the behavior of the fed funds target.\nRight now, the FOMC states that it will keep the fed funds target range exceptionally low for as long as economic conditions warrant. The statement also predicts that exceptionally low fed funds rates are likely to be warranted for an “extended period” of time. In this way, the statement influences current expectations of future short-term rates and thereby shapes current medium- and long-term interest rates. The FOMC could provide stimulus by saying that it predicts that low rates are likely to be warranted for an even longer period of time than an “extended period.” This kind of stronger language should lead to a decline in medium-term and long-term interest rates.\nI view lowering the IOER as another form of forward guidance. I think that it is unlikely that lowering the IOER by 15 or 25 basis points will have much direct effect on loan markets. However, it is likely that investors would view this move as a signal that the FOMC is planning to keep its target rate even lower for an even longer period of time. In that way, lowering the IOER would serve to lower medium-term and long-term interest rates.\nSo, the FOMC can influence the economy through various forms of forward guidance about how long it plans for the fed funds rate to be so low.

So I will stop here and happily take your questions.\n1 For example, Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) prove that QE has no real or inflationary impact over forward guidance in their representative agent New Keynesian model. In their proof, they assume that taxes are not distorting.\nReferences\nEggertsson, Gauti B., and Michael Woodford. 2003. “The Zero Bound on Interest rates and Optimal Monetary Policy.” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity 1, 139–211.\nGagnon, Joseph, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack. 2010. “Large-Scale Asset Purchases by the Federal Reserve: Did They Work?” Staff Report 441. Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThanks for the generous introduction. I’m delighted to have this opportunity to speak with you today.\n\nAs you just heard, I became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis last October. Here’s the start of a rather typical conversation that I would have had with my friends and relatives last fall. “Congratulations! That’s fantastic. Now, what is it that you will do exactly?”\n\nAs it turns out, the job has a lot of interesting aspects. But I think I’ve been invited to speak here today because I help formulate monetary policy for the United States. So what I plan to do is give you some feel for how this part of my job works. In doing so, I’ll highlight the Federal Reserve’s quintessentially American structure. Unlike the central banks of other countries, you’ll see that ours is specifically designed to draw upon the insights of small-town businesses, farmers and ranchers, and large manufacturers, among others, to formulate monetary policy. Before I proceed, I must remind you that any views I express here today are my own, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhat do I mean by an American structure? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank’s district extends from the Rocky Mountains on the west to the Great Lakes in the east and borders Canada, an area roughly four times the size of the U.K. However, the U.K. has about seven times the population.\n\nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to set the path of short-term interest rates over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. (Actually, in the meeting last week, there were only four governors. The good news is that the White House has nominated three excellent candidates for the three vacancies.) However, the committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and a rotating group of four other presidents (currently Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Boston). I’ll be on the committee in 2011.\n\nIn this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government. Representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations. The input from the presidents relies critically on information they receive from their districts about local economic performance. We obtain this information through the work of our research staffs—but we also obtain it from people in industries and towns, in my case, across the Upper Midwest. The Federal Reserve System is deliberately designed so that the residents of Main Street—and not just Wall Street—are able to have a voice in monetary policy.\n\nAs part of my contributions to recent FOMC meetings, I discussed my outlook for GDP, inflation, and unemployment. In terms of GDP, I believe that a modest recovery is under way and is likely to continue. In terms of inflation, I expect a slight but welcome uptick over the next 18 months. Finally, in terms of unemployment, I see ongoing deep problems in labor markets.\n\nI’ll talk first about GDP. Real GDP growth has been positive in each of the past four quarters, and the government’s second estimate is 1.6 percent for the second quarter of this year. We have recently updated our estimates for future growth from our Minneapolis forecasting model. Our September estimates are distinctly lower than our August estimates. I now expect GDP growth to be around 2.4 percent in the second half of 2010 and around 2.5 percent in 2011. Together over 2010 and 2011, I’m now predicting that GDP will grow around 2.5 percent per year. In contrast, in my first speech about seven months ago, I predicted that GDP would grow around 3.0 percent per year over 2010 and 2011. There is a recovery under way in the United States. But it is a distinctly modest one—and even more modest than I expected at the beginning of this year.\n\nLet me turn now to inflation. From the fourth quarter of 2009 through the second quarter of 2010, the change in the PCE price level was just over 0.5 percent, which works out to an annual rate of just over 1 percent. The Fed’s price stability mandate is generally interpreted as maintaining an inflation rate of 2 percent, and 1 percent inflation is often considered to be too low relative to this stricture. I expect inflation to remain at about this level during the rest of this year. However, our Minneapolis forecasting model predicts that it will rise back into the more desirable 1.5-2 percent range in 2011.\n\nSo the news about inflation and GDP is in the “OK, but certainly could be better” category. However, the lack of vitality in the U.S. labor market can only be termed disturbing. The national unemployment rate remained at 9.6 percent in August. Private sector job creation remains weak—only 67,000 net private sector jobs were created in August. I do not expect the unemployment rate to decline rapidly, and so I expect it to be above 8.0 percent well into 2012.\n\nIf one digs deeper into the data, the situation seems even more troubling. Since December 2000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been keeping data on the job openings rate, which is defined as the number of job openings divided by the sum of job openings and employment. It has also been keeping track of the layoffs/discharges rate, which is the fraction of employed people who have been laid off or discharged in a given month. The job openings rate rose by around 30 percent between July 2009 and July 2010. The layoffs/discharges rate has fallen by over 10 percent over the same period.\n\nNonetheless, despite this apparent increase in the demand for labor from employers, the unemployment rate actually went up slightly from July 2009 to July 2010, from 9.4 percent to 9.5 percent. And other measures of labor market performance actually tell an even bleaker story. From July 2009 to July 2010, the employment/population ratio fell from 59.3 percent to 58.4 percent. At the same time, the seasonally adjusted labor force participation rate fell from 65.4 percent to 64.6 percent. This was the biggest July-over-July fall in the 60-plus year history of that statistic.\n\nTo summarize: GDP is growing, but more slowly than I expected or than we would like. Inflation is a little low, but only temporarily. The behavior of unemployment is deeply troubling.\n\nWith that economic outlook in mind, we can now turn to the choices facing the FOMC if it were to choose to provide more stimulus. Currently, the FOMC has set its target range for the fed funds rate at between 0 and 25 basis points. It has committed to keeping the rate in that range for “an extended period,” contingent on economic conditions being appropriate. The FOMC is also maintaining a portfolio of roughly $2.3 trillion. Over 2 trillion of those dollars are invested in Treasury securities or government-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government-sponsored enterprises.\n\nIn his address at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s annual policy forum in August, Chairman Bernanke described three possible tools that are available to the FOMC if it chooses to provide further stimulus. The first is to buy more long-term securities. The second is to offer more forward guidance in the FOMC statement. The third is to reduce the interest on excess reserves (IOER) by 15 or even 25 basis points. As Chairman Bernanke indicated, using these tools does not come without costs, and due consideration must be made of both costs and benefits. Along those lines, I will discuss my thoughts on how these tools impact the economy. Again, I must underscore that my thoughts are my own and do not represent the views of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nLet me talk first about forward guidance. In part, firms make their decisions about capital expenditures and hiring by comparing the returns to those internal projects to the inflation-adjusted yields available in financial markets for investments of similar horizon. Thus, the real yields on medium-term and long-term government bonds matter for firm investment decisions. Those yields are, in part, shaped by current expectations of future short-term interest rates. The current FOMC statement shapes those expectations by providing forward guidance about its future plans for the behavior of the fed funds target.\n\nRight now, the FOMC states that it will keep the fed funds target range exceptionally low for as long as economic conditions warrant. The statement also predicts that exceptionally low fed funds rates are likely to be warranted for an “extended period” of time. In this way, the statement influences current expectations of future short-term rates and thereby shapes current medium- and long-term interest rates. The FOMC could provide stimulus by saying that it predicts that low rates are likely to be warranted for an even longer period of time than an “extended period.” This kind of stronger language should lead to a decline in medium-term and long-term interest rates.\n\nI view lowering the IOER as another form of forward guidance. I think that it is unlikely that lowering the IOER by 15 or 25 basis points will have much direct effect on loan markets. However, it is likely that investors would view this move as a signal that the FOMC is planning to keep its target rate even lower for an even longer period of time. In that way, lowering the IOER would serve to lower medium-term and long-term interest rates.\n\nSo, the FOMC can influence the economy through various forms of forward guidance about how long it plans for the fed funds rate to be so low. However, the FOMC has another tool at its disposal: what is often termed quantitative easing—QE for short. Under quantitative easing, the FOMC buys long-term securities in the open market. In exchange for those securities, it credits the sellers’ accounts at the Fed with more reserves. The upshot is that there are fewer long-term securities being held by private investors, and banks hold more reserves.\n\nJust to be clear on one point: The FOMC is only authorized by Congress to buy a limited set of securities. Ideas like “the FOMC should buy corporate bonds” would require a change to the Federal Reserve Act—a change that I for one would view as undesirable. In meetings earlier this year, FOMC participants indicated their strong preference to return to an all-Treasury portfolio. So, I’ll proceed in this speech under the presumption that any new purchases would take the form of long-term Treasuries. But, as I’ll discuss, the idea behind QE is that the yields on those long-term Treasuries will affect yields on all long-term securities.\n\nI see QE as affecting the economy in four main ways. I’ll first discuss them from a theoretical perspective and then discuss what’s known about these effects empirically.\n\nThe first effect of QE is that it represents another form of forward guidance about the path of the fed funds rate. It is a way for the FOMC to signal—in a perhaps more striking way—that it plans to keep the fed funds rate low for an even longer time to come.\n\nSecond, QE creates more reserves in banks’ accounts with the Fed. The standard intuition is that this kind of reserve creation is inflationary. Banks can only offer checkable deposits in proportion to their reserves. Economists view checkable deposits as a form of money because, like cash, checkable deposits make many transactions easier. In this sense, bank reserves held with the Fed are licenses for banks to create a certain amount of money. By giving out more licenses, the FOMC is allowing banks to create more money. More money chasing the same amount of goods—voila, inflation.\n\nThis basic logic isn’t valid in current circumstances, because reserves are paying interest equal to comparable market interest rates. Banks have nearly $1 trillion of excess reserves. This means that they are not using a lot of their existing licenses to create money. QE gives them new licenses to create money, but I do not see why they would suddenly start to use the new ones if they weren’t using the old ones. With that said, I have indicated in earlier speeches that $1 trillion of excess reserves does create a potential for high inflation at some point in the future if the FOMC does not react sufficiently fast when it starts to see inflationary pressures. But I do not see this risk as being heightened in any meaningful way by banks holding even more excess reserves than what they are holding today.\n\nThe third effect of QE is the one that is usually stressed: It reduces the exposure of the private sector to interest rate risk. The holder of a long-term Treasury is exposed to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the price of the bond falls, and the bondholder is less wealthy. Now think about an example of QE in which the Fed buys $1 billion of 10-year Treasuries. On the margin, the bond portfolio of the private sector is now less exposed to interest rate risk. As a consequence, private investors will demand a lower premium for holding other bonds that are exposed to interest rate risk. All long-term yields fall, and so firms should be more willing to undertake long-term capital expansions or hire permanent employees.\n\nThe fourth effect of QE is less widely discussed. The Fed cannot literally eliminate the exposure of the economy to the risk of fluctuations in the real interest rate. It can only shift that risk among people in the economy. So, where did that risk go when the Fed bought the long-term bond? The answer is to taxpayers.\n\nTo see this more clearly, suppose hypothetically that the Treasury wants to borrow $1 billion today and is choosing between two ways of doing so. One way is to issue a 20-year, zero coupon, inflation-indexed bond. The bond requires the Treasury to repay $1.5 billion in real terms in 20 years (roughly a 2 percent real yield). Under this plan, taxpayers face no tax risk, but the buyers of the bond can lose a lot if real interest rates rise greatly. The other way is to issue $1 billion of one-year indexed bonds and then keep rolling over that debt for 20 years. Now, taxpayers have to repay a lot more than $1.5 billion in 20 years if short-term real interest rates end up being high.\n\nBasically, if the government uses short-term debt, it exposes taxpayers to interest rate risk. If it uses long-term government debt, it exposes the bondholders to interest rate risk. QE is a special case of this general principle: When the Fed buys long-term government debt from the private market, it shifts interest rate risk from bondholders to taxpayers.\n\nWhat is the ultimate impact on the overall economy of this shift in risk? In the baseline models used by central banks, all bondholders are taxpayers. In these models, QE is essentially shifting risk from one pocket to another. As a result, the increase in tax risk (what I’m calling the fourth effect of QE) completely undoes the decrease in interest rate risk (the third effect of QE). QE ends up having no effects, except for those associated with any new forward guidance that it signals.1\n\nQE will have nontrivial effects over forward guidance in the context of a more realistic model in which people differ from one another in some relevant way. Along those lines, we might think that some people are active participants in the Treasury markets. Others are not. Then, if the Fed buys long-term Treasuries, it takes risk from the former group and imposes it on the second group. The ultimate macroeconomic impact of QE depends on the extent to which the extra tax risk deters economic activity on the part of this second group. We know little about this effect, either theoretically or empirically.\n\nTo this stage, my discussion of QE has been purely theoretical in nature. The Fed engaged in QE from January 2009 through March 2010 by buying over $1.5 trillion worth of agency debt, agency mortgage-backed securities, and Treasuries. How did this operation—termed the Large-Scale Asset Purchase, or LSAP program—affect the economy? We don’t know as much as we would like as yet. However, I think that the best empirical work on the question of how the LSAP affected long-term Treasury yields has been done by Gagnon, Raskin, Remache, and Sack (2010). Their paper is a thorough investigation of this key issue. My conclusion from their work is that the LSAP reduced the term premium on 10-year Treasury bonds relative to 2-year Treasury bonds by about 40-80 basis points (on an annualized basis). (The term premium is a measure of the difference in yields that is not explained by the expected path of short-term interest rates.) This fall in term premia led to a slightly smaller fall in the term premia of corporate bonds.\n\nThese estimates are extremely useful benchmarks. My own guess is that further uses of QE would have a more muted effect on Treasury term premia. Financial markets are functioning much better in late 2010 than they were in early 2009. As a result, the relevant spreads are lower, and I suspect that it will be somewhat more challenging for the Fed to impact them.\n\nI’ve talked about three possible tools—lowering the IOER, strengthening the forward guidance in the FOMC statement, and quantitative easing. As I mentioned earlier, Chairman Bernanke observed in his August 27 speech that each of these tools has benefits and drawbacks that must be balanced against each other. With QE, I would say that the multiple effects make the calculus even more difficult than usual.\n\nSo I’ve talked about a lot of issues today, and I could certainly talk about a lot more. But I have a feeling that you’ve got plenty of questions, and we are likely to hit on many key topics. So I will stop here and happily take your questions.\n\nEggertsson, Gauti B., and Michael Woodford. 2003. “The Zero Bound on Interest rates and Optimal Monetary Policy.” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity 1, 139–211.\n\nGagnon, Joseph, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack. 2010. “Large-Scale Asset Purchases by the Federal Reserve: Did They Work?” Staff Report 441.

            "content": "Thanks for the generous introduction. I’m delighted to have this opportunity to speak with you today, and of course I’m very pleased to make my first official visit to Missoula, here on the western edge of the Federal Reserve’s Ninth District. My most recent speech was near the eastern tip of the district, in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and these trips reinforce not only the diverse nature of the district’s economy for me, but also its natural beauty. And Missoula is certainly second to none in the district when it comes to natural beauty. Of course, that takes nothing away from the Upper Peninsula, or Minnesota, or the Dakotas, or Wisconsin, too, for that matter. You get the picture: We have the most beautiful district in the Federal Reserve System, and you can quote me on that.\nBefore I proceed, I want to acknowledge the presence of the board of directors for our Helena Branch, with whom I had the pleasure to meet this morning: John Franklin, a banker from Sidney; Tim Bartz, an accountant from Helena; Dave Solberg, a rancher from Billings; and Joe McDonald, the recently retired president of Salish Kootenai College in Pablo. In addition to these folks, there are former directors in attendance, as well as members of our advisory councils on small business, labor and agriculture. I won’t name them all, or I would likely have to go through a list of many in this room. However, I think it’s important for people to realize that the Federal Reserve is represented by dedicated citizens like these on all of our bank and branch boards of directors, and I will have more to say on this feature of our Federal Reserve System in a moment. Thanks to all of you for your service.\nOne of the benefits of these trips is that I get to hear how the economy is doing on the ground level, if you will. As you might imagine, we have a lot of data at our fingertips at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, but sometimes statistics don’t tell the whole story. On that note, I’m especially looking forward to the question-and-answer session following my talk. I’ve learned much from the questions at my various speaking engagements and expect that I’ll do the same today.\nAs you just heard, I became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis last October. Here’s the start of a rather typical conversation that I would have had with my friends and relatives last fall. “Congratulations! That’s fantastic. Now, what is it that you will do exactly?”\nAs it turns out, the job has a lot of interesting aspects. But I think I’ve been invited to speak here today because I help formulate monetary policy for the United States. So what I plan to do is give you some feel for how this part of my job works. In doing so, I’ll highlight the Federal Reserve’s quintessentially American structure. Unlike the central banks of other countries, you’ll see that ours is specifically designed to draw upon the insights of small-town businesses, farmers and ranchers, and large manufacturers, among others, to formulate monetary policy. Before I proceed, I must remind you that any views I express here today are my own, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nWhat do I mean by an American structure? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts and includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to set the path of short-term interest rates over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. (Actually, in the August meeting, there were only five governors, and there are now only four after the retirement of Don Kohn. The good news is that the White House has nominated three excellent candidates for the three vacancies.) However, the committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and a rotating group of four other presidents (currently Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Boston). I’ll be on the committee in 2011.\nIn this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government. Representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations. The input from the presidents relies critically on information they receive from their districts about local economic performance. We obtain this information through the work of our research staffs—but we also obtain it from business leaders in industries and towns, in my case, across the Upper Midwest. The Federal Reserve System is deliberately designed so that the residents of Main Street are able to have a voice in monetary policy.\nSo how, exactly, do the FOMC meetings work? In the remainder of my remarks, I’ll take you inside an FOMC meeting. Its structure provides a perfect vehicle to communicate the key considerations confronting monetary policymakers in the United States.\nThe typical FOMC meeting features two so-called go-rounds, in which every president and every governor has a chance to speak without interruption. The first go-round is referred to as the economics go-round. The meeting participants describe their views on current economic conditions and their outlook for future economic conditions. The presidents’ remarks will typically include references to their own local economies, as well as the national and global situation.\nAs part of my contributions to the economics go-round in August, I discussed my outlook for GDP, inflation, and unemployment. In terms of GDP, I believe that a modest recovery is under way and is likely to continue. In terms of inflation, I expect a slight but welcome uptick over the next 18 months. Finally, in terms of unemployment, I see current and future problems in labor markets that may be difficult to combat using the tools of monetary policy.\nI’ll talk first about GDP. Real GDP growth has been positive in each of the past four quarters, and the government’s second estimate is 1.6 percent for the second quarter of this year. Based on estimates from our Minneapolis forecasting model, I expect GDP growth to be around 2.5 percent in the second half of 2010 and close to 3.0 percent in 2011. Together over 2010 and 2011, I’m now predicting that GDP will grow around 2.8 percent per year. In contrast, in my first speech about seven months ago, I predicted that GDP would grow around 3.0 percent per year over 2010 and 2011. There is a recovery under way in the United States. But, as expected, it is a modest one.\nLet me turn now to inflation. From the fourth quarter of 2009 through the second quarter of 2010, the change in the PCE price level was just over 0.5 percent, which works out to an annual rate of just over 1 percent. The Fed’s price stability mandate is generally interpreted as maintaining an inflation rate of 2 percent, and 1 percent inflation is often considered to be too low relative to this stricture. I expect inflation to remain at about this level during the rest of this year. However, our Minneapolis forecasting model predicts that it will rise back into the more desirable 1.5-2 percent range in 2011.\nSo the news about inflation and GDP is in the “good, but certainly could be better” category. However, the lack of vitality in the U.S. labor market can only be termed disturbing. The national unemployment rate remains at 9.6 percent in August. Private sector job creation remains weak—only 67,000 net private sector jobs were created in August. I do not expect the unemployment rate to decline rapidly, and so I expect it to be above 8.0 percent into 2012.\nIf one digs deeper into the data, the situation seems even more troubling. Since December 2000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been keeping data on the job openings rate, which is defined as the number of job openings divided by the sum of job openings and employment. Not surprisingly, when job openings rise, the unemployed can find jobs more readily, and the unemployment rate typically falls. The inverse relationship between the unemployment rate and the job openings rate was extremely stable throughout the 2000-01 recession, the subsequent recovery, and on through the early part of this recession.\nBeginning in June 2008, this stable relationship began to break down, as the unemployment rate rose much faster than could be rationalized by the fall in job openings. Over the past year, the relationship has completely shattered. The job openings rate has risen by about 20 percent between July 2009 and June 2010. Under this scenario, we would expect unemployment to fall because people find it easier to get jobs. However, the unemployment rate actually went up slightly over this period.\nWhat does this change in the relationship between job openings and unemployment connote? The disincentive effects of extended unemployment insurance benefits are one possible cause for this change. However, I suspect that these effects are not all that large. I am comfortable with the San Francisco Fed’s 2009 estimate, which finds that the extensions of benefits have boosted the unemployment rate by 0.4 percent.\nThe bigger issue is mismatch. Firms have jobs, but can’t find appropriate workers. The workers want to work, but can’t find appropriate jobs. There are many possible sources of mismatch—geography, skills, demography—and they probably interact in nontrivial ways. For example, there may be jobs available in eastern Montana and western North Dakota because of the oil boom. But a household in Nevada that is underwater on its mortgage may find it difficult to move to those locations.\nOf course, the key question is: How much of the current unemployment rate is really due to mismatch? The answer seems to be a lot. I mentioned that the relationship between unemployment and job openings was stable from December 2000 through June 2008. Were that stable relationship still in place today, and given the current job opening rate of 2.2 percent, we would have an unemployment rate closer to 6.5 percent, not 9.6 percent.1 Together with the San Francisco Fed’s estimate of the impact of benefits, this analysis implies that over 2.5 percentage points of the current unemployment rate is attributable to mismatch.\nThis estimate is based on a rather aggregative view of the labor market. It is important to dig deeper to get a better understanding of the problem, and there is a considerable amount of research under way exploring the quantitative importance of the various forms of mismatch. For example, the International Monetary Fund has recently released a special study based on a new state-by-state measure of the gap between demand and supply for workers with different levels of educational attainment. The study examines the impact of this variable and the foreclosure rate on state-level unemployment. It estimates that 1.5 percentage points of the national unemployment rate is due to these two sources and their interaction. Thus, according to this study, these two types of mismatch alone can account for a significant fraction of my estimate of 2.5 percentage points.\nGood economic policy is about using the right tool for the problem at hand. The mismatch problems in the labor market do not strike me as readily amenable to the kinds of monetary policy tools currently available to the Fed. But they may well be amenable to other types of policy tools, like job retraining programs or foreclosure mitigation strategies. As Chairman Bernanke said in his Jackson Hole speech in August, central bankers alone cannot solve the world’s economic problems.\nThat was essentially my input into the economics go-round of the FOMC in August. GDP is growing, but more slowly than we would like. Inflation is a little low, but only temporarily. The behavior of unemployment is deeply troubling.\nAfter the economics go-round, the FOMC meeting then transitions to its second phase, the policy go-round. Again, the meeting participants have a chance to speak in turn about what they perceive to be the appropriate policy choices for the committee. We all are committed to achieving the Fed’s dual mandate to attain both price stability and maximum employment. The former objective is generally understood as keeping inflation in a tight range around 2 percent. The second part of the mandate is much more of a moving target. Employment is shaped by many determinants beyond the Fed’s control: demographics, social custom, taxes, and so on. The Fed’s job is to keep employment as high as possible, given these other factors.\nRight now, the committee has to think about two quite distinct policy tools: short-term interest rates and balance sheet management. I’ll talk about both in turn.\nThe federal funds rate—the key short-term interest rate set by the FOMC—has been set at 0-25 basis points for over a year and a half. The FOMC’s August statement contains the following key sentence:\n“The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.” (See the FOMC statement.)\nWhat do we learn from this rather long sentence? As you would hope, there is an intimate connection between my economics summary and what’s in this statement. The unemployment rate is 9.6 percent, and measured inflation is low (below 2 percent). Market and survey measures of expected inflation are also low (also below 2 percent). In its statement, the FOMC is saying: We’re keeping interest rates low to keep unemployment from going any higher, and we feel safe in doing so because there seems to be little threat of inflation.\nLet me turn next to the issue of the Fed’s balance sheet. The Federal Reserve has 2.3 trillion dollars of assets—over 2.5 times what it owned in September 2008. Over 2 trillion dollars of those assets are in Treasuries, debt issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, or mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These MBSs are backed by the U.S. government—the Federal Reserve faces no credit risk in holding them. But they do have another kind of risk called prepayment risk. If long-term interest rates are low, then many people prepay the mortgages in the MBS. The owners of the MBS—in this case, the Fed—get a large coupon payment and the MBS’s principal falls. However, if long-term interest rates are high, then few people make these prepayments.\nThis kind of fluctuation in prepayments is at the heart of the FOMC’s new policy action in August. Long-term interest rates have declined surprisingly fast since April. But the fall in long-term rates led more people to prepay their mortgages. As a result, MBS principal balances were falling. In this sense, the Fed’s holdings of long-term assets were shrinking, leaving a larger share of the long-term risk in the economy in the hands of the private sector. According to estimates in a recent paper,2 this extra risk in private hands could force up the risk premia on long-term bonds by around 20 basis points and be a drag on the recovery. The FOMC decided to arrest the decline in its holdings of long-term assets by reinvesting the principal payments from the MBSs into long-term Treasuries.\nAs I mentioned, I’m not a member of the FOMC during this calendar year and so I did not vote in the August meeting. However, I would have voted for the FOMC statement in August had I actually been a member of the committee.\nSo, I’ve taken you through a typical FOMC meeting and the monetary policy situation in the United States. My discussion may have struck you as rather techy and wonkish—maybe even verging on the nerdy. I’m sure that my colleagues will forgive me for saying that this nerdy quality mirrors the tone of the discussion within the committee itself. There is no inflated political rhetoric. We are unabashed technocrats, seeking to solve an unabashedly technical problem: How do we manage monetary policy so as to ensure lower unemployment and maintain inflation at an appropriate rate? We certainly disagree with one another on occasion. But our disagreements ultimately stem from different assessments of the complicated economic situation and not from political differences.\nI believe that the apolitical nature of the FOMC’s work hinges critically on another aspect of central bank structure, and that has to do with the Federal Reserve’s relationship with the U.S. Congress. On the one hand, the Federal Reserve is a creation of Congress. It has the power to amend the Fed’s responsibilities, as the recent financial reform legislation certainly attests. The Senate approves the presidential appointments to the Board of Governors. Both chambers receive regular reports from the Board of Governors on the conduct of monetary policy, financial supervision, and the payments system. In addition, the Federal Reserve undergoes regular audits of its finances and various operations.\nOn the other hand, Congress has intentionally removed itself from the direct conduct of monetary policy by granting the Federal Reserve the independence to perform this function on its own. In effect, Congress has said that it does not want monetary policy unduly affected by political considerations. This independence is not only a hallmark of this country’s central bank, but is also a characteristic of developed economies worldwide.\nSo I’ve talked about a lot of issues today, and I could certainly talk about a lot more. But I have a feeling that you’ve got plenty of questions, and we are likely to hit on many key topics. So I will stop here and happily take your questions.\nThank you once again for this opportunity.\n1 I use the following procedure to reach these conclusions. I calibrated parameters in Shimer’s (2007) mismatch model to fit the average level of vacancies from December 2000 to December 2007 and the average level of unemployment over the same period. I obtained m = 210.5 and n = 205.5 to fit an average unemployment rate of 5.2 percent and an average vacancy rate of 2.9 percent. (The calibrated parameters differ from Shimer’s own because of data revisions by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.) In June 2008, the unemployment rate was 5.5 percent and the vacancy rate was 2.7 percent; the model implied an unemployment rate of 5.5 percent and a vacancy rate of 2.6 percent if I set n = 204.2. In June 2010, the vacancy rate was 2.2 percent. I set n = 201.8 to match that in the model. At that value of n, the model implied an unemployment rate of 6.3 percent. The value of m in Shimer’s model has changed greatly.\n2 See Gagnon et al. (2010).\nReferences\nGagnon, Joseph, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack. 2010. “Large-Scale Asset Purchases by the Federal Reserve: Did They Work?” Staff Report 441.

I’m delighted to have this opportunity to speak with you today, and of course I’m very pleased to make my first official visit to Missoula, here on the western edge of the Federal Reserve’s Ninth District. My most recent speech was near the eastern tip of the district, in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and these trips reinforce not only the diverse nature of the district’s economy for me, but also its natural beauty. And Missoula is certainly second to none in the district when it comes to natural beauty. Of course, that takes nothing away from the Upper Peninsula, or Minnesota, or the Dakotas, or Wisconsin, too, for that matter. You get the picture: We have the most beautiful district in the Federal Reserve System, and you can quote me on that.\n\nBefore I proceed, I want to acknowledge the presence of the board of directors for our Helena Branch, with whom I had the pleasure to meet this morning: John Franklin, a banker from Sidney; Tim Bartz, an accountant from Helena; Dave Solberg, a rancher from Billings; and Joe McDonald, the recently retired president of Salish Kootenai College in Pablo. In addition to these folks, there are former directors in attendance, as well as members of our advisory councils on small business, labor and agriculture. I won’t name them all, or I would likely have to go through a list of many in this room. However, I think it’s important for people to realize that the Federal Reserve is represented by dedicated citizens like these on all of our bank and branch boards of directors, and I will have more to say on this feature of our Federal Reserve System in a moment. Thanks to all of you for your service.\n\nOne of the benefits of these trips is that I get to hear how the economy is doing on the ground level, if you will. As you might imagine, we have a lot of data at our fingertips at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, but sometimes statistics don’t tell the whole story. On that note, I’m especially looking forward to the question-and-answer session following my talk. I’ve learned much from the questions at my various speaking engagements and expect that I’ll do the same today.\n\nAs you just heard, I became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis last October. Here’s the start of a rather typical conversation that I would have had with my friends and relatives last fall. “Congratulations! That’s fantastic. Now, what is it that you will do exactly?”\n\nAs it turns out, the job has a lot of interesting aspects. But I think I’ve been invited to speak here today because I help formulate monetary policy for the United States. So what I plan to do is give you some feel for how this part of my job works. In doing so, I’ll highlight the Federal Reserve’s quintessentially American structure. Unlike the central banks of other countries, you’ll see that ours is specifically designed to draw upon the insights of small-town businesses, farmers and ranchers, and large manufacturers, among others, to formulate monetary policy. Before I proceed, I must remind you that any views I express here today are my own, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhat do I mean by an American structure? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts and includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\n\nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to set the path of short-term interest rates over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. (Actually, in the August meeting, there were only five governors, and there are now only four after the retirement of Don Kohn. The good news is that the White House has nominated three excellent candidates for the three vacancies.) However, the committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and a rotating group of four other presidents (currently Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Boston). I’ll be on the committee in 2011.\n\nIn this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government. Representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations. The input from the presidents relies critically on information they receive from their districts about local economic performance. We obtain this information through the work of our research staffs—but we also obtain it from business leaders in industries and towns, in my case, across the Upper Midwest. The Federal Reserve System is deliberately designed so that the residents of Main Street are able to have a voice in monetary policy.\n\nSo how, exactly, do the FOMC meetings work? In the remainder of my remarks, I’ll take you inside an FOMC meeting. Its structure provides a perfect vehicle to communicate the key considerations confronting monetary policymakers in the United States.\n\nThe typical FOMC meeting features two so-called go-rounds, in which every president and every governor has a chance to speak without interruption. The first go-round is referred to as the economics go-round. The meeting participants describe their views on current economic conditions and their outlook for future economic conditions. The presidents’ remarks will typically include references to their own local economies, as well as the national and global situation.\n\nAs part of my contributions to the economics go-round in August, I discussed my outlook for GDP, inflation, and unemployment. In terms of GDP, I believe that a modest recovery is under way and is likely to continue. In terms of inflation, I expect a slight but welcome uptick over the next 18 months. Finally, in terms of unemployment, I see current and future problems in labor markets that may be difficult to combat using the tools of monetary policy.\n\nI’ll talk first about GDP. Real GDP growth has been positive in each of the past four quarters, and the government’s second estimate is 1.6 percent for the second quarter of this year. Based on estimates from our Minneapolis forecasting model, I expect GDP growth to be around 2.5 percent in the second half of 2010 and close to 3.0 percent in 2011. Together over 2010 and 2011, I’m now predicting that GDP will grow around 2.8 percent per year. In contrast, in my first speech about seven months ago, I predicted that GDP would grow around 3.0 percent per year over 2010 and 2011. There is a recovery under way in the United States. But, as expected, it is a modest one.\n\nLet me turn now to inflation. From the fourth quarter of 2009 through the second quarter of 2010, the change in the PCE price level was just over 0.5 percent, which works out to an annual rate of just over 1 percent. The Fed’s price stability mandate is generally interpreted as maintaining an inflation rate of 2 percent, and 1 percent inflation is often considered to be too low relative to this stricture. I expect inflation to remain at about this level during the rest of this year. However, our Minneapolis forecasting model predicts that it will rise back into the more desirable 1.5-2 percent range in 2011.\n\nSo the news about inflation and GDP is in the “good, but certainly could be better” category. However, the lack of vitality in the U.S. labor market can only be termed disturbing. The national unemployment rate remains at 9.6 percent in August. Private sector job creation remains weak—only 67,000 net private sector jobs were created in August. I do not expect the unemployment rate to decline rapidly, and so I expect it to be above 8.0 percent into 2012.\n\nIf one digs deeper into the data, the situation seems even more troubling. Since December 2000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been keeping data on the job openings rate, which is defined as the number of job openings divided by the sum of job openings and employment. Not surprisingly, when job openings rise, the unemployed can find jobs more readily, and the unemployment rate typically falls. The inverse relationship between the unemployment rate and the job openings rate was extremely stable throughout the 2000-01 recession, the subsequent recovery, and on through the early part of this recession.\n\nBeginning in June 2008, this stable relationship began to break down, as the unemployment rate rose much faster than could be rationalized by the fall in job openings. Over the past year, the relationship has completely shattered. The job openings rate has risen by about 20 percent between July 2009 and June 2010. Under this scenario, we would expect unemployment to fall because people find it easier to get jobs. However, the unemployment rate actually went up slightly over this period.\n\nWhat does this change in the relationship between job openings and unemployment connote? The disincentive effects of extended unemployment insurance benefits are one possible cause for this change. However, I suspect that these effects are not all that large. I am comfortable with the San Francisco Fed’s 2009 estimate, which finds that the extensions of benefits have boosted the unemployment rate by 0.4 percent.\n\nThe bigger issue is mismatch. Firms have jobs, but can’t find appropriate workers. The workers want to work, but can’t find appropriate jobs. There are many possible sources of mismatch—geography, skills, demography—and they probably interact in nontrivial ways. For example, there may be jobs available in eastern Montana and western North Dakota because of the oil boom. But a household in Nevada that is underwater on its mortgage may find it difficult to move to those locations.\n\nOf course, the key question is: How much of the current unemployment rate is really due to mismatch? The answer seems to be a lot. I mentioned that the relationship between unemployment and job openings was stable from December 2000 through June 2008. Were that stable relationship still in place today, and given the current job opening rate of 2.2 percent, we would have an unemployment rate closer to 6.5 percent, not 9.6 percent.1 Together with the San Francisco Fed’s estimate of the impact of benefits, this analysis implies that over 2.5 percentage points of the current unemployment rate is attributable to mismatch.\n\nThis estimate is based on a rather aggregative view of the labor market. It is important to dig deeper to get a better understanding of the problem, and there is a considerable amount of research under way exploring the quantitative importance of the various forms of mismatch. For example, the International Monetary Fund has recently released a special study based on a new state-by-state measure of the gap between demand and supply for workers with different levels of educational attainment. The study examines the impact of this variable and the foreclosure rate on state-level unemployment. It estimates that 1.5 percentage points of the national unemployment rate is due to these two sources and their interaction. Thus, according to this study, these two types of mismatch alone can account for a significant fraction of my estimate of 2.5 percentage points.\n\nGood economic policy is about using the right tool for the problem at hand. The mismatch problems in the labor market do not strike me as readily amenable to the kinds of monetary policy tools currently available to the Fed. But they may well be amenable to other types of policy tools, like job retraining programs or foreclosure mitigation strategies. As Chairman Bernanke said in his Jackson Hole speech in August, central bankers alone cannot solve the world’s economic problems.\n\nThat was essentially my input into the economics go-round of the FOMC in August. GDP is growing, but more slowly than we would like. Inflation is a little low, but only temporarily. The behavior of unemployment is deeply troubling.\n\nAfter the economics go-round, the FOMC meeting then transitions to its second phase, the policy go-round. Again, the meeting participants have a chance to speak in turn about what they perceive to be the appropriate policy choices for the committee. We all are committed to achieving the Fed’s dual mandate to attain both price stability and maximum employment. The former objective is generally understood as keeping inflation in a tight range around 2 percent. The second part of the mandate is much more of a moving target. Employment is shaped by many determinants beyond the Fed’s control: demographics, social custom, taxes, and so on. The Fed’s job is to keep employment as high as possible, given these other factors.\n\nRight now, the committee has to think about two quite distinct policy tools: short-term interest rates and balance sheet management. I’ll talk about both in turn.\n\nThe federal funds rate—the key short-term interest rate set by the FOMC—has been set at 0-25 basis points for over a year and a half. The FOMC’s August statement contains the following key sentence:\n\n“The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.” (See the FOMC statement.)\n\nWhat do we learn from this rather long sentence? As you would hope, there is an intimate connection between my economics summary and what’s in this statement. The unemployment rate is 9.6 percent, and measured inflation is low (below 2 percent). Market and survey measures of expected inflation are also low (also below 2 percent). In its statement, the FOMC is saying: We’re keeping interest rates low to keep unemployment from going any higher, and we feel safe in doing so because there seems to be little threat of inflation.\n\nLet me turn next to the issue of the Fed’s balance sheet. The Federal Reserve has 2.3 trillion dollars of assets—over 2.5 times what it owned in September 2008. Over 2 trillion dollars of those assets are in Treasuries, debt issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, or mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These MBSs are backed by the U.S. government—the Federal Reserve faces no credit risk in holding them. But they do have another kind of risk called prepayment risk. If long-term interest rates are low, then many people prepay the mortgages in the MBS. The owners of the MBS—in this case, the Fed—get a large coupon payment and the MBS’s principal falls. However, if long-term interest rates are high, then few people make these prepayments.\n\nThis kind of fluctuation in prepayments is at the heart of the FOMC’s new policy action in August. Long-term interest rates have declined surprisingly fast since April. But the fall in long-term rates led more people to prepay their mortgages. As a result, MBS principal balances were falling. In this sense, the Fed’s holdings of long-term assets were shrinking, leaving a larger share of the long-term risk in the economy in the hands of the private sector. According to estimates in a recent paper,2 this extra risk in private hands could force up the risk premia on long-term bonds by around 20 basis points and be a drag on the recovery. The FOMC decided to arrest the decline in its holdings of long-term assets by reinvesting the principal payments from the MBSs into long-term Treasuries.\n\nAs I mentioned, I’m not a member of the FOMC during this calendar year and so I did not vote in the August meeting. However, I would have voted for the FOMC statement in August had I actually been a member of the committee.\n\nSo, I’ve taken you through a typical FOMC meeting and the monetary policy situation in the United States. My discussion may have struck you as rather techy and wonkish—maybe even verging on the nerdy. I’m sure that my colleagues will forgive me for saying that this nerdy quality mirrors the tone of the discussion within the committee itself. There is no inflated political rhetoric. We are unabashed technocrats, seeking to solve an unabashedly technical problem: How do we manage monetary policy so as to ensure lower unemployment and maintain inflation at an appropriate rate?

But I have a feeling that you’ve got plenty of questions, and we are likely to hit on many key topics. So I will stop here and happily take your questions.\n\nThank you once again for this opportunity.\n\nGagnon, Joseph, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack. 2010. “Large-Scale Asset Purchases by the Federal Reserve: Did They Work?” Staff Report 441.

This is my first trip to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and I look forward to many more. I want to take this opportunity to thank Bob Jacquart, who was instrumental in helping us set up this meeting. Bob served on one of our economic advisory councils a few years ago, and I know that others in this room have served on such councils or on our bank’s board of directors.

The first go-round is referred to as the economics go-round. The meeting participants describe their views on current economic conditions and their outlook for future economic conditions. The presidents’ remarks will typically include references to their own local economies, as well as the national and global situation.\nAs part of my contributions to the economics go-round in August, I discussed my outlook for gross domestic product (GDP), inflation, and unemployment. In terms of GDP, I believe that a modest recovery is under way and is likely to continue. In terms of inflation, I expect a slight but welcome uptick over the next 18 months. Finally, in terms of unemployment, I see current and future problems in labor markets that are likely to continue to prove resistant to the tools of monetary policy.\nI’ll talk first about GDP. Real GDP growth has been positive in each of the past four quarters, and the government’s initial estimate is that GDP grew at an annualized rate of 2.4 percent in the second quarter of this year. Based on estimates from our Minneapolis forecasting model, I expect GDP growth to be around 2.5 percent in the second half of 2010 and close to 3.0 percent in 2011. There is a recovery under way in the United States, and I expect it to continue.\nAs last week’s FOMC statement says, though, the pace of the recovery is more modest than I would have anticipated. We are four quarters into the recovery, and real GDP per person is still about 3.2 percent below its level in the fourth quarter of 2007 when the recession began. In some sense, this number actually understates the economic problem. Typically, real GDP per person grows between 1.5 and 2 percent per year. If the economy had actually grown at that rate over the past two and a half years, we would have between 7 and 8.2 percent more output per person than we do right now. My forecast is such that we will not make up that 7-8.2 percent lost output anytime soon.\nLet me turn now to inflation. From the fourth quarter of 2009 through the second quarter of 2010, the change in the PCE (personal consumption expenditures) price level was just over 0.5 percent, which works out to an annual rate of just over 1 percent. The Fed’s price stability mandate is generally interpreted as maintaining an inflation rate of 2 percent, and 1 percent inflation is often considered to be too low relative to this stricture. I expect it to remain at about this level during the rest of this year. However, our Minneapolis forecasting model predicts that it will rise back into the more desirable 1.5-2 percent range in 2011.\nSo the news about inflation and GDP is in the “good, but certainly could be better” category. However, the lack of vitality in the U.S. labor market can only be termed disturbing. The national unemployment rate remains at 9.5 percent in July. Private sector job creation remains weak—only 71,000 net private sector jobs were created in July.\nIf one digs deeper into the data, the situation seems even more troubling. Since December 2000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been keeping data on the job openings rate, which is defined as the number of job openings divided by the sum of job openings and employment. Not surprisingly, when job openings rise, the unemployed can find jobs more readily, and the unemployment rate typically falls. The inverse relationship between unemployment and job openings was extremely stable throughout the 2000-01 recession, the subsequent recovery, and on through the early part of this recession.\nBeginning in June 2008, this stable relationship began to break down, as the unemployment rate rose much faster than could be rationalized by the fall in the job openings rate. Over the past year, the relationship has completely shattered. The job openings rate has risen by about 20 percent between July 2009 and June 2010. Under this scenario, we would expect unemployment to fall because people find it easier to get jobs. However, the unemployment rate actually went up slightly over this period.\nWhat does this change in the relationship between job openings and unemployment connote? In a word, mismatch. Firms have jobs, but can’t find appropriate workers. The workers want to work, but can’t find appropriate jobs. There are many possible sources of mismatch—geography, skills, demography—and they are probably all at work. Whatever the source, though, it is hard to see how the Fed can do much to cure this problem. Monetary stimulus has provided conditions so that manufacturing plants want to hire new workers. But the Fed does not have a means to transform construction workers into manufacturing workers.\nOf course, the key question is: How much of the current unemployment rate is really due to mismatch, as opposed to conditions that the Fed can readily ameliorate? The answer seems to be a lot. I mentioned that the relationship between unemployment and job openings was stable from December 2000 through June 2008. Were that stable relationship still in place today, and given the current job opening rate of 2.2 percent, we would have an unemployment rate of closer to 6.5 percent, not 9.5 percent. Most of the existing unemployment represents mismatch that is not readily amenable to monetary policy.1\nGiven the structural problems in the labor market, I do not expect unemployment to decline rapidly. My own prediction is that unemployment will remain above 8 percent into 2012. Persistently high unemployment of this kind will impose considerable losses on many of our citizens. Good public policy requires that we help mitigate their losses via a well-designed unemployment insurance program. Recent economic research, including some done at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, shows that such a program will not feature the termination of benefits after 26, 52, or 99 weeks. Instead, a good insurance program should offer constant benefits over the entire duration of an unemployment spell, however long. It should provide incentives only through the level of those benefits, not through their timing.2\nThat was essentially my input about the national economy in the economics go-round of the FOMC last week. GDP is growing, but more slowly than we would like. Inflation is a little low, but only temporarily. The behavior of unemployment is deeply troubling.\nAfter the economics go-round, the FOMC meeting then transitions to its second phase, the policy go-round. Again, the 17 meeting participants have a chance to speak in turn about what they perceive to be the appropriate policy choices for the committee. We are all committed to achieving the Fed’s dual mandate to attain both price stability and maximum employment.

In terms of its future level, the FOMC’s statement last week contains the following key sentence:\n“The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.”\nWhat do we learn from this rather long sentence? As you would hope, there is an intimate connection between my economic summary and what’s in this statement. The unemployment rate is 9.5 percent, and measured inflation is low (below 2 percent). Market and survey measures of expected inflation are also low (also below 2 percent). In its statement, the FOMC is saying: We’re keeping interest rates low to keep unemployment from going any higher, and we feel safe in doing so because there seems to be little threat of inflation.\nLet me turn next to the issue of the Fed’s balance sheet. The Federal Reserve has 2.3 trillion dollars of assets—over 2.5 times what it owned in September 2008. Over 2 trillion dollars of those assets are in Treasuries, debt issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, or mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These MBSs are not toxic assets in any sense of the word—they are fully backed by the U.S. government, and so the Federal Reserve faces no credit risk in holding them.  But the MBSs do have another kind of risk called prepayment risk. If long-term interest rates are low, then many people prepay the mortgages in the MBS. The owners of the MBS—in this case, the Fed—get a large coupon payment and the MBS’s principal falls. However, if long-term interest rates are high, then few people make these prepayments.\nThis kind of fluctuation in prepayments is at the heart of the FOMC’s new policy action in August. Long-term interest rates declined surprisingly fast in the past three months. But the fall in long-term rates meant that more people were prepaying their mortgages, and the Fed’s MBS principal balances were falling. In this sense, the Fed’s holdings of long-term assets were shrinking, leaving a larger share of the long-term risk in the economy in the hands of the private sector. This extra risk in private hands could force up the risk premia on long-term bonds and be a drag on the real economy. The FOMC decided to arrest the decline in its holdings of long-term assets by re-investing the principal payments from the MBSs into long-term Treasuries.\nThe FOMC’s decision has had a larger impact on financial markets than I would have anticipated. My own interpretation is that the FOMC action led investors to believe that the economic situation in the United States was worse than they, the investors, had imagined. In my view, this reaction is unwarranted. The FOMC’s decisions were largely predicated on publicly available data about real GDP, its various components, unemployment, and inflation. I would say that there is no new information about the current state of the economy to be learned from the FOMC’s actions or its statement.\nSo, I’ve taken you through a typical FOMC meeting and the monetary policy situation in the United States. My discussion may have struck you as rather techy and wonkish—maybe even verging on the nerdy. I’m sure that my colleagues will forgive me for saying that this nerdy quality mirrors the tone of the discussion within the meeting itself. There is no inflated political rhetoric. We are unabashed technocrats, seeking to solve an unabashedly technical problem: How do we manage monetary policy so as to ensure lower unemployment and maintain inflation at an appropriate rate? We certainly disagree with one another on occasion. But our disagreements ultimately stem from different assessments of the complicated economic situation and not from political differences.\nI believe that the apolitical nature of the FOMC’s work hinges critically on another aspect of central bank structure, and that has to do with the Federal Reserve’s relationship with the U.S. Congress. On the one hand, the Federal Reserve is a creation of Congress. It has the power to amend the Fed’s responsibilities, as the recent financial reform legislation certainly attests. The Senate approves the presidential appointments to the Board of Governors. Both chambers receive regular reports from the Board of Governors on the conduct of monetary policy, financial supervision, and the payments system. In addition, the Federal Reserve undergoes regular audits of its finances and various operations.\nOn the other hand, Congress has intentionally removed itself from the direct conduct of monetary policy by granting the Federal Reserve the independence to perform this function on its own. In effect, Congress has said that it does not want monetary policy unduly affected by political considerations. This independence not only is a hallmark of this country’s central bank, but is also a characteristic of developed economies worldwide.\nAs I said, the FOMC meets eight times a year. Its decisions are always influenced by fairly recent economic data. But, at the same time, its decision-making has to be shaped by long-run considerations. In that vein, let me close by offering some thoughts about long-run inflation—or really, long-run deflation. I mentioned earlier that inflation has been near 1 percent recently. These data have led some observers to worry about the possibility of a multiyear period of falling prices—that is, persistent deflation. I don’t see this possibility as likely. It would require the FOMC to make the surprising mistake of ignoring the long run in its desire to fix the short run.\nHere’s what I mean. It is conventional for central banks to attribute deflationary outcomes to temporary shortfalls in aggregate demand. Given that interpretation, central banks then respond to deflation by easing monetary policy in order to generate extra demand. Unfortunately, this conventional response leads to problems if followed for too long. The fed funds rate is roughly the sum of two components: the real, net-of-inflation, return on safe short-term investments and anticipated inflation. Monetary policy does affect the real return on safe investments over short periods of time. But over the long run, money is, as we economists like to say, neutral. This means that no matter what the inflation rate is and no matter what the FOMC does, the real return on safe short-term investments averages about 1-2 percent over the long run.\nLong-run monetary neutrality is an uncontroversial, simple, but nonetheless profound proposition. In particular, it implies that if the FOMC maintains the fed funds rate at its current level of 0-25 basis points for too long, both anticipated and actual inflation have to become negative. Why? It’s simple arithmetic. Let’s say that the real rate of return on safe investments is 1 percent and we need to add an amount of anticipated inflation that will result in a fed funds rate of 0.25 percent. The only way to get that is to add a negative number—in this case, –0.75 percent.\nTo sum up, over the long run, a low fed funds rate must lead to consistent—but low—levels of deflation. The good news is that it is certainly possible to eliminate this eventuality through smart policy choices. Right now, the real safe return on short-term investments is negative because of various headwinds in the real economy. Again, using our simple arithmetic, this negative real return combined with the near-zero fed funds rate means that inflation must be positive. Eventually, the real economy will improve sufficiently that the real return to safe short-term investments will normalize at its more typical positive level. The FOMC has to be ready to increase its target rate soon thereafter.\nThat sounds easy—but it’s not. When real returns are normalized, inflationary expectations could well be negative, and there may still be a considerable amount of structural unemployment. If the FOMC hews too closely to conventional thinking, it might be inclined to keep its target rate low. That kind of reaction would simply re-enforce the deflationary expectations and lead to many years of deflation.\nWhile this scenario is conceivable, I consider it to be a highly unlikely one. The FOMC and the Board of Governors have displayed exactly the required unconventionality in solving many seemingly intractable problems over the past three years. I am confident that the Federal Reserve will display that same attribute if this deflationary challenge should ever arise. I am sure too that households and financial markets will share my confidence—which would actually eliminate the need for the Fed to ever confront hardened deflationary expectations.\nSo I’ve talked about a lot of issues today, and I could certainly talk about a lot more. But I have a feeling that you’ve got plenty of questions, and we are likely to hit on many key topics. So I will stop here and happily take your questions.\nThank you once again for this opportunity.\n1 I use the following procedure to reach these conclusions. I calibrated parameters in Shimer’s (2007) mismatch model to fit the average job openings rate from December 2000 to December 2007 and the average unemployment rate over the same period. I obtained m = 210.5 and n = 205.5 to fit an average unemployment rate of 5.2 percent and an average vacancy rate of 2.9 percent. (The calibrated parameters differ from Shimer’s own because of data revisions by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.) In June 2008, the unemployment rate was 5.5 percent and the vacancy rate was 2.7 percent; the model implied an unemployment rate of 5.5 percent and a vacancy rate of 2.6 percent if I set n = 204.2. In June 2010, the vacancy rate was 2.2 percent. I set n = 201.8 to match that in the model. At that value of n, the model implied an unemployment rate of 6.3 percent. The value of m in Shimer’s model has changed greatly.\n2 See Shimer and Werning (2008) and Clement (2006).\nReferences\nClement, Douglas. 2006. “If You Lost Your Job.” Region 20 (June), 34-37, 50-53.\nShimer, Robert. 2007. “Mismatch.” American Economic Review 97 (September), 1074-1101.\nShimer, Robert, and Iván Werning. 2008. “Liquidity and Insurance for the Unemployed.” American Economic Review 98 (December), 1922-42.\n\nThanks for the generous introduction. I’m delighted to have this opportunity to speak with you today. This is my first trip to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and I look forward to many more. I want to take this opportunity to thank Bob Jacquart, who was instrumental in helping us set up this meeting. Bob served on one of our economic advisory councils a few years ago, and I know that others in this room have served on such councils or on our bank’s board of directors. Thanks to all of you for that service. Thanks also to Dr. Les Wong and the UP CEOs for their role in making this event happen, and especially to Theresa Nease and others here at Northern Michigan University for their hospitality.\n\nOne of the benefits of these trips is that I get to hear how the economy is doing on the ground level, if you will. As you might imagine, we have a lot of data at our fingertips at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, but sometimes statistics don’t tell the whole story. On that note, I’m especially looking forward to the question-and-answer session following my talk. I’ve learned much from the questions at my various speaking engagements and expect that I’ll do the same today.\n\nAs you just heard, I became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis last October. Here’s the start of a rather typical conversation that I would have had with my friends and relatives last fall. “Congratulations! That’s fantastic. Now, what is it that you will do exactly?”\n\nAs it turns out, the job has a lot of interesting aspects. But I think I’ve been invited to speak here today because I help formulate monetary policy for the United States. So what I plan to do is give you some feel for how this part of my job works. In doing so, I’ll highlight the Federal Reserve’s quintessentially American structure. Unlike the central banks of other countries, you’ll see that ours is specifically designed to draw upon the insights of small town businesses, farmers and ranchers, and large manufacturers, among others, to formulate monetary policy. Before I proceed, I must remind you that any views I express here today are my own, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhat do I mean by an American structure? Well, relative to its counterparts around the world, the U.S. central bank is highly decentralized. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is one of 12 regional Reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. Our bank represents the ninth of the 12 Federal Reserve districts. The Ninth District is, by area, the second largest. It includes Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\n\nEight times per year, the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—meets to set the path of short-term interest rates over the next six to seven weeks. All 12 presidents of the various regional Federal Reserve banks—including me—and the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board contribute to these deliberations. (Actually, right now, there are only five governors—two positions are unfilled, and we’re scheduled to go down to four by the end of the month. The good news is that the White House has nominated three excellent candidates for the three vacancies.) However, the committee itself consists only of the governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and a rotating group of four other presidents (currently Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Boston). I’ll be on the committee in 2011.\n\nIn this way, the structure of the FOMC mirrors the federalist structure of our government. Representatives from different regions of the country—the various presidents—have input into FOMC deliberations. The input from the presidents relies critically on information they receive from their districts about local economic performance. We obtain this information through the work of our research staffs—but we also obtain it from business leaders in industries and towns, in my case, across the Upper Midwest. The Federal Reserve System is deliberately designed so that the residents of Main Street are able to have a voice in monetary policy.\n\nSo how, exactly, do the FOMC meetings work? In the remainder of my remarks, I’ll take you inside an FOMC meeting. Its structure provides a perfect vehicle to communicate the key considerations confronting monetary policymakers in the United States today.\n\nThe typical FOMC meeting features two so-called go-rounds, in which every president and every governor has a chance to speak without interruption. The first go-round is referred to as the economics go-round. The meeting participants describe their views on current economic conditions and their outlook for future economic conditions. The presidents’ remarks will typically include references to their own local economies, as well as the national and global situation.\n\nAs part of my contributions to the economics go-round in August, I discussed my outlook for gross domestic product (GDP), inflation, and unemployment. In terms of GDP, I believe that a modest recovery is under way and is likely to continue. In terms of inflation, I expect a slight but welcome uptick over the next 18 months. Finally, in terms of unemployment, I see current and future problems in labor markets that are likely to continue to prove resistant to the tools of monetary policy.\n\nI’ll talk first about GDP. Real GDP growth has been positive in each of the past four quarters, and the government’s initial estimate is that GDP grew at an annualized rate of 2.4 percent in the second quarter of this year. Based on estimates from our Minneapolis forecasting model, I expect GDP growth to be around 2.5 percent in the second half of 2010 and close to 3.0 percent in 2011. There is a recovery under way in the United States, and I expect it to continue.\n\nAs last week’s FOMC statement says, though, the pace of the recovery is more modest than I would have anticipated. We are four quarters into the recovery, and real GDP per person is still about 3.2 percent below its level in the fourth quarter of 2007 when the recession began. In some sense, this number actually understates the economic problem. Typically, real GDP per person grows between 1.5 and 2 percent per year. If the economy had actually grown at that rate over the past two and a half years, we would have between 7 and 8.2 percent more output per person than we do right now. My forecast is such that we will not make up that 7-8.2 percent lost output anytime soon.\n\nLet me turn now to inflation. From the fourth quarter of 2009 through the second quarter of 2010, the change in the PCE (personal consumption expenditures) price level was just over 0.5 percent, which works out to an annual rate of just over 1 percent. The Fed’s price stability mandate is generally interpreted as maintaining an inflation rate of 2 percent, and 1 percent inflation is often considered to be too low relative to this stricture. I expect it to remain at about this level during the rest of this year. However, our Minneapolis forecasting model predicts that it will rise back into the more desirable 1.5-2 percent range in 2011.\n\nSo the news about inflation and GDP is in the “good, but certainly could be better” category. However, the lack of vitality in the U.S. labor market can only be termed disturbing. The national unemployment rate remains at 9.5 percent in July. Private sector job creation remains weak—only 71,000 net private sector jobs were created in July.\n\nIf one digs deeper into the data, the situation seems even more troubling. Since December 2000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been keeping data on the job openings rate, which is defined as the number of job openings divided by the sum of job openings and employment. Not surprisingly, when job openings rise, the unemployed can find jobs more readily, and the unemployment rate typically falls. The inverse relationship between unemployment and job openings was extremely stable throughout the 2000-01 recession, the subsequent recovery, and on through the early part of this recession.\n\nBeginning in June 2008, this stable relationship began to break down, as the unemployment rate rose much faster than could be rationalized by the fall in the job openings rate. Over the past year, the relationship has completely shattered. The job openings rate has risen by about 20 percent between July 2009 and June 2010. Under this scenario, we would expect unemployment to fall because people find it easier to get jobs. However, the unemployment rate actually went up slightly over this period.\n\nWhat does this change in the relationship between job openings and unemployment connote? In a word, mismatch. Firms have jobs, but can’t find appropriate workers. The workers want to work, but can’t find appropriate jobs. There are many possible sources of mismatch—geography, skills, demography—and they are probably all at work. Whatever the source, though, it is hard to see how the Fed can do much to cure this problem. Monetary stimulus has provided conditions so that manufacturing plants want to hire new workers. But the Fed does not have a means to transform construction workers into manufacturing workers.\n\nOf course, the key question is: How much of the current unemployment rate is really due to mismatch, as opposed to conditions that the Fed can readily ameliorate? The answer seems to be a lot. I mentioned that the relationship between unemployment and job openings was stable from December 2000 through June 2008. Were that stable relationship still in place today, and given the current job opening rate of 2.2 percent, we would have an unemployment rate of closer to 6.5 percent, not 9.5 percent. Most of the existing unemployment represents mismatch that is not readily amenable to monetary policy.1\n\nGiven the structural problems in the labor market, I do not expect unemployment to decline rapidly. My own prediction is that unemployment will remain above 8 percent into 2012. Persistently high unemployment of this kind will impose considerable losses on many of our citizens. Good public policy requires that we help mitigate their losses via a well-designed unemployment insurance program. Recent economic research, including some done at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, shows that such a program will not feature the termination of benefits after 26, 52, or 99 weeks. Instead, a good insurance program should offer constant benefits over the entire duration of an unemployment spell, however long. It should provide incentives only through the level of those benefits, not through their timing.2\n\nThat was essentially my input about the national economy in the economics go-round of the FOMC last week. GDP is growing, but more slowly than we would like. Inflation is a little low, but only temporarily. The behavior of unemployment is deeply troubling.\n\nAfter the economics go-round, the FOMC meeting then transitions to its second phase, the policy go-round. Again, the 17 meeting participants have a chance to speak in turn about what they perceive to be the appropriate policy choices for the committee. We are all committed to achieving the Fed’s dual mandate to attain both price stability and maximum employment. As I mentioned, the former objective is generally understood as keeping inflation in a tight range around 2 percent. The second part of the mandate is much more of a moving target. Everyone knows that employment is shaped by many determinants beyond the Fed’s control: demographics, social custom, taxes, and so on. The Fed’s job is to keep employment as high as possible, given these other factors.\n\nRight now, the committee has to think about two quite distinct policy tools: short-term interest rates and balance sheet management. I’ll talk about both in turn.\n\nThe federal funds rate—the key short-term interest rate set by the FOMC—has been set at 0-25 basis points for over 18 months. In terms of its future level, the FOMC’s statement last week contains the following key sentence:\n\n“The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.”\n\nWhat do we learn from this rather long sentence? As you would hope, there is an intimate connection between my economic summary and what’s in this statement. The unemployment rate is 9.5 percent, and measured inflation is low (below 2 percent). Market and survey measures of expected inflation are also low (also below 2 percent).

Nonetheless, my remarks will focus on the lessons of the crisis for financial regulation. In doing so, I’m continuing an institutional tradition. My predecessor, Gary Stern, and my current head of supervision, Ron Feldman, literally wrote the book on how to deal with “Too Big to Fail” in 2004. Long before that, while working at the Minneapolis Fed, John Kareken and Neil Wallace sounded the alarm about the moral hazard generated by deposit insurance. This institutional history makes it especially important that I emphasize that any views I share today are my own, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nMy own thinking about financial regulation begins with what I see as the inevitability of collective mistakes. In the mid-2000s, we—as American investors, home owners, and bank lenders—collectively bet that house prices would not fall by 30 percent in most major metropolitan areas in three years. We were wrong. This mismatch between our expectations and our realizations was the ultimate source of the financial crisis of 2007-09.\nMy view is that no law can completely eliminate the kinds of collective investor and regulator mistakes that lead to financial crises. These mistakes have taken place periodically for centuries. They will certainly do so again. And once these crises happen, there are strong economic forces that lead policymakers—for the best of reasons—to bail out financial firms. In other words, no legislation can completely eliminate bailouts.\nMy theme today is that, even though they are inevitable, the likelihood and the magnitude of financial crises and bailouts can be limited by taxes on financial institutions. I arrive at this conclusion about the usefulness of taxes by thinking through an analogy that I’ll develop at some length. I will argue that, knowing bailouts are inevitable, financial institutions fail to internalize all the risks that their investment decisions impose on society. Economists would say that bailouts thereby create a risk “externality.” There is nearly a century of economic thought about how to deal with externalities of various sorts—and the usual answer is through taxation.  Taxes are a good response because they create incentives for firms to internalize the costs that would otherwise be external. \nI will emphasize the desirable incentive effects of taxes.  Much of the dialog about taxes on financial institutions emphasizes revenue collection goals. I will argue that correcting incentives and generating revenue are largely separate objectives. The United States could design a tax system with the right incentives and collect $5 billion per year from financial institutions. On the other hand, Canada could design a tax system with the right incentives and collect no revenue from financial institutions. Countries could well differ on their revenue collection objectives. But all should be interested in getting incentives in place to deter excessive risk-taking by financial institutions.\nMany policymakers are advocating taxation as a key instrument of financial regulation. Sweden has implemented a bank tax. The United Kingdom, France, and Germany seem likely to follow.  In the United States, the Obama administration has recommended the adoption of a levy on large financial institutions. The International Monetary Fund recently released a staff report that recommends a global tax on the financial sector.\nIn its June 27, 2010 communiqué, the G-20 agreed that countries should finance the response to financial crises through policies that accomplish five goals:\nProtect taxpayers\nReduce the risks from the financial sector\nProtect the flow of credit in good times and bad\nTake into account individual countries’ circumstances and options\nHelp promote a level playing field.\nThe G-20 made no specific recommendation about how to achieve these goals. But I hope to convince you that taxation is the best way to meet all five objectives.\nMy remarks today will overlap with those that I gave in Minneapolis on May 10.1 I build on the previous speech in two ways. First, I spend more time explaining the advantages of taxes over other regulatory responses. Second, while I discuss my preferred ideal tax system, I also describe some essential features for any desirable tax system.\nInevitability of Bailouts\nI began by saying that bailouts of financial institutions are certain to occur in financial crises. Why do I say this? There are many forces at play, but I believe that the strongest has to do with the very nature of financial intermediation. Investors in financial institutions always want the ability to pull their funds out quickly. For this reason, financial institutions’ liabilities often take the form of short-term debt and deposits. But short-term financing instruments are intrinsically prone to self-fulfilling crises of confidence commonly referred to as “runs.”\nImagine that Bank X needs $100 billion of one-day loans to survive. This means that for a given lender to be willing to make a $1 billion, one-day loan to Bank X, that lender has to believe that Bank X will get another $99 billion in one-day loans. Then, Bank X may fail simply because every possible lender believes correctly that no lender is willing to lend to Bank X. Such a crisis of confidence can occur regardless of the true condition of Bank X.\nThis story is hardly a new one. It’s exactly why we have deposit insurance: to prevent runs by reassuring short-term bank depositors that their money is safe. But the story has huge consequences for how governments operate. In a financial crisis, there is a tremendous sense of uncertainty. There are some truly insolvent financial firms out there—but no one knows for sure which ones are insolvent and which are sound. And during a crisis, the panic in the air means that any institution—even one with solid fundamentals—may be subjected to a run if its investors lose confidence in its solvency.\nIn such an atmosphere, contagion effects become extremely powerful. Even a slight loss by one short-term creditor can lead all short-term lenders to rush to the safety of Treasury bills. Such flight would endanger the survival of key financial institutions, even if they are fundamentally sound. Governments cannot risk systemic collapse, and so during times of crisis, they end up providing debt guarantees for financial institutions. Thus, policymakers inevitably resort to bailouts even when they have explicitly resolved, in the strongest possible terms, to let firms fail.\nMany observers have emphasized the need for better resolution mechanisms as part of financial regulatory reform. Different people mean different things by this, but most want to impose losses on debt holders. I’m not opposed to faster and better resolution of bankruptcies. But I do not believe that better resolution mechanisms will end bailouts. Indeed, I’m led to make a prediction. No matter what mechanisms we legislate now to impose losses on creditors, Congress, or some agency acting on Congress’ behalf, will block those mechanisms when we next face a financial crisis. And Congress will do so for a very good reason: to forestall a run on the key players in the financial system and thereby prevent system-wide collapse.\nInvestment Inefficiencies\nSo, that’s my first point: Bailouts are inevitable during financial crises. Let me move to the second: Anticipation of bailouts creates inefficiency in the allocation of real investment. Here’s what I mean. Financial institutions make investments that are, by their very nature, risky—that is, their returns are not certain. They finance these investments, at least in part, using debt and deposits.\nNow, imagine for a moment that we live in a world without bailouts, so that the government does not provide debt guarantees or deposit insurance. In such a world, if a financial institution decided to increase the risk level of its investment portfolio, its debt holders and depositors would face a greater risk of loss. By way of compensation for that greater risk, they’d demand a higher yield. As a result, in the absence of government guarantees, financial institutions would find it more costly to obtain debt financing for highly risky investments than for less risky ones. This effect, on the margin, would curb a firm’s appetite for risk. It would have an especially powerful effect on highly leveraged financial institutions, because high debt-to-asset levels mean higher risk of being unable to fulfill debt obligations.\nBut now return to the real world, with deposit insurance and debt guarantees, and the inevitability of government bailouts. Even if they only kick in during financial crises, these guarantees change the natural market relationship between risk and cost. Depositors and debt holders are now partially insulated from increases in investment risk, and so they do not demand a sufficiently high yield from riskier firms. Financial institutions take on too much risk, because they are no longer deterred from doing so by the high cost of debt finance. And this missing deterrence is especially relevant for firms that are highly leveraged, because they should be paying out especially high yields on their debts.\nIn this way, the expectation of bailouts leads to too much capital being allocated toward overly risky ventures. These misallocations of capital don’t create the collective mistakes in predictions that generate financial crises. But the misallocations do mean that society loses a lot from those mistakes—a lot more than is efficient.\nRegulatory Responses\nThere are a number of regulatory responses that would help mitigate the misallocation problem just described. In its June 27 communiqué, the G-20 put special emphasis on enhancing capital and liquidity requirements. Both would deter risk-taking by financial institutions. However, it is important to understand and consider the costs that they impose on an economy.\nLet me talk first about capital. High capital requirements are designed to reduce the amount of debt issued by a financial institution. With less debt, there are fewer failing firms that policymakers must bail out during financial crises. With lowered needs for government debt guarantees, there is less inefficiency. Consider the extreme situation of a financial institution that is financed only by equity, and not by debt or deposits. Such an institution would never get any bailouts from the government, and so would not engage in excessive risk-taking.\nHowever, financial economists have long recognized that debt has important benefits. Outside investors are typically not as well-informed about firm attributes as decision makers inside a firm. In this context, debt—and the associated threat of bankruptcy—helps discipline firm insiders. For example, one essential feature of equity is that a firm can vary its dividend payments to investors. But this very flexibility allows managers and other firm insiders more freedom to divert firm income to themselves and away from outside investors. Having to repay debt imposes much sharper constraints on managers—a discipline that both equity holders and debt holders value. As a result, firms that use a mix of debt and equity should be able to raise more outside funds for a given investment opportunity than firms that use equity alone.\nThe above argument applies to all kinds of debt. (In passing, the argument depends on the firm’s debt only being guaranteed during financial crises. Perfectly guaranteed debt holders, such as depositors, will impose no discipline on managers.) However, short-term debt is especially relevant. Suppose outside investors learn that a firm’s managerial team has been making poor choices. In this context, equity holders and long-term debt holders cannot retrieve their investments without finding some other firm outsider to buy them. In contrast, short-term debt holders and depositors have the ability to withdraw their entire investment from the firm without using sales.\nTo sum up: It is true that debt—especially short-term debt—increases the size of government transfers that a given firm will potentially receive during a financial panic. From that point of view, restrictions on debt issuance are attractive. At the same time, debt—especially short-term debt—helps align the incentives of managerial insiders and investing outsiders. Tougher capital standards will undercut this alignment, and inhibit economic growth.\nAnother potentially useful regulatory response emphasized in the G-20 communiqué is to require financial institutions to hold more liquid assets. Again, such a requirement would help reduce the need for government bailouts. Consider an extreme example. Suppose all financial institutions were required to hold cash equal in value to their deposits. There would be no need for deposit insurance, as depositors would always be sure that they could obtain their funds.\nSuch a regulation would obviously be inefficient, though. While it is certainly true that bank depositors have the right to retrieve their deposits within seconds, they rarely exercise that right. The typical dollar stays in a bank for many months before being withdrawn. This timing means that banks can safely invest deposits in longer-term, higher-yield investments. Indeed, many economists have identified this so-called “maturity transformation” of demandable deposits into long-term investments as being the defining feature of banks.\nSo there are benefits and costs associated with liquidity requirements, just as there are with capital requirements. Banks with more liquid asset holdings are certainly better protected against the possibility of runs, but they’re also performing less of the maturity transformation that improves capital allocation and economic efficiency. The right liquidity requirement for a given bank will depend critically on the nature of its investment opportunities, the fluctuations in the inflows and outflows of its deposits, and its ability to access short-term debt funding.\nAlong with capital and liquidity requirements, financial regulators have a host of other approaches at their disposal to curb excessive risk-taking. With this portfolio of possible instruments, it is important to find the right combination of regulations for financial firms. However, as we have discussed for capital and liquidity requirements, all regulations have private costs as well as social benefits. Because of these private costs, regulators cannot find the optimal mix of regulatory requirements for a firm without solving that firm’s cost minimization problem with respect to capital, liquidity and many other variables.\nTaxes\nIs there a different government response to excessive risk-taking that would allow regulators to avoid solving the cost minimization problems of financial firms? In what follows, I offer an analogy from a completely different arena of public policy that can help us think through this key question.\nConsider a factory that creates air pollution as a byproduct of operation. When the firm that owns the factory chooses to produce more output, it incurs various private costs: more raw materials, more labor, and so on. But the production increase also generates more pollution that will be absorbed by the surrounding community. The pollution is a social cost of production not paid for, or “internalized,” by the firm that generates it. Economists refer to such costs as “externalities.”\nThis same distinction between private and social costs applies to financial institutions that enjoy debt guarantees. Such guarantees imply that some portion of the risk produced by a firm’s investment decisions is absorbed by taxpayers. In making decisions about what to invest in, the firm ignores that portion of risk. It is a social cost of the project that the private firm does not internalize. Just like the pollution, the risk borne by taxpayers is an externality—what I will call a “risk externality.”\nThis analogy is useful because economists know a lot about how to deal with externalities. We can exploit their years of research to address the problem of financial regulation when government bailouts are inevitable. In particular, that long history of thought says that the best way to correct externalities is by providing the right kinds of incentives through appropriate taxes.\nLet me be more specific. Again, let’s think about the firm with a polluting factory. Many of its choices affect the amount of pollution generated, including the amount of time that the firm runs the factory during the workweek, the sorts of antipollution technology employed, and the kind of energy used to run the factory. Now, the government could regulate the firm’s pollution levels by controlling each and every one of these choices. However, to do so, the government has to choose how to trade off these three (and other) factors against one another.\nIts trade-off decisions will be influenced by both pollution considerations and cost factors. If antipollution technology is cheap, the government may simply require the firm to invest in that. But if antipollution technology is expensive, the government may require the firm to buy clean energy instead. Making these trade-offs requires a tremendous amount of firm-specific information and firm-specific cost minimization analysis. To put it mildly, historical evidence suggests that governments are not very good at such micromanagement of factory-level operation; that’s why we have private markets.\nThe solution to this difficulty is to regulate the amount of pollution generated by the firm, rather than how the firm creates it. The central problem here is that pollution has a social cost that the firm does not internalize when choosing its level of production. From society’s point of view, the firm will generate excessive pollution. However, the firm will create the socially efficient level of pollution if it is required to pay for—or internalize—its full social cost.\nMore concretely, suppose that the firm is told, before choosing its level of production, that the government will measure the amount of pollution that the firm generates and charge the firm a tax that is exactly equal to the social cost of that quantity of pollution. This policy generates a tax schedule that translates the amount of pollution generated into an amount paid by the firm. If the firm knows that it faces this tax schedule, its costs of production will include the social cost of pollution, along with the costs of labor, materials, energy, and the like. In this way, what was external to the firm becomes internal. As a result, the firm will choose the socially efficient level of pollution. Just as importantly, it will automatically choose to create that pollution—and the factory’s more beneficial outputs—in a cost-minimizing fashion. Governments do not need to solve the firm’s cost-minimization problem.\nLessons for Financial Regulation\nThese lessons about pollution regulation translate directly into lessons for financial regulation. As in the pollution case, a financial institution should be taxed for the amount of risk it creates that is borne by taxpayers. Once the firm faces the correct tax, it will choose to produce that risk with a cost-minimizing mix of capital, liquidity, incentive compensation and other factors. As in the pollution case, using taxes to discourage excessive risk saves the government from actually trying to solve the cost-minimization problem of financial firms.\nThis reasoning suggests the following idealized policy. The firm is told that the government will estimate the expected, discounted value of bailouts that the financial institution (or any of its stakeholders) will receive in the future. I say “expected” because the amount of the bailout is uncertain (and indeed is likely to be zero much of the time). I say “discounted” because the bailout may be received next year or in 30 years, and we need to discount accordingly. Getting the right discount rate is important. The bailouts will be large when the stock market and the economy are doing poorly. In the language of finance, the bailouts have a negative beta. It follows that the appropriate discount rate should be less—and possibly substantially less—than the rate of return on Treasuries.\nClearly, this estimate will depend on many firm choices and attributes, including its leverage ratio, the maturity structure of its liabilities, the risk characteristics of its investment portfolio, its incentive compensation schemes, and its involvement in the payment system. For example, the expected bailout will be higher for firms with highly risky investments than for firms with less risky portfolios.\nHaving done this calculation, the government then charges the firm a tax that is exactly equal to the expected discounted value of the firm’s bailouts. Just as in the pollution example, this measurement-plus-taxation policy confronts the firm with a tax schedule that translates its choices into a cost paid by the firm. The tax amount exactly equals the extra cost borne by the taxpayers because of bailouts, appropriately adjusted for risk and the time value of money. Knowing that it faces this tax schedule, the firm no longer has an incentive to undertake inefficiently risky investments. Its investment choices will be socially efficient. It is useful to tax a financial institution producing a risk externality, just as it is useful to tax a firm generating a pollution externality. The purpose of the tax in both instances is to ensure that the targeted firm pays the full costs—private and social—of its production decisions.\nMy proposed tax creates the right kinds of incentives for risk-taking. As I mentioned in the introduction, these incentives are distinct from revenue objectives. The risk tax will raise some amount of revenue. Governments wishing to collect more revenue from the financial sector can impose an additional one-time levy on financial institutions that is not risk-based. Other governments may want to collect less revenue from the financial sector. In that case, they can transfer back some of the risk tax collections. These transfers need to be structured so that they do not undo the incentives in the risk tax itself. For example, they could simply be spread evenly across all financial institutions.\nA risk tax does require bank supervisors to calculate the expected present value of future bailout payments. These calculations are likely to be complex in a number of ways. Moreover, the calculations could well be controversial. Financial institutions that follow highly risky strategies get especially high profits when those strategies are working. Thus, supervisors would be required to levy high risk taxes on exactly those institutions that appear to be extremely successful. To address these issues of complexity and controversy, it would be of great value to develop an objective way—with the use of market information— to compute the required tax.\nHere’s what I have in mind. Suppose that, for every relevant financial institution, the government issues a “rescue bond.”  The rescue bond pays a variable coupon equal to 1/1,000 of the transfers made from the taxpayer to the institution or its stakeholders. (I pick 1/1,000 out of the air; any fixed fraction will do.) Much of the time, this coupon will be zero, because bailouts aren’t necessary and so the firm will not receive transfers. However, just like the institution’s stakeholders, the owners of the rescue bond will occasionally receive a large payment. In a well-functioning market, the price of this bond is exactly equal to the 1/1,000 of the expected discounted value of the transfers to the firm and its stakeholders. Thus, the government should charge the financial firm a tax equal to 1,000 times the price of the bond. Note that the “rescue” bond is only a measurement device. In particular, it is not part of the financial firm’s rescue. \nNotice that this approach could be used for a wide variety of financial institutions, including nonbanks. In principle, the government need not figure out in advance exactly which are systemically important and which are not. Instead, it could simply issue a rescue bond for every institution. Then the market itself could reveal how systemically important each institution is through the price of its rescue bonds. Of course, markets are not always perfect. It may not always be appropriate to rely only on market measures to compute the appropriate taxes. However, even in these cases, the prices of rescue bonds would contain valuable information that should be an important input into the supervisory process.\nGeneral Rules for Implementation\nIn describing the above tax system, I’ve glossed over a variety of political and administrative realities. In this sense, I would have to say that my tax system should be viewed as an ideal. Nonetheless, like all economic ideals, I believe that it suggests general rules that can be used to discipline the construction of any tax on financial institution risk.\nThe first rule is that a useful tax on risk must take into account the existence of deposit insurance. Deposit insurance means that deposit rates of return are independent of the underlying risk in bank assets. Like any debt guarantee, it incentivizes excessive risk-taking by financial institutions. A good tax must undo these incentives.\nIn many countries, banks pay risk-based deposit insurance premia. If levied on top of an explicit risk tax, these premia create the possibility of inefficient double taxation. However, it is straightforward to design a tax system that avoids this possibility. First, calculate the overall tax on risk for the financial institution (based on its assets, liabilities and other attributes). Then, deduct whatever premium the bank is paying to the deposit insurer.\nAlternatively, it may be desirable to simply re-label what I’m terming a “bank tax” or “risk tax” as a “systemic insurance premium.” It could then be collected by a regulatory agency, as opposed to the Treasury.\nThe second rule is that risk taxes must always be collected. Many of the proposals for taxes on financial institutions (and the actual law in Sweden) put a cap on tax collections. Once that cap is reached, banks will no longer face taxes for taking on extra risk and will again have an incentive to engage in excessively risky investments.\nAs I indicated earlier, it’s important to keep revenue objectives separate from incentive correction. Some governments may find it desirable to stop collecting revenues from the financial sector after some point in time. They can readily do so while preserving the incentives of the risk tax system. My point is that those incentives must always be kept in place.\nThe third rule is that any tax on risk must incorporate market information. The goal of a tax on risk is to force financial institutions to internalize the costs that their investing decisions impose on taxpayers by virtue of government debt guarantees. These costs are forward-looking valuations of future risky cash flows. It is impossible to have accurate measures of the costs without market information about both the quantity and the price of risk embedded in these cash flows.\nRescue bonds provide one highly precise but perhaps impractical way to use market information. A cruder, possibly more practical approach would be to use measures from the ratings agencies. Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s each provide two distinct ratings for the debt of various financial institutions. One rating considers the financial institutions as they are, and the other considers the institutions in an imaginary world without government support. The difference between the two is termed “ratings uplift” and it can be substantial. In principle, a regulator can translate these uplifts into differences in debt yields, and thereby into measures of implicit government subsidies.\nConclusions\nLet me close with some final thoughts about capital. As I stated earlier, the June 27 G-20 communiqué emphasizes the role of capital requirements in forging a new regulatory structure. The communiqué suggests that banks be required to hold enough capital “to withstand … stresses of a magnitude that they experienced during the recent financial crisis” without government support. This response strikes me as being problematic in a couple of ways. \nFirst, good financial regulations should take into account the probability and timing of various possible outcomes. The recent crisis is generally agreed to be the biggest of its kind since 1929. Should financial institutions be required to protect themselves fully against shocks that take place just once in eighty years? This kind of extreme risk aversion in regulatory design seems likely to create an undue drag on economic growth.\nParadoxically, the G-20’s capital requirement proposal also strikes me as too weak. The magnitude of our recent financial crisis was created in part by the investment decisions of leading global financial institutions. These institutions have the ability to generate even bigger shocks and their creditors would be likely to receive even more substantial government transfers in that event. Good regulation should deter them from creating the potential for adverse shocks bigger than those we have observed historically. The proposed capital standard does not.\nThus, capital is at once too strong a tool and too weak a tool. More generally, it seems to me that capital and liquidity requirements are intrinsically backwards-looking. We need forward-looking instruments for what is intrinsically a forward-looking problem. And that’s a key reason why taxes, based on market information, will work better.\nTo wrap up: Bailouts will inevitably happen during financial crises to prevent runs and systemic collapse. We need to structure financial regulation so as to limit the size and frequency of these bailouts. How should we best design such regulations? The social distortion we face is that debt guarantees create a risk externality, because financial institutions do not bear the full costs of their investment choices. Financial regulation should be designed to best control that externality. Capital and liquidity requirements may be helpful, but they are likely to create inefficient drags on growth.\nInstead, as is true with any externality, the risk externality can be eliminated with a well-designed tax system. I’ve suggested some properties for a good tax system. In particular, I believe that any such tax should embed appropriate information from financial markets.\n1 Kocherlakota, Narayana R. 2010. “Taxing Risk.” Comments at the Economic Club of Minnesota (May 10): Minneapolis, Minn. Full text [pdf]  |  Video [off-site]\n\nThe title of this workshop is: “Lessons from the Recent Crisis for Monetary Policy and Financial Regulation.” I suspect that I’m on this conference program because I am a monetary policymaker. Nonetheless, my remarks will focus on the lessons of the crisis for financial regulation. In doing so, I’m continuing an institutional tradition. My predecessor, Gary Stern, and my current head of supervision, Ron Feldman, literally wrote the book on how to deal with “Too Big to Fail” in 2004. Long before that, while working at the Minneapolis Fed, John Kareken and Neil Wallace sounded the alarm about the moral hazard generated by deposit insurance. This institutional history makes it especially important that I emphasize that any views I share today are my own, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nMy own thinking about financial regulation begins with what I see as the inevitability of collective mistakes. In the mid-2000s, we—as American investors, home owners, and bank lenders—collectively bet that house prices would not fall by 30 percent in most major metropolitan areas in three years. We were wrong. This mismatch between our expectations and our realizations was the ultimate source of the financial crisis of 2007-09.\n\nMy view is that no law can completely eliminate the kinds of collective investor and regulator mistakes that lead to financial crises. These mistakes have taken place periodically for centuries. They will certainly do so again. And once these crises happen, there are strong economic forces that lead policymakers—for the best of reasons—to bail out financial firms. In other words, no legislation can completely eliminate bailouts.\n\nMy theme today is that, even though they are inevitable, the likelihood and the magnitude of financial crises and bailouts can be limited by taxes on financial institutions. I arrive at this conclusion about the usefulness of taxes by thinking through an analogy that I’ll develop at some length. I will argue that, knowing bailouts are inevitable, financial institutions fail to internalize all the risks that their investment decisions impose on society. Economists would say that bailouts thereby create a risk “externality.” There is nearly a century of economic thought about how to deal with externalities of various sorts—and the usual answer is through taxation.  Taxes are a good response because they create incentives for firms to internalize the costs that would otherwise be external.\n\nI will emphasize the desirable incentive effects of taxes.  Much of the dialog about taxes on financial institutions emphasizes revenue collection goals. I will argue that correcting incentives and generating revenue are largely separate objectives. The United States could design a tax system with the right incentives and collect $5 billion per year from financial institutions. On the other hand, Canada could design a tax system with the right incentives and collect no revenue from financial institutions. Countries could well differ on their revenue collection objectives. But all should be interested in getting incentives in place to deter excessive risk-taking by financial institutions.\n\nMany policymakers are advocating taxation as a key instrument of financial regulation.

However, short-term debt is especially relevant. Suppose outside investors learn that a firm’s managerial team has been making poor choices. In this context, equity holders and long-term debt holders cannot retrieve their investments without finding some other firm outsider to buy them. In contrast, short-term debt holders and depositors have the ability to withdraw their entire investment from the firm without using sales.\n\nTo sum up: It is true that debt—especially short-term debt—increases the size of government transfers that a given firm will potentially receive during a financial panic. From that point of view, restrictions on debt issuance are attractive. At the same time, debt—especially short-term debt—helps align the incentives of managerial insiders and investing outsiders. Tougher capital standards will undercut this alignment, and inhibit economic growth.\n\nAnother potentially useful regulatory response emphasized in the G-20 communiqué is to require financial institutions to hold more liquid assets. Again, such a requirement would help reduce the need for government bailouts. Consider an extreme example. Suppose all financial institutions were required to hold cash equal in value to their deposits. There would be no need for deposit insurance, as depositors would always be sure that they could obtain their funds.\n\nSuch a regulation would obviously be inefficient, though. While it is certainly true that bank depositors have the right to retrieve their deposits within seconds, they rarely exercise that right. The typical dollar stays in a bank for many months before being withdrawn. This timing means that banks can safely invest deposits in longer-term, higher-yield investments. Indeed, many economists have identified this so-called “maturity transformation” of demandable deposits into long-term investments as being the defining feature of banks.\n\nSo there are benefits and costs associated with liquidity requirements, just as there are with capital requirements. Banks with more liquid asset holdings are certainly better protected against the possibility of runs, but they’re also performing less of the maturity transformation that improves capital allocation and economic efficiency. The right liquidity requirement for a given bank will depend critically on the nature of its investment opportunities, the fluctuations in the inflows and outflows of its deposits, and its ability to access short-term debt funding.\n\nAlong with capital and liquidity requirements, financial regulators have a host of other approaches at their disposal to curb excessive risk-taking. With this portfolio of possible instruments, it is important to find the right combination of regulations for financial firms. However, as we have discussed for capital and liquidity requirements, all regulations have private costs as well as social benefits. Because of these private costs, regulators cannot find the optimal mix of regulatory requirements for a firm without solving that firm’s cost minimization problem with respect to capital, liquidity and many other variables.\n\nIs there a different government response to excessive risk-taking that would allow regulators to avoid solving the cost minimization problems of financial firms? In what follows, I offer an analogy from a completely different arena of public policy that can help us think through this key question.\n\nConsider a factory that creates air pollution as a byproduct of operation. When the firm that owns the factory chooses to produce more output, it incurs various private costs: more raw materials, more labor, and so on. But the production increase also generates more pollution that will be absorbed by the surrounding community. The pollution is a social cost of production not paid for, or “internalized,” by the firm that generates it. Economists refer to such costs as “externalities.”\n\nThis same distinction between private and social costs applies to financial institutions that enjoy debt guarantees. Such guarantees imply that some portion of the risk produced by a firm’s investment decisions is absorbed by taxpayers. In making decisions about what to invest in, the firm ignores that portion of risk. It is a social cost of the project that the private firm does not internalize. Just like the pollution, the risk borne by taxpayers is an externality—what I will call a “risk externality.”\n\nThis analogy is useful because economists know a lot about how to deal with externalities. We can exploit their years of research to address the problem of financial regulation when government bailouts are inevitable. In particular, that long history of thought says that the best way to correct externalities is by providing the right kinds of incentives through appropriate taxes.\n\nLet me be more specific. Again, let’s think about the firm with a polluting factory. Many of its choices affect the amount of pollution generated, including the amount of time that the firm runs the factory during the workweek, the sorts of antipollution technology employed, and the kind of energy used to run the factory. Now, the government could regulate the firm’s pollution levels by controlling each and every one of these choices. However, to do so, the government has to choose how to trade off these three (and other) factors against one another.\n\nIts trade-off decisions will be influenced by both pollution considerations and cost factors. If antipollution technology is cheap, the government may simply require the firm to invest in that. But if antipollution technology is expensive, the government may require the firm to buy clean energy instead. Making these trade-offs requires a tremendous amount of firm-specific information and firm-specific cost minimization analysis. To put it mildly, historical evidence suggests that governments are not very good at such micromanagement of factory-level operation; that’s why we have private markets.\n\nThe solution to this difficulty is to regulate the amount of pollution generated by the firm, rather than how the firm creates it. The central problem here is that pollution has a social cost that the firm does not internalize when choosing its level of production. From society’s point of view, the firm will generate excessive pollution. However, the firm will create the socially efficient level of pollution if it is required to pay for—or internalize—its full social cost.\n\nMore concretely, suppose that the firm is told, before choosing its level of production, that the government will measure the amount of pollution that the firm generates and charge the firm a tax that is exactly equal to the social cost of that quantity of pollution. This policy generates a tax schedule that translates the amount of pollution generated into an amount paid by the firm. If the firm knows that it faces this tax schedule, its costs of production will include the social cost of pollution, along with the costs of labor, materials, energy, and the like. In this way, what was external to the firm becomes internal. As a result, the firm will choose the socially efficient level of pollution. Just as importantly, it will automatically choose to create that pollution—and the factory’s more beneficial outputs—in a cost-minimizing fashion. Governments do not need to solve the firm’s cost-minimization problem.\n\nThese lessons about pollution regulation translate directly into lessons for financial regulation. As in the pollution case, a financial institution should be taxed for the amount of risk it creates that is borne by taxpayers. Once the firm faces the correct tax, it will choose to produce that risk with a cost-minimizing mix of capital, liquidity, incentive compensation and other factors. As in the pollution case, using taxes to discourage excessive risk saves the government from actually trying to solve the cost-minimization problem of financial firms.\n\nThis reasoning suggests the following idealized policy. The firm is told that the government will estimate the expected, discounted value of bailouts that the financial institution (or any of its stakeholders) will receive in the future. I say “expected” because the amount of the bailout is uncertain (and indeed is likely to be zero much of the time). I say “discounted” because the bailout may be received next year or in 30 years, and we need to discount accordingly. Getting the right discount rate is important. The bailouts will be large when the stock market and the economy are doing poorly. In the language of finance, the bailouts have a negative beta. It follows that the appropriate discount rate should be less—and possibly substantially less—than the rate of return on Treasuries.\n\nClearly, this estimate will depend on many firm choices and attributes, including its leverage ratio, the maturity structure of its liabilities, the risk characteristics of its investment portfolio, its incentive compensation schemes, and its involvement in the payment system. For example, the expected bailout will be higher for firms with highly risky investments than for firms with less risky portfolios.\n\nHaving done this calculation, the government then charges the firm a tax that is exactly equal to the expected discounted value of the firm’s bailouts. Just as in the pollution example, this measurement-plus-taxation policy confronts the firm with a tax schedule that translates its choices into a cost paid by the firm. The tax amount exactly equals the extra cost borne by the taxpayers because of bailouts, appropriately adjusted for risk and the time value of money. Knowing that it faces this tax schedule, the firm no longer has an incentive to undertake inefficiently risky investments. Its investment choices will be socially efficient. It is useful to tax a financial institution producing a risk externality, just as it is useful to tax a firm generating a pollution externality. The purpose of the tax in both instances is to ensure that the targeted firm pays the full costs—private and social—of its production decisions.\n\nMy proposed tax creates the right kinds of incentives for risk-taking. As I mentioned in the introduction, these incentives are distinct from revenue objectives. The risk tax will raise some amount of revenue. Governments wishing to collect more revenue from the financial sector can impose an additional one-time levy on financial institutions that is not risk-based. Other governments may want to collect less revenue from the financial sector. In that case, they can transfer back some of the risk tax collections. These transfers need to be structured so that they do not undo the incentives in the risk tax itself. For example, they could simply be spread evenly across all financial institutions.\n\nA risk tax does require bank supervisors to calculate the expected present value of future bailout payments. These calculations are likely to be complex in a number of ways. Moreover, the calculations could well be controversial. Financial institutions that follow highly risky strategies get especially high profits when those strategies are working. Thus, supervisors would be required to levy high risk taxes on exactly those institutions that appear to be extremely successful. To address these issues of complexity and controversy, it would be of great value to develop an objective way—with the use of market information— to compute the required tax.\n\nHere’s what I have in mind. Suppose that, for every relevant financial institution, the government issues a “rescue bond.”  The rescue bond pays a variable coupon equal to 1/1,000 of the transfers made from the taxpayer to the institution or its stakeholders. (I pick 1/1,000 out of the air; any fixed fraction will do.) Much of the time, this coupon will be zero, because bailouts aren’t necessary and so the firm will not receive transfers. However, just like the institution’s stakeholders, the owners of the rescue bond will occasionally receive a large payment. In a well-functioning market, the price of this bond is exactly equal to the 1/1,000 of the expected discounted value of the transfers to the firm and its stakeholders. Thus, the government should charge the financial firm a tax equal to 1,000 times the price of the bond. Note that the “rescue” bond is only a measurement device. In particular, it is not part of the financial firm’s rescue.\n\nNotice that this approach could be used for a wide variety of financial institutions, including nonbanks. In principle, the government need not figure out in advance exactly which are systemically important and which are not. Instead, it could simply issue a rescue bond for every institution. Then the market itself could reveal how systemically important each institution is through the price of its rescue bonds. Of course, markets are not always perfect. It may not always be appropriate to rely only on market measures to compute the appropriate taxes. However, even in these cases, the prices of rescue bonds would contain valuable information that should be an important input into the supervisory process.\n\nIn describing the above tax system, I’ve glossed over a variety of political and administrative realities. In this sense, I would have to say that my tax system should be viewed as an ideal. Nonetheless, like all economic ideals, I believe that it suggests general rules that can be used to discipline the construction of any tax on financial institution risk.\n\nThe first rule is that a useful tax on risk must take into account the existence of deposit insurance. Deposit insurance means that deposit rates of return are independent of the underlying risk in bank assets. Like any debt guarantee, it incentivizes excessive risk-taking by financial institutions. A good tax must undo these incentives.\n\nIn many countries, banks pay risk-based deposit insurance premia. If levied on top of an explicit risk tax, these premia create the possibility of inefficient double taxation. However, it is straightforward to design a tax system that avoids this possibility. First, calculate the overall tax on risk for the financial institution (based on its assets, liabilities and other attributes). Then, deduct whatever premium the bank is paying to the deposit insurer.\n\nAlternatively, it may be desirable to simply re-label what I’m terming a “bank tax” or “risk tax” as a “systemic insurance premium.” It could then be collected by a regulatory agency, as opposed to the Treasury.\n\nThe second rule is that risk taxes must always be collected. Many of the proposals for taxes on financial institutions (and the actual law in Sweden) put a cap on tax collections. Once that cap is reached, banks will no longer face taxes for taking on extra risk and will again have an incentive to engage in excessively risky investments.\n\nAs I indicated earlier, it’s important to keep revenue objectives separate from incentive correction. Some governments may find it desirable to stop collecting revenues from the financial sector after some point in time. They can readily do so while preserving the incentives of the risk tax system. My point is that those incentives must always be kept in place.\n\nThe third rule is that any tax on risk must incorporate market information. The goal of a tax on risk is to force financial institutions to internalize the costs that their investing decisions impose on taxpayers by virtue of government debt guarantees. These costs are forward-looking valuations of future risky cash flows. It is impossible to have accurate measures of the costs without market information about both the quantity and the price of risk embedded in these cash flows.\n\nRescue bonds provide one highly precise but perhaps impractical way to use market information. A cruder, possibly more practical approach would be to use measures from the ratings agencies. Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s each provide two distinct ratings for the debt of various financial institutions. One rating considers the financial institutions as they are, and the other considers the institutions in an imaginary world without government support. The difference between the two is termed “ratings uplift” and it can be substantial. In principle, a regulator can translate these uplifts into differences in debt yields, and thereby into measures of implicit government subsidies.\n\nLet me close with some final thoughts about capital. As I stated earlier, the June 27 G-20 communiqué emphasizes the role of capital requirements in forging a new regulatory structure. The communiqué suggests that banks be required to hold enough capital “to withstand … stresses of a magnitude that they experienced during the recent financial crisis” without government support. This response strikes me as being problematic in a couple of ways.\n\nFirst, good financial regulations should take into account the probability and timing of various possible outcomes. The recent crisis is generally agreed to be the biggest of its kind since 1929. Should financial institutions be required to protect themselves fully against shocks that take place just once in eighty years? This kind of extreme risk aversion in regulatory design seems likely to create an undue drag on economic growth.\n\nParadoxically, the G-20’s capital requirement proposal also strikes me as too weak. The magnitude of our recent financial crisis was created in part by the investment decisions of leading global financial institutions. These institutions have the ability to generate even bigger shocks and their creditors would be likely to receive even more substantial government transfers in that event. Good regulation should deter them from creating the potential for adverse shocks bigger than those we have observed historically. The proposed capital standard does not.\n\nThus, capital is at once too strong a tool and too weak a tool. More generally, it seems to me that capital and liquidity requirements are intrinsically backwards-looking. We need forward-looking instruments for what is intrinsically a forward-looking problem. And that’s a key reason why taxes, based on market information, will work better.\n\nTo wrap up: Bailouts will inevitably happen during financial crises to prevent runs and systemic collapse. We need to structure financial regulation so as to limit the size and frequency of these bailouts. How should we best design such regulations? The social distortion we face is that debt guarantees create a risk externality, because financial institutions do not bear the full costs of their investment choices. Financial regulation should be designed to best control that externality. Capital and liquidity requirements may be helpful, but they are likely to create inefficient drags on growth.\n\nInstead, as is true with any externality, the risk externality can be eliminated with a well-designed tax system. I’ve suggested some properties for a good tax system. In particular, I believe that any such tax should embed appropriate information from financial markets."

            "content": "Congratulations! You have earned your college degree. Now, I’m sure that I’m not the first to congratulate you. Your parents have congratulated you. Your aunt and uncle have congratulated you. In fact, if you’re lucky, even your teen-age brother or sister has found the time in their busy lives to congratulate you.\nWhy does everyone congratulate you? I’m going to give you two answers to that question. The first is pretty uncontroversial, while the second is more so.\nI first want to talk about your college degree as a successful financial investment. My guess is that most of you have not done a lot of financial investing yet. When I was in college, I liked to put my spare money into pizza and not into stocks or bonds. (Pizza pays off—but in pounds not dollars. That’s a pun, and a great example of what economists call humor.) But, whether you realize it or not, going to college was an investment. Anytime you give up some money today in exchange for money in the future—well, that’s an investment. And making good investments is critical to being financially successful.\nEconomists rank investments by what we call investment returns—that is, what you get back per dollar invested. If you give up $100,000 and get back $8,000 per year forever—well, that’s a return of 8 percent per year. If you give up $200,000, and get back $8,000 per year forever—well, that’s a return of 4 percent per year. The second investment is not as good as the first (assuming that they have the same levels of risk). We can compare any two investments, no matter how different they seem, by comparing their returns.\nYour college education was a big investment. You—and your investment partners—gave up about $40,000 in tuition. But that’s just the beginning—you couldn’t work full time while in college, and so you lost out on four years of part-time wages. All told, my guess is that you gave up something on the order of $100,000.\nSo, the college education investment was a big one, in terms of what you put in. But you also will get something big out of that investment—higher wages upon graduation, and then higher wages for the rest of your working life. What is the expected return on investing in a college education—that is, what will you get back in terms of increased wages per dollar that you invested? Recent studies estimate that finishing college over high school delivers a return of somewhere between 8 percent and 10 percent per year.1 Is this a big number? Well, historically, the rate of return on the stock market is around 6-7 percent per year. So, by investing in a college education, you can beat the stock market! That’s especially true because the return to a college education is much less risky.\nThese numbers are pretty well-known. The real kicker is the value of a four-year degree over a two-year degree. You’ve received your degree at the University of Minnesota. You could’ve earned a two-year degree instead. But four years of post-high school education delivers a return of about 15-20 percent per year over two years of post-high school education. That’s over twice the return to the stock market.\nNow, there is a complicating factor to this somewhat rosy scenario that’s probably occurred to all of you: We are coming out of one of the worst economic downturns since the Great Depression. Jobs are not in abundance.\nFortunately, this doesn’t change the story—and that’s something that I can tell you from personal experience. I graduated from college in June 1983, when the unemployment rate was actually even higher than it is today. Now it is true that when I graduated, the slack job market put downward pressure on all wages, including those of college grads. However, over time, the wages of these June 1983 grads did rise, and the negative effects of the recession were largely lost. Even in a tough job market, my cohort found that college remained a good investment.\nAnd that’s my first reason for congratulating you! You’ve made a great financial investment. In fact, my bet is that few of you will ever make a better one. I never have.\nBut I have a second reason for why you should be so happy today. It’s related to a question that may have occurred to you already: If going to a four-year college is such a great deal, why don’t more people get four-year college degrees?\nThere are a lot of possible answers to this question, including some significant issues related to credit access. However, the most important answer is also the simplest answer: Some people like college better than others. Now, I’m not saying that there are some people who like college parties and other people who don’t. That’s probably true, but it’s not the main reason why some students invest $100K in themselves and others don’t. What I’m saying is that some people enjoy learning and others don’t. Those who like to learn—well, they go to college and spend four challenging years learning. Those who don’t like to learn—well, they don’t finish, and in many cases they don’t even start.2\nI think that this simple story—that people go to college because they like to learn—says something deep about college, and especially about a college of liberal arts. As a student, I took a lot of courses in the liberal arts. Economics, of course, but I also took courses in sociology, English legal history, American constitutional interpretation, Chaucer, art history, Asian music, and on and on.\nI have to admit that I have not retained as many details as I would like from these courses—so please don’t ask me about the constitutions of Clarendon or how a mob is different from a crowd. But even though I don’t retain all of the details, the courses were all important to me. I learned to approach new ideas with respect. I learned to make an argument. I learned to read and think critically. Basically, I learned to learn in college—and I loved learning to learn, because I loved learning.\nThat’s what any good college—and especially any good college of liberal arts—does. It takes people who like to learn and teaches them how to learn—not just at school but in all aspects of their lives. It is often rightly emphasized that this process is spiritually enriching. But to an economist like me, it’s important to emphasize its financial benefits.\nCollege grads get higher wages in part because they have already acquired valuable skills. But college grads also get higher wages because they like learning and know how to learn. Their ability and willingness to keep learning, and thereby acquire more skills, is also what allows their wages to grow so fast over time. And this is the second reason why I say congratulations to you—you’re a person who likes learning, and that’s allowed you to learn how to learn.\nI’m sure that you’ve realized over the past couple of weeks that nobody over the age of 40 ever talks for 10 minutes to a recent college grad without offering advice of some kind. Now you get to hear mine.\nI’ve told you that college was a good investment for you because you’re a learner. But to get most of the economic benefits from college, like the faster wage growth, you have to stay a learner for years and years and years. How do you stay a learner? To me, the answer to this question lies in confidence. You cannot learn without asking stupid questions. You cannot learn without revealing your ignorance. In other words, you cannot learn without having the confidence to make mistakes.\nYou’ve got that confidence now. It is a large part of what has led you here today. I urge you to strive to retain that confidence in the years to come. As an economist, I can tell you that it can make your income grow rapidly over time. As a person, I can tell you that it can keep you young even when all the physical signs say that you are not.\nOnce again, congratulations to you all!\nReferences\nHeckman, J., Lochner, L., and Todd, P., Earnings functions, rates of return, and treatment effects: The Mincer equation and beyond, National Bureau of Economic Research working paper 11544.\nFootnotes\n1 See Table 4, Heckman, et al.

We were wrong. This mismatch between our expectations and our realizations was the ultimate source of the financial crisis of 2007-09.\nThe Congress of the United States is currently considering legislation to restructure financial regulation. However, no matter how well-written or how well-intentioned the legislation may be, no law can completely eliminate the kinds of collective investor and regulator mistakes that lead to financial crises. These mistakes have taken place periodically for centuries. They will certainly do so again. And once these crises happen, there are strong economic forces that lead policymakers—for the best of reasons—to bail out financial firms. In other words, no legislation can completely eliminate bailouts. Any new financial regulatory structure must keep this reality in mind.\nMy theme today is that, although bailouts are inevitable, their magnitude can be limited by taxes on financial institutions. I arrive at this conclusion about the usefulness of taxes by thinking through an analogy that I’ll develop at some length. I will argue that, knowing bailouts are inevitable, financial institutions fail to internalize all the risks that their investment decisions impose on society. Economists would say that bailouts thereby create a risk “externality.” There is nearly a century of economic thought about how to deal with externalities of various sorts—and the usual answer is through taxation. I will suggest that the logic that argues for taxation to deal with other externalities is exactly applicable in this case as well. As always, any views I share today are my own, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\nMy case for taxing banks is distinct from one often heard in popular discourse. This latter logic usually runs: Taxpayers put X dollars into the banking sector, and the banking sector should repay all of that money. This argument is, I think, fundamentally grounded in a desire for revenge: Some big banks—perhaps now gone forever—took our money, and so all big banks must pay. Taxes are seen as punishment—a means of exacting retribution from the guilty (them) to compensate the innocent (us).\nMy story is different. At least some big banks did make socially undesirable choices. But — in large part—they were led to make those choices by incentives within the tax and regulatory system. Parts of these incentives were shaped by the ultimately correct expectation that some bailouts would take place in the event of a financial crisis. These government guarantees—no matter how implicit they might have been—created an incentive for financial institutions to make socially undesirable choices. Taxation is a useful way to correct this incentive.\nEarlier, I claimed that bailouts of financial institutions are certain to occur in financial crises. Why do I say this? There are many forces at play, but I believe that the strongest has to do with the very nature of financial intermediation. Investors in financial institutions always want the ability to pull out their funds quickly. For this reason, financial institutions’ liabilities often take the form of short-term debt and deposits. But such short-term financing instruments are intrinsically prone to self-fulfilling crises of confidence that economists term “runs.”\nImagine that Bank X needs $100 billion of one-day loans to survive. This means that for a given lender to be willing to make a $1-billion, one-day loan to Bank X, that lender has to believe that Bank X will get another $99 billion in one-day loans. Then, Bank X may fail simply because every possible lender believes correctly that no lender is willing to lend to Bank X. Such a crisis of confidence can occur regardless of the true condition of Bank X.\nThis story is hardly a new one. It’s exactly why we have deposit insurance: to prevent runs by reassuring bank depositors that their money is safe. But the story has huge consequences for how governments operate. In a financial crisis, there is a tremendous sense of uncertainty. There are some truly insolvent financial firms out there—but no one knows for sure which ones they are. And during a crisis, the panic in the air means that any institution—even one with solid fundamentals—may be subjected to a run if its investors lose confidence in its solvency.\nIn such an atmosphere, contagion effects become extremely powerful. Even a slight loss by one short-term creditor can lead all short-term lenders to rush to the safety of Treasury bills. Such flight would endanger the survival of key financial institutions, even if they are fundamentally sound. Governments cannot risk such systemic collapse, and so during times of crisis, they end up providing debt guarantees for all financial institutions. Thus, policymakers inevitably resort to bailouts even when they have explicitly resolved, in the strongest possible terms, to let firms fail.\nMany observers of the events of September 2008 have emphasized the need for better resolution mechanisms. Different people mean different things by this, but most want to impose losses on debt holders. I’m not opposed to faster resolutions of bankruptcies. But I do not believe that better resolution mechanisms will end bailouts. Indeed, I’m led to make a prediction. No matter what mechanisms we legislate now to impose losses on creditors, Congress, or some agency acting on Congress’ behalf, will block them when we next face a financial crisis. And Congress will do so for a very good reason: to forestall a run on the key players in the financial system.\nSo, that’s my first point: Bailouts are inevitable. Let me move to my next point: Bailouts create inefficiencies in the allocation of real investment. Here’s what I mean. Financial institutions make investments that are, by their very nature, risky—that is, their returns are not certain. They finance these investments, at least in part, using debt and deposits.\nNow, imagine for a moment that we live in a world without bailouts, so that the government does not provide debt guarantees or deposit insurance. If a financial institution decided to increase the risk level of its investment portfolio, its debt holders and depositors would face a greater risk of loss. By way of compensation for that greater risk, they’d demand a higher yield. As a result, in the absence of government guarantees, financial institutions would find it more costly to obtain debt financing for highly risky investments than for less risky ones. This effect, on the margin, would curb a firm’s appetite for risk. It would have an especially powerful effect on highly leveraged financial institutions, because high debt-to-asset levels mean higher risk of being unable to fulfill debt obligations.\nBut now return to the real world, with deposit insurance and debt guarantees, and the inevitability of government bailouts. Even if they only kick in during financial crises, these guarantees change this natural market relationship between risk and cost. The depositors and debt holders are now partially insulated from increases in investment risk, and so do not demand a sufficiently high yield from riskier firms. Financial institutions take on too much risk, because they are no longer deterred from doing so by the high costs of debt finance. And this missing deterrence is especially relevant for firms that are highly leveraged, because they should be paying out especially high yields on their debts.\nIn this way, the expectation of bailouts leads to too much capital being allocated toward overly risky ventures. These misallocations of capital don’t create the collective mistakes in predictions that generate financial crises. But the misallocations do mean that society loses a lot from those mistakes—a lot more than is efficient.\nWhat kind of policy would be useful in correcting this inefficiency? In what follows, I will offer an analogy from a completely different arena of public policy that can help us think through this key question.\nConsider a factory that creates air pollution as a byproduct of operation. When the firm that owns the factory chooses to produce more output, it incurs various private costs: more raw materials, more labor, and so on. But the production increase also generates more pollution that will be absorbed by the surrounding community. The pollution is a social cost of production not paid for, or “internalized,” by the firm that generates it. Economists refer to such costs as “externalities.”\nThis same distinction between private and social costs applies to financial institutions that are facing debt guarantees. Such guarantees imply that some portion of the risk produced by a firm’s investment decisions is absorbed by taxpayers. In making decisions about what to invest in, the firm ignores that portion of risk. It is a social cost of the project that the private firm does not internalize. Just like the pollution, the risk borne by taxpayers is an externality—what I will call a “risk externality.”\nThis analogy is useful because economists know a lot about how to deal with externalities. We can exploit their years of research to address the problem of financial regulation when government bailouts are inevitable. In particular, that long history of thought says that the best way to correct externalities is by providing the right kinds of incentives through appropriate taxes.\nLet me be more specific. Again, let’s think about the firm with a polluting factory. Many of its choices affect the amount of pollution produced, including the amount of time that the firm runs the factory during the workweek, the sorts of antipollution technology employed, and the kind of energy used to run the factory. Now, the government could regulate the firm’s pollution levels by controlling each and every one of these choices. However, to do so, the government has to choose how to trade off these three (and other) factors against one another.\nIts trade-off decisions will be influenced by both pollution considerations and cost factors. If antipollution technology is cheap, the government may simply require the firm to invest in that. But if antipollution technology is expensive, the government may require the firm to switch to using natural gas instead of coal. Making these trade-offs requires a tremendous amount of firm-specific information and firm-specific cost minimization. To put it mildly, historical evidence suggests that governments are not very good at such micromanagement of factory-level operation; that’s why we have private markets.\nThe solution to this difficulty is to regulate the amount of pollution produced by the firm, rather than how the firm produces that pollution. The central problem here is that pollution has a social cost that the firm does not internalize when choosing its level of production. From society’s point of view, the firm will overproduce pollution. However, the firm will choose the socially efficient level of pollution if it is required to pay for—or internalize—the social cost of the pollution.\nMore concretely, suppose that the firm is told, before choosing its level of production, that the government will measure the amount of pollution that the firm generates and charge the firm a tax that is exactly equal to the social cost of that quantity of pollution. This policy generates a tax schedule that translates the amount of pollution generated into an amount paid by the firm. If the firm knows that it faces this tax schedule, its costs of production will include the social cost of pollution, along with labor, materials, energy, and the like. In this way, what was external to the firm becomes internal. As a result, the firm will choose the socially efficient level of production. Just as importantly, it will automatically choose to produce that pollution—and its other more beneficial outputs—in a cost-minimizing fashion. The government does not need to solve the firm’s cost-minimization problem.\nThese lessons about pollution regulation translate directly into lessons about financial regulation. As in the pollution case, a financial institution should be taxed for the amount of risk it produces that is borne by taxpayers. The firm will then choose the socially optimal level of risk.\nHere’s my preferred policy. The firm is told that the government will estimate the expected, discounted value of bailouts that the financial institution (or any of its stakeholders) will receive in the future. I say “expected” because the amount of the bailout is uncertain (and indeed is likely to be zero much of the time). I say “discounted” because the bailout may be received next year or in 30 years, and we need to discount accordingly. Clearly, this estimate will depend on many firm choices and attributes, including its leverage ratio, the maturity structure of its liabilities, the risk characteristics of its investment portfolio, and its incentive compensation schemes. For example, the expected bailout will be higher for firms with highly risky investments than for firms with less risky portfolios.\nHaving done this calculation, the government then charges the firm a tax that is exactly equal to the expected discounted value of the firm’s bailouts. Just as in the pollution example, this measurement-plus-taxation policy confronts the firm with a tax schedule that translates its choices into a cost paid by the firm. The tax amount exactly equals the extra cost borne by the taxpayers because of bailouts, appropriately adjusted for risk and the time value of money. Knowing that it faces this tax schedule, the firm no longer has an incentive to undertake inefficiently risky investments. Its investment choices will be socially efficient. It is useful to tax a financial institution producing a risk externality, just as it is useful to tax a firm producing a pollution externality. The purpose of the tax in both instances is to ensure that the firm pays the full costs—private and social—of its production decisions.\nI emphasized that the pollution tax corrects the pollution externality without creating any new inefficiencies for the firm. The risk tax has the same property. Policymakers are considering a host of regulatory responses to the events of the past two and a half years, including higher capital requirements, leverage caps, and restrictions on incentive compensation. All of these potential changes are good in that they serve to lower the amount of risk-taking by financial institutions. However, they may also create new kinds of inefficiency for the targeted firms. For example, imposing new restrictions on incentive compensation may hamper a firm’s ability to motivate its employees. In contrast, my proposed risk tax, like the pollution tax, corrects the risk externality without creating any new inefficiencies.\nThe proposed tax does require bank supervisors to calculate the expected present value of future bailout payments. These calculations are likely to be complex in a number of ways. Moreover, the calculations could well be controversial. Financial institutions that follow highly risky strategies get especially high profits when those strategies are working. Thus, supervisors would be required to levy high risk taxes on exactly those institutions that appear extremely successful. For these reasons, it would be useful to develop an objective way to compute the required tax using market information.\nHere’s what I have in mind. Suppose that, for every relevant financial institution, the government issues a “rescue bond.” The rescue bond pays a variable coupon equal to 1/1000 of the transfers made from the taxpayer to the institution or its stakeholders. (I pick 1/1000 out of the air; any fixed fraction will do.) Much of the time, this coupon will be zero, because bailouts aren’t necessary and so the firm will not receive transfers. However, just like the institution’s stakeholders, the owners of the rescue bond will occasionally receive a large payment. In a well-functioning market, the price of this bond is exactly equal to the 1/1000 of the expected discounted value of the transfers to the firm and its stakeholders. Thus, the government should charge the financial firm a tax equal to 1000 times the price of the bond.\nNotice that this approach could be used for a wide variety of financial institutions, including nonbanks. In principle, the government need not figure out in advance exactly which are systemically important and which are not. Instead, it could simply issue a rescue bond for every institution. Then, the market itself could reveal how systemically important each institution is through the price of its rescue bonds. Of course, markets are not always perfect, and it would be inappropriate to rely only on market measures to compute the appropriate taxes. However, the prices of rescue bonds would contain valuable information that should be an important input into the supervisory process.\nAs I mentioned at the beginning, Congress is in the process of considering changes to the financial regulatory system. In December, the House passed the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Senate is currently deliberating the Restoring American Financial Stability Act. There is much to like in both pieces of legislation. However, neither piece of legislation incorporates the kind of risk tax that I have described to you. The Senate bill proposes no new taxes on financial institutions, unless some fail. In that event, taxes could be levied on surviving large financial institutions, regardless of whether or not they had actually engaged in excessive risk-taking. The House bill has a new risk-based assessment on large banks and hedge funds. Such a risk-adjusted tax should have desirable incentive effects on the targeted firms. However, the tax will end once it has raised $150 billion. This cap is problematic, because once the tax is ended, so too will its desirable incentive effects.\nWhy do the bills fail to include new levies of the kind that I propose? In my view, both bills significantly understate the extreme economic forces that lead to bailouts during financial crises. Indeed, the opening language of the Senate bill actually declares that it will end taxpayer bailouts. This objective is laudable. But it is not achievable—and thinking that it is can lead to poor choices about the structure of financial regulation.\nTo wrap up: Bailouts will inevitably happen during financial crises to prevent runs and systemic collapse. We need to structure financial regulation so as to limit the size and occurrence of these bailouts. How should we best design such regulations? The social distortion we face is that debt guarantees create a risk externality, because financial institutions do not bear the full costs of their investment choices. Financial regulation should be designed so as to best control that externality. As is true with any externality, the risk externality can be eliminated with a well-designed tax system. Figuring out the right tax may be complicated, but the task can be eased using appropriate information from financial markets.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, we—as investors, home buyers, and bank lenders—collectively bet that house prices would not fall by 30 percent in most major metropolitan areas in three years. We were wrong. This mismatch between our expectations and our realizations was the ultimate source of the financial crisis of 2007-09.\n\nThe Congress of the United States is currently considering legislation to restructure financial regulation.

However, the prices of rescue bonds would contain valuable information that should be an important input into the supervisory process.\n\nAs I mentioned at the beginning, Congress is in the process of considering changes to the financial regulatory system. In December, the House passed the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Senate is currently deliberating the Restoring American Financial Stability Act. There is much to like in both pieces of legislation. However, neither piece of legislation incorporates the kind of risk tax that I have described to you. The Senate bill proposes no new taxes on financial institutions, unless some fail. In that event, taxes could be levied on surviving large financial institutions, regardless of whether or not they had actually engaged in excessive risk-taking. The House bill has a new risk-based assessment on large banks and hedge funds. Such a risk-adjusted tax should have desirable incentive effects on the targeted firms. However, the tax will end once it has raised $150 billion. This cap is problematic, because once the tax is ended, so too will its desirable incentive effects.\n\nWhy do the bills fail to include new levies of the kind that I propose? In my view, both bills significantly understate the extreme economic forces that lead to bailouts during financial crises. Indeed, the opening language of the Senate bill actually declares that it will end taxpayer bailouts. This objective is laudable. But it is not achievable—and thinking that it is can lead to poor choices about the structure of financial regulation.\n\nTo wrap up: Bailouts will inevitably happen during financial crises to prevent runs and systemic collapse. We need to structure financial regulation so as to limit the size and occurrence of these bailouts. How should we best design such regulations? The social distortion we face is that debt guarantees create a risk externality, because financial institutions do not bear the full costs of their investment choices. Financial regulation should be designed so as to best control that externality. As is true with any externality, the risk externality can be eliminated with a well-designed tax system. Figuring out the right tax may be complicated, but the task can be eased using appropriate information from financial markets."

I’m beginning to realize that one of the benefits of being president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is that I will get to periodically visit your great state and this lovely community. I look forward to my return trips and hope I have a chance to meet with many of you again.\nToday I want to talk about the prospects for the U.S. economy and the Federal Reserve’s recent role in the economy, with particular emphasis on the part that housing plays in both of those issues. As you know, the Federal Reserve has been very active in the U.S. economy over the past two-and-a-half-years. Now the economy is on the mend. It is time for the Federal Reserve to think about how to go about resuming its more traditional role. In the latter part of my speech, I will discuss one aspect of this process: Federal Reserve balance sheet normalization.\nFirst, though, I want to talk about the state of the economy and offer you my forecast. Now, I have to say that the continued demand for economists’ forecasts is a little puzzling to me, given our track record. On that note, it’s been said that economists make predictions about gross domestic product to the hundredth decimal point for one reason: to prove that they have a sense of humor. Well, just to assure you that I am taking this all very seriously, I will keep my forecasts to the tenth decimal point. And before I begin, let me remind you that the following views are my own, and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve.\nLet me start my outlook with the most troubling information first. Housing starts and sales remain at near historically low levels. These data are disturbing to many observers. And that’s understandable. After many past recessions, residential investment has played a significant role in the subsequent recovery. Arguing by analogy, some are concerned that we cannot have a sustainable economic recovery unless housing starts pick up dramatically from their current low levels.\nI have to say that I’m somewhat skeptical of this thinking. Yes, the housing sector is important, but residential investment makes up just 2.8 percent of the country’s gross domestic product. The U.S. economy is a wonderfully diverse one, and has many possible sources of growth. We can—and I believe that we will—have significant growth in output without seeing a major turnaround in the housing market.\nBut suppose for a moment that we do accept the claim that housing is somehow critical for an economic turnaround. I’m not sure how, if at all, it would affect my thinking as a monetary policymaker. The Federal Reserve can only influence the housing market by manipulating interest rates. But there is little evidence that interest rates have a big influence on housing starts. For example, in a 2007 National Bureau of Economic Research paper on housing and the business cycle, UCLA professor Edward Leamer estimated a relationship between current housing starts, past housing starts, and interest rates. The Minneapolis Fed banking studies group has used Leamer’s estimates to calculate the impact of a 100-basis-point permanent decrease in 10-year Treasury yields on housing starts one year from now. The group has found that housing starts would be 11 percent higher with the rate cut than without it. This effect would be barely noticeable, given that housing starts need to nearly triple to get back to their normal level.\nHousing starts are more strongly affected by the general health of the economy (job growth or loss) and the stock of housing relative to demand. As I see it, the problems in the housing sector right now are largely driven by this second factor. For a number of reasons, the nation has built a lot more houses than it now needs or wants. As a result, my own prediction is that housing starts are going to remain low—possibly for several years.\nWhat does the large supply of housing mean for the general economy? It means that resources formerly dedicated to building and outfitting homes are gradually shifting to other uses. This points out another remarkable feature of the U.S. economy: its flexibility. Resources in the U.S. economy—from financial capital to human capital—can move freely from one sector to another. Clearly, this reallocation process is difficult in many ways. In particular, it takes place only because companies cut production or close their doors, and accordingly cut their workforces. These workers have to find jobs elsewhere, and they endure the trauma of being unemployed. Nonetheless, the reallocation process is a necessary one if an economy is to regain its health and start growing again.\nThe reallocation process is at work today in the United States—more slowly than we would like, but at work. Housing starts have remained at a very low level in recent months, but the economy has nonetheless begun to recover. GDP began to grow in the third quarter of 2009. In fact, that growth rate accelerated to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 5.6 percent in the fourth quarter.\nWill this turnaround in GDP continue in the coming months and years? I believe it will, but I am not as optimistic as other economists. And since I have recently spoken at greater length about my forecast, I will give you the condensed version. My own forecast calls for about 3 percent growth per year over the next two years, as opposed to the consensus view among economists, which is 3.5 percent. This pessimism derives from two sources. First, our statistical forecasting model at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is predicting that GDP growth over this period will be around 2.5 percent per year. The model is a simple one in many ways, but its forecasting track record is surprisingly good.\nSecond, financial markets have largely healed from the traumas of 2007-09. But the banking sector faces ongoing problems. Banks with large amounts of commercial real estate risk-exposure face a correspondingly elevated risk of failure. This threat could well lead to continued declines in bank lending, which would curtail the recovery.\nTo this point in my forecast, I have been discussing broad factors that can affect GDP growth. However, as I mentioned earlier, GDP does not tell the full story of the impact of recessions. We need to also be thinking about unemployment.\nUnemployment is currently 9.7 percent. It has been higher in the post-World War II period—it reached 10.8 percent in the bleak fall of 1982. However, in the 25-year span between January 1984 and January 2009, unemployment never topped 8 percent. It is safe to say that those born after 1968 have never experienced an economic episode of this kind in their working lives. It is also safe to say that the Federal Reserve is certainly not meeting its full employment mandate when unemployment is at 9.7 percent.\nCertainly, there has been some good news in labor markets. Unemployment has declined from its high of 10.1 percent in October 2009. In March, nonfarm payroll employment increased by 162,000 jobs—the biggest increase in three years. Nonetheless, I still think the outlook for unemployment is not promising. Unemployment is notoriously slow to recover, and the rate has been especially slow to decline after the last two milder recessions of 1990-91 and 2000-01. I would be surprised if unemployment were below 9 percent by the end of 2010 or below 8 percent by the end of 2011.\nLet me end this discussion of my outlook on a more positive note, with a caveat to follow. The positive news in this economy is that inflation has been relatively tame. From the fourth quarter of 2007 to the fourth quarter of 2009, PCE inflation has averaged slightly less than 1.5 percent per year. Over that same period, core PCE inflation (subtracting food and energy) averaged around 1.7 percent per year. The Federal Reserve is keeping inflation at levels consistent with good long-run economic performance.\nHere’s the caveat: Deposit institutions are holding over a trillion dollars in excess reserves (that is, over 15 times what they are required to hold given their deposits). These excess reserves create the potential for high inflation. Suppose that households believe that prices will rise. They would then demand more deposits to use for transactions. Banks can readily accommodate this extra demand, because they are holding so many excess reserves. These extra deposits become extra money chasing the same amount of goods and so generate upward pressure on prices. The households’ inflationary expectations would, in fact, become self-fulfilling.\nWhy might households expect an increase in inflation? The amount of federal government debt held by the private sector has gone up by over 30 percent since the beginning of 2008. This debt can only be paid by tax collections or by the Federal Reserve’s debt monetization (that is, by printing dollars to pay off the obligations incurred by Congress). If households begin to expect that the latter will be true—even if it is not—their inflationary expectations will rise as well.\nI hasten to say—and I want to stress—that I view this scenario as unlikely. For it to transpire, the country would need a combination of bad monetary policy and poor fiscal management. I do not foresee this combination as likely to occur. Nonetheless, good policy requires good choices, and policymakers at the Federal Reserve and in Congress need to keep this scenario in mind when making their decisions. I can assure you that we in the Federal Reserve have every intention of keeping our end of the bargain.\nSo, to summarize my economic forecast, I do think that the economy is on the mend and should continue to recover over the next two years—in terms of both GDP and unemployment—but at slower rates than we would like. The outlook for inflation is basically promising, as long as the Federal Reserve and Congress work together appropriately. And as for housing: Housing will recover eventually. In the meantime, the general economy has already begun the recovery process.\nAnd so, the economy has begun to normalize from the events of the past 30 months. It seems like a good time for the Federal Reserve to think about how to normalize policy. I want to spend the rest of my time talking about one aspect of this normalization process. The Federal Reserve has more than doubled its assets since September 2008. This expansion has taken two distinct forms: making new kinds of loans and buying new kinds of securities. At this point, the new loans are mostly gone from our balance sheet. The new securities are very much still with us. As a result, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet looks both larger in scale and different in composition from 2007. In the remainder of my talk, I will discuss what the FOMC is targeting as “balance sheet normalization.” I will also offer some thoughts about the process needed to accomplish this goal.\nI said that the Federal Reserve made new kinds of loans and bought new kinds of securities. In terms of making new kinds of loans, the Board of Governors and the New York Fed worked together to open a number of short-term lending facilities during 2008 and into 2009. Their objective was to set borrowing rates and collateral requirements on these facilities to meet two conflicting targets: Borrowers would want to use them when financial markets were strained, and borrowers would not use them when financial markets were not strained. Despite some skepticism among outside observers, the facilities worked exactly as intended.\nAt their onset, in late 2008 and early 2009, the new lending facilities were critical in improving the functioning of financial markets. Let me pick a date—January 28, 2009. On that date, the Federal Reserve had a balance sheet of roughly 2 trillion dollars. The Federal Reserve held 500 billion dollars worth of Treasuries and under 10 billion dollars worth of mortgage-backed securities. It held 500 billion dollars worth of central bank liquidity swaps—essentially short-term dollar loans to other central banks. And it held about 700 billion dollars worth of loans to banks and issuers of commercial paper through the discount window, the term auction facility, and the commercial paper funding facility.\nNow fast-forward to January 2010. The use of the various special lending facilities had declined sharply. As a result, the Federal Reserve closed virtually all of them as of February 1, 2010, and held its last term auction on March 8. The facilities worked exactly as intended: They provided necessary support when financial markets were strained and vanished when they were not. It is worth noting too that the Federal Reserve lost not a single penny on any of these loans.\nThus, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has normalized in the sense that this new kind of lending has largely disappeared. But as of March 24, the Federal Reserve still has a balance sheet of over 2 trillion dollars, swollen by its holdings of unusual securities. In particular, the Federal Reserve owns about 1.1 trillion dollars in agency mortgage-backed securities and about 170 billion dollars in agency debt. The term “agency” refers to the fact that these securities are issued by government-sponsored enterprises that are involved in housing finance (primarily Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac). Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac create the MBSs by buying mortgages from around the country and bundling them together. The underlying mortgages are all fixed-rate ones, and all of the mortgages in a particular MBS have the same interest rate.\nThese assets may sound “toxic,” to use the language of 2008. But all of these instruments are guaranteed by the U.S. taxpayer, and so the Federal Reserve itself faces no default or credit risk. Of course, if many borrowers do default on their mortgages, taxpayers suffer losses because taxpayers are backing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. But those losses are an issue for Congress and the Treasury—they do not find their way through to the Federal Reserve.\nHowever, the Federal Reserve faces two other forms of risk in these securities. First, these securities are long term, and so their value responds to changes in long-term interest rates. Second, if interest rates fall, then more people will prepay their mortgages as they refinance. This means that the coupon payments that the Federal Reserve receives from a given agency MBS have an additional source of sensitivity to changes in long-term interest rates.\nThe minutes from the January 2010 FOMC meeting say that the participants were unanimous that, in the long run, they would like the Federal Reserve to have a much smaller balance sheet. There are a number of reasons for this preference, but certainly one is the concern about inflationary risks that I discussed earlier.\nFOMC participants were also unanimous that, in the long run, the Federal Reserve should be holding only Treasuries. Why does the FOMC feel this way? There are several reasons, and different participants probably put differing weight on them. The first reason is simple. We want to return to our pre-2007 ways of conducting monetary policy. We feel that we understand that framework well—although not perfectly—and want to use it again in the future.\nThe second reason has to do with appearances. We originally bought Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac instruments to accomplish two goals. The first objective was financial: We were trying to help improve liquidity conditions in the markets for those particular important instruments. The second objective was a macroeconomic one: The Federal Reserve wanted to lower all long-term interest rates. In my view, buying the agency securities was good policy, given market and macroeconomic circumstances in 2008 and 2009. But, in the long run, owning the obligations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mae gives the impression that the Federal Reserve is in the business of allocating credit to a particular small sector of the economy—namely, the housing sector. We don’t want to be seen as being in the game of choosing which sector to back among the many in the economy.\nFinally, at least some of us have a prejudice against holding long-term securities, no matter who issues them. Holding long-term securities means that we have maturity mismatches between our assets and our liabilities. These mismatches expose us to interest rate risk that we’d rather avoid.\nSo, the bottom line is that we want to have a smaller balance sheet and to get out of agency securities. To accomplish these goals, we could use a passive approach, an active approach, or both. The passive approach is to maintain our existing holdings of securities and engage in no further purchases or sales. Over time, some of the securities will mature. As well, people will prepay the mortgages underlying the MBSs as they sell their houses and refinance. Together, maturation and prepayment will lead to a reduction in the part of our balance sheet in MBSs.\nThe problem with the passive approach is that it is slow. Many of the MBSs bought by the Federal Reserve were new issues that will mature as late as 2040. As a result, if the Federal Reserve relies only on the passive approach, it will still be holding some amount of mortgage-backed securities as late as 2040. How much the Federal Reserve will be holding at that late date depends on how fast people prepay their mortgages. Prepayment speeds are hard to estimate with any degree of confidence, because they depend on rates of refinancing, and those depend on whether interest rates turn out to be high or low.\nWith this caveat in mind, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis banking studies group has done the following illustrative exercise. The New York Fed has every MBS owned by the Federal Reserve System listed on its Web site. The Minneapolis Fed’s banking studies group obtained data from Bloomberg on the largest quintile of these MBSs by value and used those data to estimate the rate of prepayment on these MBSs over the past year. The group found that this rate of prepayment was sufficiently slow that only half of the mortgages will vanish from the balance sheet every 10 years. This estimate implies that as late as 2030, the Federal Reserve will still be holding something like 250 billion dollars in mortgage-backed securities.\nSo, the passive approach is a slow approach that will leave the Federal Reserve holding significant amounts of MBSs for many years to come. If the Federal Reserve wants to normalize its balance sheet in the next five, 10, or even 20 years, it needs to supplement the passive approach with an active one. In plain English, it will have to sell mortgage-backed securities.\nSales present an unusual challenge for the Federal Reserve, because they require us to be able to make a particular kind of credible commitment. To understand this commitment, I think that it’s useful for me to talk through a situation that I see as roughly analogous.\nSuppose Sarah owns two houses on the same block. Sarah decides that she wants to sell both houses. How should Sarah accomplish this change?\nClearly, if Sarah tries to sell both of her houses at once, she’s going to suffer some serious losses. The houses are on the same block, and so they end up competing with each other. Sarah needs to sell the houses slowly over time, so that they don’t compete with each other. Obviously, how slowly would depend on the particulars of market conditions. In my neighborhood right now, selling one house per year would be about the right speed.\nSo suppose Sarah puts one house on the market and tells everyone that she’s not going to sell the other one until a year later. Then, she sells the first house after a month. It sells at a high price, because the buyers don’t want to wait a whole year to get a house on this particular block.\nAt this stage, Sarah is supposed to wait a year to sell her second house. But Sarah was only planning to wait so long to sell the second house to protect the first house from competition. Once the first house is sold at a high price, she has no reason to wait. She will not fulfill her promise to wait a year.\nNow think about what Sarah’s inability to wait means for her first sale. The potential buyers of the first house will all realize that they won’t have to wait a year to get a house on the same block. They will not be willing to pay a high price for the first house. And so Sarah’s lack of credibility means that the first house will necessarily sell at the same price as if she’s actually selling both houses at the same time.\nThe Federal Reserve faces exactly these same problems when undertaking to sell MBSs. Like Sarah, if the Federal Reserve were to sell its holdings of MBSs all at once, the sales price of the MBSs would be low. Long-term interest rates would spike up, which the Federal Reserve doesn’t want. Like Sarah, the Federal Reserve can avoid this problem by spacing its sales out over time. But just like Sarah, the Federal Reserve faces a commitment problem. The Federal Reserve wants to sell gradually in large part to ensure that its early sales of MBSs are at a high price. But once those early sales are made, the Federal Reserve has an increased incentive to sell its remaining MBSs rapidly. And as in Sarah’s case, if the market believes that the Federal Reserve will act on this increased incentive, the Federal Reserve will only be able to sell its early MBSs at a low price. Under this story, any MBS sales—no matter how small—may have big effects on long-term interest rates.\nSo far, sales sound pretty challenging! Fortunately, the analogy between the Federal Reserve and Sarah is incomplete. The difference gets at the very heart of what the Federal Reserve is about. Our structure—and in particular our independence from Congress and the president—means that we are set up to act in the public’s long-run interest, not to maximize short-run political or monetary gain. This structure means that, with the right set of policymakers on the FOMC, the Federal Reserve can credibly make and keep long-run commitments. Indeed, our credibility has been critical in the past crisis. Since July 2007, the monetary base has more than doubled, and the public debt has gone up by over 30 percent. At the same time, though, long-run inflationary expectations—as embedded in the prices of 5-year and 10-year inflation-indexed TIPS bonds—have moved slightly, if at all. The public and markets trust the Federal Reserve to keep inflation under control—and we will fulfill their trust.\nOur structure means too that the Federal Reserve can credibly commit to selling its MBSs slowly over time. Along these lines, in testimony before Congress in late March, Chairman Bernanke described how he expected MBS sales to work. He emphasized that the timing of initiating sales, like any other move by the FOMC, would depend on its assessment of economic conditions. But once conditions are right, he suggested that the Federal Reserve could reduce its balance sheet by pre-announcing and then implementing a slow, gradual path of sales.\nI’ve always been a numbers guy, and so I find it helpful in my own thinking to put some actual numbers on the table. To pick one of many possible plans, suppose we were to commit to the public to sell 15 billion to 25 billion dollars worth per month of MBSs. This path of sales, combined with prepayments, would get the Federal Reserve out of MBSs within five years after the start of selling. The plan would also return the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet to a normal size, so that excess reserves would be normalized at their 2007 levels well before the end of the five-year period. Just as important, I feel confident that this pace of sales would be sufficiently slow that it would have little or no impact on MBS prices and long-term interest rates.\nTo sum up: It is likely that the Federal Reserve will have to sell a nontrivial amount of its MBS holdings if it is to be able to normalize its balance sheet in the next two decades. Such sales might cause untoward jumps in interest rates unless the Federal Reserve is able to credibly commit to a sufficiently slow pace. Fortunately, as is true in all realms of monetary policy, the Federal Reserve is well situated to make, communicate, and carry out such a commitment. I am optimistic that we will be able to normalize our balance sheet by the end of the teens.\nI’ve covered a lot of ground in this talk—from the housing sector to the general economy to the Fed balance sheet. My overarching theme has been the issue of normalization after the recession. That normalization will, in my view, be slow in the housing sector. But despite the ongoing difficulties in this sector, the recovery process seems underway in the general economy. It is time for us in the Federal Reserve to begin to think about the process of normalization of our balance sheet, and how that process is likely to work.\nThis concludes my remarks, but let me close by thanking all of you for this invitation. Some of you in this room have worked formally with the Federal Reserve Bank in the past, either as a member of our Board of Directors or as a member of one of our business advisory councils. Others of you—or representatives of your companies—have shared business insights that help us better understand what’s going on in the economy. That local representation is part of what makes the Federal Reserve System unique. So thanks to all of you who have worked with us in the past, and as for the rest of you—we’ll be in touch. And now I would be happy to take your questions.\n\nThank you for that introduction, and thank you very much for the opportunity to meet with you today. I’m beginning to realize that one of the benefits of being president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis is that I will get to periodically visit your great state and this lovely community. I look forward to my return trips and hope I have a chance to meet with many of you again.\n\nToday I want to talk about the prospects for the U.S. economy and the Federal Reserve’s recent role in the economy, with particular emphasis on the part that housing plays in both of those issues.

The positive news in this economy is that inflation has been relatively tame. From the fourth quarter of 2007 to the fourth quarter of 2009, PCE inflation has averaged slightly less than 1.5 percent per year. Over that same period, core PCE inflation (subtracting food and energy) averaged around 1.7 percent per year. The Federal Reserve is keeping inflation at levels consistent with good long-run economic performance.\n\nHere’s the caveat: Deposit institutions are holding over a trillion dollars in excess reserves (that is, over 15 times what they are required to hold given their deposits). These excess reserves create the potential for high inflation. Suppose that households believe that prices will rise. They would then demand more deposits to use for transactions. Banks can readily accommodate this extra demand, because they are holding so many excess reserves. These extra deposits become extra money chasing the same amount of goods and so generate upward pressure on prices. The households’ inflationary expectations would, in fact, become self-fulfilling.\n\nWhy might households expect an increase in inflation? The amount of federal government debt held by the private sector has gone up by over 30 percent since the beginning of 2008. This debt can only be paid by tax collections or by the Federal Reserve’s debt monetization (that is, by printing dollars to pay off the obligations incurred by Congress). If households begin to expect that the latter will be true—even if it is not—their inflationary expectations will rise as well.\n\nI hasten to say—and I want to stress—that I view this scenario as unlikely. For it to transpire, the country would need a combination of bad monetary policy and poor fiscal management. I do not foresee this combination as likely to occur. Nonetheless, good policy requires good choices, and policymakers at the Federal Reserve and in Congress need to keep this scenario in mind when making their decisions. I can assure you that we in the Federal Reserve have every intention of keeping our end of the bargain.\n\nSo, to summarize my economic forecast, I do think that the economy is on the mend and should continue to recover over the next two years—in terms of both GDP and unemployment—but at slower rates than we would like. The outlook for inflation is basically promising, as long as the Federal Reserve and Congress work together appropriately. And as for housing: Housing will recover eventually. In the meantime, the general economy has already begun the recovery process.\n\nAnd so, the economy has begun to normalize from the events of the past 30 months. It seems like a good time for the Federal Reserve to think about how to normalize policy. I want to spend the rest of my time talking about one aspect of this normalization process. The Federal Reserve has more than doubled its assets since September 2008. This expansion has taken two distinct forms: making new kinds of loans and buying new kinds of securities. At this point, the new loans are mostly gone from our balance sheet. The new securities are very much still with us. As a result, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet looks both larger in scale and different in composition from 2007. In the remainder of my talk, I will discuss what the FOMC is targeting as “balance sheet normalization.” I will also offer some thoughts about the process needed to accomplish this goal.\n\nI said that the Federal Reserve made new kinds of loans and bought new kinds of securities. In terms of making new kinds of loans, the Board of Governors and the New York Fed worked together to open a number of short-term lending facilities during 2008 and into 2009. Their objective was to set borrowing rates and collateral requirements on these facilities to meet two conflicting targets: Borrowers would want to use them when financial markets were strained, and borrowers would not use them when financial markets were not strained. Despite some skepticism among outside observers, the facilities worked exactly as intended.\n\nAt their onset, in late 2008 and early 2009, the new lending facilities were critical in improving the functioning of financial markets. Let me pick a date—January 28, 2009. On that date, the Federal Reserve had a balance sheet of roughly 2 trillion dollars. The Federal Reserve held 500 billion dollars worth of Treasuries and under 10 billion dollars worth of mortgage-backed securities. It held 500 billion dollars worth of central bank liquidity swaps—essentially short-term dollar loans to other central banks. And it held about 700 billion dollars worth of loans to banks and issuers of commercial paper through the discount window, the term auction facility, and the commercial paper funding facility.\n\nNow fast-forward to January 2010. The use of the various special lending facilities had declined sharply. As a result, the Federal Reserve closed virtually all of them as of February 1, 2010, and held its last term auction on March 8. The facilities worked exactly as intended: They provided necessary support when financial markets were strained and vanished when they were not. It is worth noting too that the Federal Reserve lost not a single penny on any of these loans.\n\nThus, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has normalized in the sense that this new kind of lending has largely disappeared. But as of March 24, the Federal Reserve still has a balance sheet of over 2 trillion dollars, swollen by its holdings of unusual securities. In particular, the Federal Reserve owns about 1.1 trillion dollars in agency mortgage-backed securities and about 170 billion dollars in agency debt. The term “agency” refers to the fact that these securities are issued by government-sponsored enterprises that are involved in housing finance (primarily Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac). Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac create the MBSs by buying mortgages from around the country and bundling them together. The underlying mortgages are all fixed-rate ones, and all of the mortgages in a particular MBS have the same interest rate.\n\nThese assets may sound “toxic,” to use the language of 2008. But all of these instruments are guaranteed by the U.S. taxpayer, and so the Federal Reserve itself faces no default or credit risk. Of course, if many borrowers do default on their mortgages, taxpayers suffer losses because taxpayers are backing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. But those losses are an issue for Congress and the Treasury—they do not find their way through to the Federal Reserve.\n\nHowever, the Federal Reserve faces two other forms of risk in these securities. First, these securities are long term, and so their value responds to changes in long-term interest rates. Second, if interest rates fall, then more people will prepay their mortgages as they refinance. This means that the coupon payments that the Federal Reserve receives from a given agency MBS have an additional source of sensitivity to changes in long-term interest rates.\n\nThe minutes from the January 2010 FOMC meeting say that the participants were unanimous that, in the long run, they would like the Federal Reserve to have a much smaller balance sheet. There are a number of reasons for this preference, but certainly one is the concern about inflationary risks that I discussed earlier.\n\nFOMC participants were also unanimous that, in the long run, the Federal Reserve should be holding only Treasuries. Why does the FOMC feel this way? There are several reasons, and different participants probably put differing weight on them. The first reason is simple. We want to return to our pre-2007 ways of conducting monetary policy. We feel that we understand that framework well—although not perfectly—and want to use it again in the future.\n\nThe second reason has to do with appearances. We originally bought Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac instruments to accomplish two goals. The first objective was financial: We were trying to help improve liquidity conditions in the markets for those particular important instruments. The second objective was a macroeconomic one: The Federal Reserve wanted to lower all long-term interest rates. In my view, buying the agency securities was good policy, given market and macroeconomic circumstances in 2008 and 2009. But, in the long run, owning the obligations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mae gives the impression that the Federal Reserve is in the business of allocating credit to a particular small sector of the economy—namely, the housing sector. We don’t want to be seen as being in the game of choosing which sector to back among the many in the economy.\n\nFinally, at least some of us have a prejudice against holding long-term securities, no matter who issues them. Holding long-term securities means that we have maturity mismatches between our assets and our liabilities. These mismatches expose us to interest rate risk that we’d rather avoid.\n\nSo, the bottom line is that we want to have a smaller balance sheet and to get out of agency securities. To accomplish these goals, we could use a passive approach, an active approach, or both. The passive approach is to maintain our existing holdings of securities and engage in no further purchases or sales. Over time, some of the securities will mature. As well, people will prepay the mortgages underlying the MBSs as they sell their houses and refinance. Together, maturation and prepayment will lead to a reduction in the part of our balance sheet in MBSs.\n\nThe problem with the passive approach is that it is slow. Many of the MBSs bought by the Federal Reserve were new issues that will mature as late as 2040. As a result, if the Federal Reserve relies only on the passive approach, it will still be holding some amount of mortgage-backed securities as late as 2040. How much the Federal Reserve will be holding at that late date depends on how fast people prepay their mortgages. Prepayment speeds are hard to estimate with any degree of confidence, because they depend on rates of refinancing, and those depend on whether interest rates turn out to be high or low.\n\nWith this caveat in mind, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis banking studies group has done the following illustrative exercise. The New York Fed has every MBS owned by the Federal Reserve System listed on its Web site. The Minneapolis Fed’s banking studies group obtained data from Bloomberg on the largest quintile of these MBSs by value and used those data to estimate the rate of prepayment on these MBSs over the past year. The group found that this rate of prepayment was sufficiently slow that only half of the mortgages will vanish from the balance sheet every 10 years. This estimate implies that as late as 2030, the Federal Reserve will still be holding something like 250 billion dollars in mortgage-backed securities.\n\nSo, the passive approach is a slow approach that will leave the Federal Reserve holding significant amounts of MBSs for many years to come. If the Federal Reserve wants to normalize its balance sheet in the next five, 10, or even 20 years, it needs to supplement the passive approach with an active one. In plain English, it will have to sell mortgage-backed securities.\n\nSales present an unusual challenge for the Federal Reserve, because they require us to be able to make a particular kind of credible commitment. To understand this commitment, I think that it’s useful for me to talk through a situation that I see as roughly analogous.\n\nSuppose Sarah owns two houses on the same block. Sarah decides that she wants to sell both houses. How should Sarah accomplish this change?\n\nClearly, if Sarah tries to sell both of her houses at once, she’s going to suffer some serious losses. The houses are on the same block, and so they end up competing with each other. Sarah needs to sell the houses slowly over time, so that they don’t compete with each other. Obviously, how slowly would depend on the particulars of market conditions. In my neighborhood right now, selling one house per year would be about the right speed.\n\nSo suppose Sarah puts one house on the market and tells everyone that she’s not going to sell the other one until a year later. Then, she sells the first house after a month. It sells at a high price, because the buyers don’t want to wait a whole year to get a house on this particular block.\n\nAt this stage, Sarah is supposed to wait a year to sell her second house. But Sarah was only planning to wait so long to sell the second house to protect the first house from competition. Once the first house is sold at a high price, she has no reason to wait. She will not fulfill her promise to wait a year.\n\nNow think about what Sarah’s inability to wait means for her first sale. The potential buyers of the first house will all realize that they won’t have to wait a year to get a house on the same block. They will not be willing to pay a high price for the first house. And so Sarah’s lack of credibility means that the first house will necessarily sell at the same price as if she’s actually selling both houses at the same time.\n\nThe Federal Reserve faces exactly these same problems when undertaking to sell MBSs. Like Sarah, if the Federal Reserve were to sell its holdings of MBSs all at once, the sales price of the MBSs would be low. Long-term interest rates would spike up, which the Federal Reserve doesn’t want. Like Sarah, the Federal Reserve can avoid this problem by spacing its sales out over time. But just like Sarah, the Federal Reserve faces a commitment problem. The Federal Reserve wants to sell gradually in large part to ensure that its early sales of MBSs are at a high price. But once those early sales are made, the Federal Reserve has an increased incentive to sell its remaining MBSs rapidly. And as in Sarah’s case, if the market believes that the Federal Reserve will act on this increased incentive, the Federal Reserve will only be able to sell its early MBSs at a low price. Under this story, any MBS sales—no matter how small—may have big effects on long-term interest rates.\n\nSo far, sales sound pretty challenging! Fortunately, the analogy between the Federal Reserve and Sarah is incomplete. The difference gets at the very heart of what the Federal Reserve is about. Our structure—and in particular our independence from Congress and the president—means that we are set up to act in the public’s long-run interest, not to maximize short-run political or monetary gain. This structure means that, with the right set of policymakers on the FOMC, the Federal Reserve can credibly make and keep long-run commitments. Indeed, our credibility has been critical in the past crisis. Since July 2007, the monetary base has more than doubled, and the public debt has gone up by over 30 percent. At the same time, though, long-run inflationary expectations—as embedded in the prices of 5-year and 10-year inflation-indexed TIPS bonds—have moved slightly, if at all. The public and markets trust the Federal Reserve to keep inflation under control—and we will fulfill their trust.\nOur structure means too that the Federal Reserve can credibly commit to selling its MBSs slowly over time. Along these lines, in testimony before Congress in late March, Chairman Bernanke described how he expected MBS sales to work. He emphasized that the timing of initiating sales, like any other move by the FOMC, would depend on its assessment of economic conditions. But once conditions are right, he suggested that the Federal Reserve could reduce its balance sheet by pre-announcing and then implementing a slow, gradual path of sales.\n\nI’ve always been a numbers guy, and so I find it helpful in my own thinking to put some actual numbers on the table. To pick one of many possible plans, suppose we were to commit to the public to sell 15 billion to 25 billion dollars worth per month of MBSs. This path of sales, combined with prepayments, would get the Federal Reserve out of MBSs within five years after the start of selling. The plan would also return the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet to a normal size, so that excess reserves would be normalized at their 2007 levels well before the end of the five-year period. Just as important, I feel confident that this pace of sales would be sufficiently slow that it would have little or no impact on MBS prices and long-term interest rates.\n\nTo sum up: It is likely that the Federal Reserve will have to sell a nontrivial amount of its MBS holdings if it is to be able to normalize its balance sheet in the next two decades. Such sales might cause untoward jumps in interest rates unless the Federal Reserve is able to credibly commit to a sufficiently slow pace. Fortunately, as is true in all realms of monetary policy, the Federal Reserve is well situated to make, communicate, and carry out such a commitment. I am optimistic that we will be able to normalize our balance sheet by the end of the teens.\n\nI’ve covered a lot of ground in this talk—from the housing sector to the general economy to the Fed balance sheet. My overarching theme has been the issue of normalization after the recession. That normalization will, in my view, be slow in the housing sector. But despite the ongoing difficulties in this sector, the recovery process seems underway in the general economy. It is time for us in the Federal Reserve to begin to think about the process of normalization of our balance sheet, and how that process is likely to work.\n\nThis concludes my remarks, but let me close by thanking all of you for this invitation. Some of you in this room have worked formally with the Federal Reserve Bank in the past, either as a member of our Board of Directors or as a member of one of our business advisory councils. Others of you—or representatives of your companies—have shared business insights that help us better understand what’s going on in the economy. That local representation is part of what makes the Federal Reserve System unique. So thanks to all of you who have worked with us in the past, and as for the rest of you—we’ll be in touch. And now I would be happy to take your questions."

            "content": "Paper: Financial Conditions Indexes: A Fresh Look after the Financial Crisis [PDF] (from the 2010 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum)\nIntroduction\nIn this paper, the authors construct a new financial conditions index (FCI). As its name suggests, an FCI is a summary statistic that gauges how well financial markets are working. Before I continue, let me make the usual disclaimer and stress that the following views are mine, and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve. The FCI in this paper has three novel features relative to earlier indices. First, it is constructed from a large number (44!) of distinct data series. These different series cover different sample periods (different beginning and end dates). The authors are able to use all of these distinct sources of information because they exploit relatively novel unbalanced panel estimation techniques to construct their index.\nSecond, the authors purge their FCI of information related to current and lagged GDP growth and inflation. They do so to better isolate information in financial markets themselves, as opposed to other parts of the economy.\nFinally, prior FCIs are constructed to be the principal component of a number of underlying data series. Implicitly, these constructions are assuming that the underlying data series are largely driven by a single factor. The authors allow for the possibility that their 44 data series are generated by multiple factors (specifically three).\nThe authors use pseudo-out-of-sample forecasting exercises to evaluate their new FCI in terms of its ability to predict future GDP growth. Generally speaking, they find that the new FCI does somewhat better than a basic autoregressive (AR) model (in which lags of past GDP growth are used to forecast future GDP growth) and prior FCIs. The superior performance is especially pronounced in the past five years. However, the new FCI does considerably worse than these alternative models in the latter part of the 1990s.\nI enjoyed reading this paper. I was especially impressed by how the authors exploited high-powered econometrics to combine information from so many distinct sources.\nThe authors focus on the use of the FCI as a forecasting tool. This is indeed an important question, and we learn much from their analysis. In my remarks, I will focus on a related but distinct question: How should we measure financial market conditions so as to best guide monetary policymakers’ decisions?\nMy discussion will begin with a brief—and certainly overly simplistic—description of three kinds of financial market frictions: collateral scarcity, asymmetric information, and illiquidity. (Admittedly, these terms are used in a variety of ways in the economics literature, and you will have to wait to hear how I’m using them.) Especially in light of the past two and a half years, it seems reasonable to think that the severity of these frictions may vary over time. I will argue, though, that the different frictions translate into different policy responses. As a result, economic theory strongly suggests that one needs more than a single variable to get a measure of financial market conditions that is useful for policymakers. I will try to provide some (crude!) guidance about how to parse the data to arrive at the relevant information.\nThree Frictions\nI discuss three frictions in asset markets and appropriate policy responses to their becoming more severe. Throughout, it is worth keeping in mind that government interventions typically have some administrative costs. These costs mean that interventions are certainly inappropriate when the frictions are relatively small in size.\nCollateral\nIn frictionless credit markets, firms are fully able to capitalize their flow of future profits. In practice, lenders realize that borrowers may be able to hide or divert profits. As a result, a firm’s borrowing capacity is generally affected by the market value of its holdings of collateral. Appropriate notions of collateral vary from context to context. However, whatever their form, collateral requirements impose a connection between a firm’s ability to borrow and the market value of its collateral.\nThus, suppose that firms are using land as a form of collateral, and land falls in value by 20%. Then, some firms will be forced to forgo projects that they would have otherwise undertaken. The quantity of investment will fall. Perhaps more surprisingly, the equilibrium interest rate will fall. Intuitively, borrowers’ demand for loans is capped by the market value of collateral. A fall in the market value of collateral leads to a fall in loan demand. To equilibrate markets, the supply of loans must also fall—and that can only happen if interest rates decline.\nThere are a number of useful policy responses to collateral shocks of this kind. The problem is that firms don’t have enough collateral. Suppose that the government gives Treasury debt to all firms. Those with good projects now have a source of funding: They can sell their Treasury debt (or borrow against it). Of course, creating this new Treasury debt means that the government must tax in the future. However, as long as the credit constraint is sufficiently tight, the social losses created by this taxation are less than the gains generated by loosening the firms’ borrowing constraints.1\nOn the other hand, some seemingly useful policy responses are ineffective. Lowering the fed funds rate (and thereby the real interest rate) cannot generate more investment. Loan demand is constrained by the availability of collateral, not by the cost of funds to borrowers. Indeed, the above policy response (handing out more government debt to firms) necessarily raises interest rates.\nBanks are firms, and so a good response may well require handing out Treasury debt to banks. Nonetheless, it may not be effective to give Treasury debt only to banks (as opposed to all firms). Banks will not be able to use this source of funds to make loans if firms are collateral-constrained.\nAsymmetric Information\nFirms may have private information about their projects or their collateral. This private information confronts lenders with an extra form of risk and constrains their willingness to lend. Correspondingly, increases in private information lead to falls in the amount of lending and to spikes in the spreads between corporate lending rates and default-free Treasuries. Indeed, in extremis, private information problems can actually shut down lending entirely.\nThe government’s ability to respond to this friction depends critically on its level of information. If a government has no more information than lenders, then the government must lose money on any program that seeks to expand the scope of lending. (If this were not true, then lenders would have adopted that same program.) At least in this sense, taxpayers are made worse off by government interventions.\nHowever, in some markets, governments may well have superior information to lenders. For example, through the bank supervision process, the Federal Reserve acquires a great deal of information that is not shared with markets. With this extra information, the Federal Reserve can safely lend through the discount window to potential borrowers at a lower rate than the borrowers would receive in private markets. There is a valuable synergy between the Fed’s role in bank supervision and its ability to intervene usefully in interbank lending markets.\nIlliquidity\nFinancial markets vary in their liquidity. In liquid markets, a seller gets the same price per unit regardless of the quantity sold or the speed of sale. In illiquid markets, selling rapidly or selling a lot leads to large price per unit declines relative to selling slowly or selling little.\nLiquidity shows up in asset prices and can influence allocations of real resources. For example, agency mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are guaranteed against default risk. But they still contain prepayment risk. The buyers of agency MBSs can usually diversify much of this risk by selling the asset. Now imagine, though, that the secondary markets for agency MBSs become much less liquid. Buyers of agency MBSs cannot diversify away the associated prepayment risk, and so demand a higher yield per unit of risk held. (Technically, we say that the market price of agency MBS prepayment risk rises.) Agency MBS risk premia rise, and home buyers end up facing higher mortgage rates.\nThe government can respond usefully to such an event. Suppose that the government buys a large amount of MBSs. Their generated flow of income will not greatly affect the government’s revenue stream, and so the government faces relatively little additional risk by buying the MBSs. However, buyers now have to hold a lot less risk in the form of agency MBSs. The market price of agency MBS prepayment risk declines. This form of government intervention is desirable because the government can cheaply diversify its position, while a private agent cannot.\nIf the market remains illiquid, then government sales of agency MBSs would lead to increases in their risk premium (because MBS buyers are forced to hold more risk). But eventually, the agency MBS market will become liquid once more. At this point, the government can reverse its operation and sell its MBSs in secondary markets without affecting their risk premium.\nHow Do We See the Frictions in the Data?\nI have talked about three frictions and the associated policy responses. Admittedly, the frictions almost certainly overlap to a greater extent than my discussion implies. For example, markets may well become more illiquid when collateral constraints tighten and/or private information problems worsen.\nBut, in general, these are three distinct frictions with three distinct policy responses. A single FCI cannot capture their separate fluctuations. To understand appropriate policy responses, one needs to identify (at least) three distinct financial condition factors (FCFs).\nI think that the authors do a useful first step in this direction. In Table 5.2, they distinguish several FCFs based on subsets of their 44 data series. They document that these FCFs do not have superior predictive performance relative to their preferred FCI. However, this exercise could be made even more useful by using theoretical considerations to map various kinds of credit market frictions into distinct choices of subsets of variables.\nMy discussion of the various frictions provides some initial insights into how we can determine their relative severity using financial markets data. For all of them, of course, we should see loan quantities decline. How else would they show up in financial markets data?\nFriction 1 (collateral): Collateral prices fall, and interest rates decline. Credit market risk spreads do not change.\nFriction 2 (private information): Credit market spreads increase, and loan standards tighten.\nFriction 3 (illiquidity): The market price of a given asset’s risk rises.\nI have to say that separate frictions are probably not essential in thinking about the period from late 2007 through mid-2009. It seems clear—both from the authors’ work and from more casual empiricism—that all three of these frictions increased greatly in severity during this period.\nBut the current picture is murkier. I would certainly say that at this point, credit market spreads are sufficiently low that friction 2 seems hardly relevant. It is harder to tell about friction 3. The market price of agency MBS prepayment risk has fallen, but this decline may well be due to the large Fed holdings of agency MBSs.\nBut net borrowing remains low. This indicates to me that friction 1—low borrowing capacity because of collateral constraints—may still be significant. Both short-term and medium-term real interest rates (as measured by TIPS bonds) are low relative to their historical averages. Land is an important source of collateral, and its price remains low. (More generally, as of 2009:3, nonfinancial noncorporate net worth is down about 17% from 2007.) It is true that credit market spreads have vanished, but this is not a relevant consideration when thinking about friction 1.\nIt is exactly this kind of analysis that makes me think that using multiple FCFs to gauge financial market conditions might be so important. This point is reinforced by the recent behavior of the eight FCIs in the authors’ paper. The first seven all rose in the second half of 2009, but the authors’ own FCI fell. Clearly, there are at least two distinct factors responsible for these movements. My message is that knowing these distinct factors matters for understanding how policymakers should respond to worsening financial market conditions.\nConclusions\nIn many ways, my remarks parallel the sophisticated discussion of financial market imperfections in the introduction to this paper. To use their language, the authors point out that our modeling of such imperfections is still rudimentary. They argue that this state of play means that one has to use reduced-form statistical techniques to create FCIs.\nI agree with them that the extant modeling is rudimentary, and it is likely to remain so for some time. Nonetheless, even these simple models have important insights. I hope that these model-based insights become more central in future attempts to construct measures of strains in financial markets.\n1 These social gains exist because the government has a power that private lenders do not. The collateral constraint exists because borrowers can divert profits before repaying lenders. Governments can impose sales and other taxes that seize firm revenues before they can be diverted.\n\nPaper: Financial Conditions Indexes: A Fresh Look after the Financial Crisis [PDF] (from the 2010 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum)\n\nIn this paper, the authors construct a new financial conditions index (FCI).

These costs mean that interventions are certainly inappropriate when the frictions are relatively small in size.\n\nCollateral\nIn frictionless credit markets, firms are fully able to capitalize their flow of future profits. In practice, lenders realize that borrowers may be able to hide or divert profits. As a result, a firm’s borrowing capacity is generally affected by the market value of its holdings of collateral. Appropriate notions of collateral vary from context to context. However, whatever their form, collateral requirements impose a connection between a firm’s ability to borrow and the market value of its collateral.\n\nThus, suppose that firms are using land as a form of collateral, and land falls in value by 20%. Then, some firms will be forced to forgo projects that they would have otherwise undertaken. The quantity of investment will fall. Perhaps more surprisingly, the equilibrium interest rate will fall. Intuitively, borrowers’ demand for loans is capped by the market value of collateral. A fall in the market value of collateral leads to a fall in loan demand. To equilibrate markets, the supply of loans must also fall—and that can only happen if interest rates decline.\n\nThere are a number of useful policy responses to collateral shocks of this kind. The problem is that firms don’t have enough collateral. Suppose that the government gives Treasury debt to all firms. Those with good projects now have a source of funding: They can sell their Treasury debt (or borrow against it). Of course, creating this new Treasury debt means that the government must tax in the future. However, as long as the credit constraint is sufficiently tight, the social losses created by this taxation are less than the gains generated by loosening the firms’ borrowing constraints.1\n\nOn the other hand, some seemingly useful policy responses are ineffective. Lowering the fed funds rate (and thereby the real interest rate) cannot generate more investment. Loan demand is constrained by the availability of collateral, not by the cost of funds to borrowers. Indeed, the above policy response (handing out more government debt to firms) necessarily raises interest rates.\n\nBanks are firms, and so a good response may well require handing out Treasury debt to banks. Nonetheless, it may not be effective to give Treasury debt only to banks (as opposed to all firms). Banks will not be able to use this source of funds to make loans if firms are collateral-constrained.\n\nAsymmetric Information\nFirms may have private information about their projects or their collateral. This private information confronts lenders with an extra form of risk and constrains their willingness to lend. Correspondingly, increases in private information lead to falls in the amount of lending and to spikes in the spreads between corporate lending rates and default-free Treasuries. Indeed, in extremis, private information problems can actually shut down lending entirely.\n\nThe government’s ability to respond to this friction depends critically on its level of information. If a government has no more information than lenders, then the government must lose money on any program that seeks to expand the scope of lending. (If this were not true, then lenders would have adopted that same program.) At least in this sense, taxpayers are made worse off by government interventions.\n\nHowever, in some markets, governments may well have superior information to lenders. For example, through the bank supervision process, the Federal Reserve acquires a great deal of information that is not shared with markets. With this extra information, the Federal Reserve can safely lend through the discount window to potential borrowers at a lower rate than the borrowers would receive in private markets. There is a valuable synergy between the Fed’s role in bank supervision and its ability to intervene usefully in interbank lending markets.\n\nIlliquidity\nFinancial markets vary in their liquidity. In liquid markets, a seller gets the same price per unit regardless of the quantity sold or the speed of sale. In illiquid markets, selling rapidly or selling a lot leads to large price per unit declines relative to selling slowly or selling little.\n\nLiquidity shows up in asset prices and can influence allocations of real resources. For example, agency mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are guaranteed against default risk. But they still contain prepayment risk. The buyers of agency MBSs can usually diversify much of this risk by selling the asset. Now imagine, though, that the secondary markets for agency MBSs become much less liquid. Buyers of agency MBSs cannot diversify away the associated prepayment risk, and so demand a higher yield per unit of risk held. (Technically, we say that the market price of agency MBS prepayment risk rises.) Agency MBS risk premia rise, and home buyers end up facing higher mortgage rates.\n\nThe government can respond usefully to such an event. Suppose that the government buys a large amount of MBSs. Their generated flow of income will not greatly affect the government’s revenue stream, and so the government faces relatively little additional risk by buying the MBSs. However, buyers now have to hold a lot less risk in the form of agency MBSs. The market price of agency MBS prepayment risk declines. This form of government intervention is desirable because the government can cheaply diversify its position, while a private agent cannot.\n\nIf the market remains illiquid, then government sales of agency MBSs would lead to increases in their risk premium (because MBS buyers are forced to hold more risk). But eventually, the agency MBS market will become liquid once more. At this point, the government can reverse its operation and sell its MBSs in secondary markets without affecting their risk premium.\n\nI have talked about three frictions and the associated policy responses. Admittedly, the frictions almost certainly overlap to a greater extent than my discussion implies. For example, markets may well become more illiquid when collateral constraints tighten and/or private information problems worsen.\n\nBut, in general, these are three distinct frictions with three distinct policy responses. A single FCI cannot capture their separate fluctuations. To understand appropriate policy responses, one needs to identify (at least) three distinct financial condition factors (FCFs).\n\nI think that the authors do a useful first step in this direction. In Table 5.2, they distinguish several FCFs based on subsets of their 44 data series. They document that these FCFs do not have superior predictive performance relative to their preferred FCI. However, this exercise could be made even more useful by using theoretical considerations to map various kinds of credit market frictions into distinct choices of subsets of variables.\n\nMy discussion of the various frictions provides some initial insights into how we can determine their relative severity using financial markets data. For all of them, of course, we should see loan quantities decline. How else would they show up in financial markets data?\n\nFriction 1 (collateral): Collateral prices fall, and interest rates decline. Credit market risk spreads do not change.\n\nFriction 2 (private information): Credit market spreads increase, and loan standards tighten.\n\nFriction 3 (illiquidity): The market price of a given asset’s risk rises.\n\nI have to say that separate frictions are probably not essential in thinking about the period from late 2007 through mid-2009. It seems clear—both from the authors’ work and from more casual empiricism—that all three of these frictions increased greatly in severity during this period.\n\nBut the current picture is murkier. I would certainly say that at this point, credit market spreads are sufficiently low that friction 2 seems hardly relevant. It is harder to tell about friction 3. The market price of agency MBS prepayment risk has fallen, but this decline may well be due to the large Fed holdings of agency MBSs.\n\nBut net borrowing remains low. This indicates to me that friction 1—low borrowing capacity because of collateral constraints—may still be significant. Both short-term and medium-term real interest rates (as measured by TIPS bonds) are low relative to their historical averages. Land is an important source of collateral, and its price remains low. (More generally, as of 2009:3, nonfinancial noncorporate net worth is down about 17% from 2007.) It is true that credit market spreads have vanished, but this is not a relevant consideration when thinking about friction 1.\n\nIt is exactly this kind of analysis that makes me think that using multiple FCFs to gauge financial market conditions might be so important. This point is reinforced by the recent behavior of the eight FCIs in the authors’ paper. The first seven all rose in the second half of 2009, but the authors’ own FCI fell. Clearly, there are at least two distinct factors responsible for these movements. My message is that knowing these distinct factors matters for understanding how policymakers should respond to worsening financial market conditions.\n\nIn many ways, my remarks parallel the sophisticated discussion of financial market imperfections in the introduction to this paper. To use their language, the authors point out that our modeling of such imperfections is still rudimentary. They argue that this state of play means that one has to use reduced-form statistical techniques to create FCIs.\n\nI agree with them that the extant modeling is rudimentary, and it is likely to remain so for some time. Nonetheless, even these simple models have important insights. I hope that these model-based insights become more central in future attempts to construct measures of strains in financial markets.\n\n1 These social gains exist because the government has a power that private lenders do not. The collateral constraint exists because borrowers can divert profits before repaying lenders. Governments can impose sales and other taxes that seize firm revenues before they can be diverted."

            "content": "Introduction\nGood afternoon. It is a distinct pleasure to be back in Helena, to have another opportunity to share some thoughts about the state of and prospects for our economy, about risks to economic progress going forward, and about proposals for reform of the regulatory and supervisory apparatus governing financial institutions. By way of preview, my principal conclusions with regard to these matters are: 1) while this has been a long, broad, and deep recession, the first stage of recovery of the economy is close at hand; 2) although there are concerns about a potential burst of inflation, owing to considerable liquidity provision by the Federal Reserve during the recession and financial crisis, this is not likely in my judgment to pose a major threat to the economy. More worrisome in the longer-term is the possibility of renewed volatility in asset prices; 3) finally, while regulatory reform is essential and the Treasury's recent proposal is a start, the document fails to deal adequately with the too-big-to-fail problem and therefore, unless strengthened, will leave the financial system susceptible to future bouts of resource misallocation and serious instability.\nHaving, I hope, piqued your curiosity, I will devote the remainder of my remarks to describing the basis for these conclusions. But before proceeding, I will remind you that as always I am speaking only for myself and not for others in the Federal Reserve.\nThe Economy\nAs you are no doubt well aware, the national economy has experienced a serious recession which began over a year and a half ago, in December 2007. The downturn in business activity has been broad, deep, and prolonged. Most industries and virtually every region of the country have been affected; the recession has, moreover, been global in nature. In this country, employment has declined appreciably during the contraction (by more than 6 million jobs), and unemployment has climbed to 9.5 percent of the labor force, the highest level since 1983.\nDespite a fairly continuous stream of negative news, I continue to think that improvement in the economy is close at hand. At economic turning points—when activity moves from recession to positive growth, for example—the data are inevitably mixed, and there now are in fact positive signs of stabilization in consumer spending, manufacturing activity, and various measures of residential real estate activity, including the volume of home sales and starts of single-family units. Moreover, adjustments which typically occur in a contraction ultimately help to lay the foundation for renewed growth. For example, as business reduces output and employment, at some point aggregate supply falls below even the subdued level of demand, inventories shrink, and the reduction in stocks leads ultimately to increases in hours worked, new hiring, and a general pickup in the economy. This inventory adjustment process is well under way.\nPerhaps more fundamentally, considerable fiscal policy stimulus is in train and monetary policy has been aggressively expansionary as well. Interest rates are low, and financial conditions have demonstrably improved. While it is difficult to judge these things with precision, it now appears that credit expansion is being constrained roughly as much by subdued demand as by tight supply. In any event, credit is more readily available to households and businesses today than it was just a few months ago.\nOnce the economic recovery begins, its pace is likely to be quite modest for a time. There is historical precedent for this, as evidenced by the first stages of both the expansion of the 1990s and the one earlier this decade. In view of the negative wealth effects stemming from declines in home and equity values, still strained credit conditions, considerable excess capacity across the economy, and sizable job losses to date, it seems a reasonable bet that it will take time for momentum to build. It is also likely to take a considerable period for the labor market to recover, as employment may well continue to decrease in finance, autos, and construction, for example, even as it picks up elsewhere. It is worth recalling in this regard that the unemployment rate peaked 15 months into the expansion of the 1990s and 19 months into this decade's expansion. In any event, with the passage of time—as we move into the middle of next year and beyond—I would expect to see a resumption of healthy growth.\nInflation and Asset Prices\nNumerous analysts have recently been expressing the concern that, notwithstanding the large amount of slack in the economy, there is the threat of a serious burst of inflation owing to the huge expansion of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, from about $1 trillion in size last September to more than $2 trillion today. This is to be sure an impressive and, I might add, justified increase in liquidity, but there is nothing inevitable about a surge in prices. The Federal Reserve is fully capable of shrinking its balance sheet and withdrawing liquidity when it is appropriate to do so. Without question, it will be difficult to know both when to begin such action and how rapidly to proceed, but this is always the case. That is, in my experience it is always a challenge for policymakers to know when to begin to tighten policy and by how much to do so.\nThis challenge, however, is not a cause for despair. If one examines the inflation record of the United States, and of many other industrial economies for that matter, since the early 1980s, it appears that central banks have largely succeeded in delivering diminishing and, ultimately, low inflation. I can think of no reason why this cannot continue.\nMore worrisome to me is the potential—I would emphasize that at some point in the future—for further, sharp volatility in asset prices, where the Federal Reserve does not have a track record of success in curbing excesses. In my view, asset prices should play a greater role in policy deliberations and decisions than currently is the case. While policymakers have acknowledged that asset price excesses and their subsequent correction can potentially have meaningful consequences for the economy, they generally have preferred to try to cushion the repercussions of an asset price collapse rather than to address an asset price run-up in its early stages. There are in fact good reasons for this attitude, having to do with the difficulty of identifying asset 'bubbles' in a timely way, the need to build public support for action, and the challenge of weighing the costs and benefits of action for the broad economy. Nevertheless, in view of the damage resulting from the decline in housing values, as well as the aftermath of the collapse of prices of technology stocks earlier this decade, I think it essential to revisit these issues.\nIdentification of excesses in asset prices, although challenging, does not appear to be beyond the realm of possibility. There is some work in academic circles, and at least some practitioners agree, that when common ratios (the ratio of stock prices to earnings or dividends, for example, or the ratio of housing values to rents) exceed the bounds of historical experience, it is likely that a price correction will follow, although its timing is unpredictable. It would seem likely that misidentification will occur occasionally and, in particular, that some events may be classified as bubbles when they are not. The implication of this possibility is, in my view, to ensure that the policy response to a perceived excess in asset prices is measured, so that even if in error the ramifications for the economy will be modest.\nThis consideration illustrates, perhaps, the critical issue in addressing asset price excesses. When all is said and done, will the benefits outweigh the costs, assuming policymakers have made the correct identification? Monetary policy, for which we in the Federal Reserve are responsible, is a blunt instrument with economywide effects. We should not pretend that actions taken to rein in those asset price increases which seemingly outstrip economic fundamentals won't in the short run curtail to some extent economic growth and employment; after all, such actions are likely to require raising interest rates earlier and probably more than otherwise would be the case. There is a trade-off here, involving short-run costs in exchange for the benefits of greater stability and growth in the long run. Before taking action, policymakers need to weigh these elements carefully.\nFurther, monetary policy is not made in a vacuum; the central bank must have public support for the actions it pursues, and it is easy to imagine resistance to concerns about asset price levels. Nevertheless, as the anti-inflation experience of 1979-82, for example, illustrates, it is possible to build considerable support (as Paul Volcker did), or at least tolerance, for policies that some considered risky and unappealing.\nRegulatory Reform\nThe Treasury has recently come forward with an ambitious proposal to reform the regulatory and supervisory apparatus governing much of the financial services industry. I will not attempt a comprehensive review of the proposal here; instead, let me concentrate on a critical public policy issue and provide an assessment of the Treasury's response to this matter.\nThe issue in question is too-big-to-fail (TBTF), now widely if belatedly acknowledged as an exceedingly costly problem. While not constituting \"proof,\" it is striking that most of the losses suffered to date during the financial crisis have been at the largest institutions operating in the country.\nI have in fact spoken and written extensively—some might say obsessively—about TBTF over the past five years. In 2004, I co-authored (with my Federal Reserve colleague Ron Feldman) a book on the subject titled Too-Big-to-Fail: The Hazards of Bank Bailouts, just rereleased in paperback by the Brookings Institution. I think it fair to say that Feldman and I, unlike most other policymakers and analysts, recognized in a timely way that TBTF was a severe and growing problem, that it had not been addressed effectively by the FDICIA legislation of 1991, and that it would eventually and inevitably lead to excessive risk-taking, turmoil in financial markets, and disruption in the economy. It is also revealing that there is considerable overlap between the 19 large banking organizations just put through the \"stress test\" and the list of TBTF institutions Feldman and I identified in 2004.\nI think an important question is: How is it that we put high priority on the growing TBTF problem and its ramifications when others did not? The short and direct answer to this question is that we focused on understanding the incentives of uninsured creditors of large, complex financial institutions, the incentives of management of such institutions, and the incentives of policymakers responsible for economic and financial stability. And we understood the implications of such incentives.\nThe bottom line of our analysis is that creditors of such complex financial institutions expected, on the basis of relatively well-established precedents and on an understanding of policymakers' motivations, protection if failure threatened. As a consequence, they had at most modest incentive to be concerned about the condition and prospects of these large institutions, leading to underpricing of risk-taking in the market place. With risk underpriced, these institutions took on excessive amounts of it, leading eventually to the precarious position of some of them. And policymakers, fearing massive, negative spillover effects to other institutions, financial markets more generally, and the economy itself, provided protection and validated creditor expectations.\nThis emphasis on incentives is not accidental. To the contrary, I am convinced that just as incentives were at the heart of the TBTF problem, they necessarily must be at the heart of the solution. That is, any proposal which purports to correct TBTF must address the incentives which lead to the problem. The program that Feldman and I have advocated, which is called systemic focused supervision and is described in detail in several previous speeches, is intended to do precisely that.\nThe Treasury proposal, on the other hand, largely fails in this regard. In fact, I would describe the Treasury plan as it pertains specifically to TBTF as \"status quo plus\"—more capital, more liquidity, better supervision, far-reaching resolution authority for the largest institutions. There is little reason to think that these steps will, individually or collectively, succeed in reining in TBTF effectively over time because they do not change the incentives which create the problem. In fact, there is nothing in the Treasury proposal designed to put creditors of large, systemically important financial institutions at risk of loss.\nConclusion\nLet me reiterate just a few points, in concluding these remarks. First, although the labor market continues to deteriorate, I think that the first stage of economic recovery is close at hand, largely because the inventory liquidation process is proceeding as anticipated and because there are signs of stabilization in consumer spending, manufacturing, and some measures of housing activity. Second, while some have expressed considerable concern about inflation prospects in view of the expansion of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, a more likely threat at some future point is renewed volatility in asset prices, where the Federal Reserve lacks a record of success in providing stability. And finally, while regulatory reform is appropriate at this juncture, the Treasury proposal fails to come to grips with TBTF and therefore leaves the financial system considerably more vulnerable than it needs to be to future bouts of instability.\n\nGood afternoon.

And finally, while regulatory reform is appropriate at this juncture, the Treasury proposal fails to come to grips with TBTF and therefore leaves the financial system considerably more vulnerable than it needs to be to future bouts of instability."

            "content": "Introduction\nAbout two weeks ago, I had the opportunity to testify before the Senate Banking Committee on policies to address the too-big-to-fail (TBTF) problem. TBTF is a critical public policy issue, and I will offer further comments on the topic shortly. Indeed, my plan this afternoon is to cover a broad range of issues, including progress toward restoration of financial stability, policies essential to reducing the probability of future financial crises, the current state of the economy, and the economic outlook. There should be time for questions and discussion, and I will remind you that, as always, I am speaking only for myself and not for others in the Federal Reserve.\nFinancial Institutions and Markets\nBeginning about 21 months ago, financial markets were rocked by a series of shocks which ultimately had global implications and whose repercussions remain significant to this day. While conditions in credit markets generally have improved over the past several months, perceptible strains persist. The improvement we have witnessed appears to be due, in part, to the aggressive policy response of the Federal Reserve as well as programs introduced by the Treasury and FDIC.\nThe Federal Reserve, in particular, has reduced short-term interest rates significantly, worked to improve liquidity both in important markets and for a range of financial institutions, and purchased longer-term debt instruments in volume in order to decrease those rates as well. Reflecting the scale of these actions, the Federal Reserve balance sheet has increased from about $1 trillion last September to something in excess of $2 trillion now. While it is still too early to fully tally results, there has been progress, and I anticipate further improvement in credit conditions as select programs become fully operational, participation increases, and confidence picks up.\nThe Role of the Financial System\nA healthy, smoothly functioning financial system is essential to sustained economic growth, because businesses and households alike require the ability to finance projects at competitive terms and conditions, be they investment in plant and equipment or purchases of homes and durable goods. Right now, the financial system remains impaired, and there is considerable rhetoric about a so-called credit crunch. To be sure, some borrowers are encountering substantial difficulty in obtaining funding, but conversations with numerous bankers and their customers reveal a diverse set of circumstances, ranging from “business as usual” on the one hand to appreciable credit restriction on the other. One size clearly does not fit all, and it is important to recognize that the demand for credit from some sectors appears to have diminished, and its composition has shifted as well.\nBesides a role in financing investment, there are other compelling reasons why restoration of sound financial institutions and markets is of the highest priority. Markets that are impaired obviously do not provide robust prices for the financial instruments that normally trade on them, and such pricing is critical to resource allocation and reallocation. In particular, the reallocation of resources that should occur in a recession and that is fundamental to economic recovery is inhibited when financial markets are not functioning or are functioning poorly. Unless conditions improve, such market failures threaten to prolong the recession.\nFurther, the commercial banking system has long been thought of, and indeed has served as, a principal backup source of liquidity for many other financial institutions and markets. Banks continue to play this role but, for a variety of reasons, it has become more challenging to do so. For one thing, the so-called shadow banking system grew rapidly relative to the traditional banking sector over the past two decades or so. And now the demands on the banks from these nonbank financial institutions are that much greater, making it difficult for banks to respond adequately to all customers. Restoration of a healthy banking system would help to mitigate this problem.\nToo-Big-to-Fail\nIn view of the severity of the financial disruptions of the past 21 months, it is essential that we begin immediately to give serious thought to avoiding a recurrence of these events and to addressing the too-big-to-fail issue, now widely if belatedly acknowledged as an exceedingly costly problem. While not constituting “proof,” it is striking that most of the losses suffered to date during the financial crisis have been at the largest institutions operating in the country.\nI have in fact spoken and written extensively—some might say obsessively—about TBTF over the past five years. In 2004, I co-authored (with my colleague Ron Feldman) a book on the subject titled Too-Big-to-Fail: The Hazards of Bank Bailouts, just rereleased in paperback by the Brookings Institution. I think it fair to say that Feldman and I, unlike most other policymakers and analysts, recognized in a timely way that TBTF was a severe and growing problem, that it had not been addressed effectively by the FDICIA legislation of 1991, and that it would eventually and inevitably lead to excessive risk-taking, turmoil in financial markets, and disruption in the economy. It is also revealing that there is considerable overlap between the 19 large banking organizations just put through the “stress test” and the list of TBTF institutions Feldman and I identified in 2004.\nI think an important question is: How is it that we put high priority on the growing TBTF problem and its ramifications when others did not? The short and direct answer to this question is that we focused on understanding the incentives of uninsured creditors of large, complex financial institutions, the incentives of management of such institutions, and the incentives of policymakers responsible for economic and financial stability. And we understood the implications of such incentives.\nThe bottom line of our analysis is that creditors of such complex financial institutions expected, on the basis of relatively well-established precedents and on an understanding of policymakers' motivations, protection if failure threatened. As a consequence, they had at most modest incentive to be concerned about the condition and prospects of these large institutions, leading to underpricing of risk-taking. With risk underpriced, these institutions took on excessive amounts of it, leading eventually to the precarious position of some of them. And policymakers, fearing massive, negative spillover effects to other institutions, financial markets more generally, and the economy itself, provided protection and validated creditor expectations.\nThis emphasis on incentives is not merely historical background. To the contrary, I am convinced that just as incentives were at the heart of the TBTF problem, they necessarily must be at the heart of the solution. Our proposal to correct TBTF, called systemic focused supervision (SFS), is designed to better align incentives so as to significantly reduce both the TBTF problem and the probability of future episodes of major instability. The keys to this are, in fact, reforms which make policymakers confident that they need not intervene if a large institution encounters difficulty and to put creditors on notice that they are likely to experience losses in such circumstances.\nRather than review the specifics of SFS this afternoon—they are described in many of my speeches of the past eight months—let me instead speculate a bit about the possible course of action with regard to the risk-taking of large, complex financial institutions. I would think that such institutions may well, in the future, be subject to higher capital requirements, “taxes” on activities that pose systemic risk, and a bank-like resolution regime to help contain spillovers. Among other things, such steps would help to level the playing field between TBTF firms and community-oriented financial organizations. However, I am deeply concerned that proposals which purport to address TBTF, but which fail to correct incentives, will prove to be less than fully successful. In particular, proposals to “shrink” the largest financial institutions or to rely on heightened regulation and supervision of and increased capital for such institutions do not address the fundamental problem.\nThe Economy\nLet me turn now to the state of the economy and its prospects. As you are no doubt well aware, the national economy is in the midst of a serious recession which began about a year and a half ago, a downturn which has affected most industries and virtually every region of the country. The recession, moreover, is global in nature. In this country, employment has declined significantly during the contraction in activity, and the unemployment rate has climbed to 8.9 percent nationwide.\nGiven the breadth of the downturn, it is difficult at this stage to identify with conviction the engine, or engines, of expansion that will propel the recovery of the national economy. In my experience, this is always the case in the midst of recession. Still, I continue to think that improvement in business activity is not far off. Interest rates are low and financial conditions are improving; the improvement is gradually becoming more broadly based. Major fiscal policy stimulus is under way and should add to aggregate demand in a timely way unless consumers and businesses turn exceedingly cautious.\nMoreover, adjustments which typically occur in a contraction ultimately help to lay the foundation for renewed growth. For example, as business continues to reduce output and employment, inventories shrink, and at some point aggregate supply falls below even the diminished level of demand, leading to increases in hours worked, net new hiring, and a general pickup in activity. There are, moreover, signs that consumer spending is in the process of stabilizing after its sharp decline during the second half of last year; indeed, consumer spending increased in the first quarter, according to the recently released GDP report. And progress is under way in working off the inventory of unsold, unoccupied homes and condos.\nOnce the economic recovery begins, the pace of the expansion is likely to be subdued for a time. There is historical precedent for this, since the recovery of the early 1990s was initially quite modest, as was the recovery earlier this decade. More importantly, in view of the state of the credit markets and the decline in the value of equities and homes, it seems a fair bet that it will take time for momentum to build. But with the passage of time—as we get into the middle of 2010 and beyond—I would expect to see a resumption of healthy growth.\nIt is also likely to take some time for labor market conditions to improve meaningfully. Again, there is ample precedent for this and, more fundamentally, employment may well continue to fall in industries which are contracting—finance, construction, autos—even as it picks up elsewhere.\nWhat of the outlook for inflation? Concerns today appear to have coalesced around two competing perspectives, namely: (1) concern for future inflation, stemming from the Federal Reserve's provision of huge amounts of liquidity in response to the financial crisis; (2) deflation, resulting presumably from the downturn in global economic activity and the concomitant increase in excess capacity.\nNeither concern can be readily dismissed but, if economic growth resumes in the United States as I expect, the threat of deflation should diminish commensurately. And to date, there is scant evidence of deflation in so-called core measures of inflation. As for liquidity provision and inflation, it is important to emphasize that the relation between growth in the money supply and the path of prices holds in the long run, over periods of at least five and more likely 10 years. Thus, there is ample time for the Federal Reserve to withdraw excess liquidity, although to be sure, policymakers will have to be acutely sensitive to acting as soon as appropriate.\nAsset Prices\nA few moments ago, I alluded to the decrease in home and equity values and its implications for near-term business activity. Changes in home and equity prices, two principal items on the household balance sheet, exert so-called wealth effects on consumer spending, which is to say that while such spending depends mainly on after-tax income, wealth influences outlays as well. While policymakers have acknowledged that asset price excesses and their subsequent correction can potentially have meaningful consequences for the economy, they generally have preferred to try to cushion the repercussions of an asset price collapse rather than to address an asset price run-up in its early stages. There are good reasons for this attitude, having to do with the difficulty of identifying asset “bubbles” in a timely way, the need to build public support for action, and the challenge of weighing the costs and benefits of action for the broad economy. Nevertheless, in view of the damage resulting from the decline in housing values, as well as the aftermath of the collapse of prices of technology stocks earlier this decade, I think it essential to revisit these issues.\nIdentification of excesses in asset prices, although challenging, does not appear to be beyond the realm of possibility. There is some work in academic circles, and at least some practitioners agree, that when common ratios (the ratio of stock prices to earnings or dividends, for example, or the ratio of housing values to rents) exceed the bounds of historical experience, it is likely that a price correction will follow, although its timing is unpredictable. It would seem likely that misidentification will occur occasionally and, in particular, that some events may be classified as bubbles when they are not. The implication of this possibility is, in my view, to ensure that the policy response to a perceived excess in asset prices is measured, so that even if in error the ramifications for the economy will be modest.\nThis consideration illustrates, perhaps, the critical issue in addressing asset price excesses. When all is said and done, will the benefits outweigh the costs, assuming policymakers have made the correct identification? Monetary policy, for which we in the Federal Reserve are responsible, is a blunt instrument with economywide effects. We should not pretend that actions taken to rein in those asset price increases which seemingly outstrip economic fundamentals won't in the short run curtail to some extent economic growth and employment; after all, such actions are likely to require raising interest rates earlier and probably more than otherwise would be the case. There is a trade-off here, involving short-run costs in exchange for the benefits of greater stability and growth in the long run. Before taking action, policymakers need to weigh these elements carefully.\nFurther, monetary policy is not made in a vacuum; the central bank must have public support for the actions it pursues, and it is easy to imagine resistance to concerns about asset price levels. Nevertheless, as the anti-inflation experience of 1979-82, for example, illustrates, it is possible to build considerable support (as Paul Volcker did), or at least tolerance, for policies that some considered risky and unappealing.\nConclusion\nLet me reiterate just a few points, in wrapping up these remarks. First, appreciable financial strains persist, and credit issues are likely to weigh on the economy for some time. Overall, it is essential to restore the health of financial institutions and markets, so that long-lived projects can be financed, so that resource reallocation is facilitated, and so that liquidity improves. In part as a consequence of the state of the credit markets, the recession is likely to persist for several more months, and the initial stage of the recovery seems likely to be subdued. Nevertheless, in view of the policies already in place here and abroad, a resumption of growth should not be too far off, especially given the economy's fundamental resilience. Before long, attention will appropriately turn to banking issues and policies, and especially to addressing the vexing issue of TBTF. This effort should be among our highest priorities and should focus on correcting the incentives that contributed to the problem and the instability that followed from it. And policymakers also should begin to reconsider their attitude toward excesses in asset prices because it has proven exceedingly difficult and costly to deal with the aftermath of such excesses.\n\nAbout two weeks ago, I had the opportunity to testify before the Senate Banking Committee on policies to address the too-big-to-fail (TBTF) problem.

            "content": "Chairman Dodd, Ranking Member Shelby, and members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to review the too big to fail (TBTF) problem with you today. I will develop a simple conclusion in this testimony: The key to addressing TBTF is to reduce substantially the negative spillover effects stemming from the failure of a systemically important financial institution. Let me explain how I have come to that conclusion.\nThe TBTF problem is one of undesirable incentives which we need to address if we hope to fix the problem. TBTF arises, by definition, when the uninsured creditors of systemically important financial institutions expect government protection from loss when these financial institutions get into financial or operational trouble. The key to addressing this problem and changing incentives, therefore, is to convince these creditors that they are at risk of loss. If creditors continue to expect special protection, the moral hazard of government protection will continue. That is, the creditors will continue to underprice the risk-taking of these financial institutions, overfund them, and fail to provide effective market discipline Facing prices that are too low, systemically important firms will take on too much risk. Excessive risk-taking squanders valuable economic resources and, in the extreme, leads to financial crises that impose substantial losses on taxpayers. Put another way, if policymakers do not address TBTF, the United States likely will endure an inefficient financial system, slower economic growth, and lower living standards than otherwise would be the case.\nTo address TBTF, policymakers must change these incentives, and I recommend the following steps to achieve that goal. And let me emphasize that these are my personal views.\nFirst, identify why policymakers provide protection to uninsured creditors. If we do not address the underlying rationale for providing protection, we will not credibly put creditors of systemically important firms at risk of loss. The threat of financial spillovers leads policymakers to provide such protection.1 Indeed, I would define systemically important financial institutions by the potential that their financial and operational weaknesses can spill over to other financial institutions, capital markets, and the rest of the economy. As a result, my recommendations to address the TBTF problem focus on mitigating the perceived and real fallout from financial spillovers.\nSecond, enact reforms to reduce the perceived or real threat of the spillovers that motivate after-the fact protection of uninsured creditors. These reforms include, but are not limited to, increased supervisory focus on preparation for the potential failure of a large financial institution, enhanced prompt corrective action, and better communication of efforts to put creditors of systemically important firms at risk of loss. I call this combination of reforms systemic focused supervision (SFS). Other reforms outside of SFS will help address TBTF as well. I also recommend, for example, capital regimes that automatically provide increased protection against loss during bad times and insurance premiums that raise the cost for financial institution activities that create spillovers. I recognize the substantial benefits of highlighting a single reform that would fix TBTF, but I believe a variety of steps are required to credibly take on TBTF.2\nThird, be careful about relying heavily on reforms that do not materially reduce spillovers. In particular, I do not think that intensification of traditional supervision and regulation of large financial firms will effectively address the TBTF problem. In a similar vein, while I support the creation of a new resolution regime for systemically important nonbank financial institutions, I would augment the new resolution regime with the types of reforms I just noted.\nI will now discuss these points quite briefly. I will provide additional detail in the appendix to this testimony.3\nSpillovers Produce the TBTF Problem\nUninsured creditors of systemically important firms come to expect protection because they understand the motivation of policymakers. Policymakers provide protection, in my experience, believing that such protection will contain costly financial spillovers. Policymakers understand that protecting creditors reduces market discipline, but they judge the costs of such a reduction to be smaller than the fallout from the collapse of a major institution. Policymakers worry about spillovers—for example, the failure of other large financial firms due to their direct exposure to a weak firm or because of a more general panic—and the potential impact they may have on the rest of the economy.\nI see three general approaches to addressing concerns over spillovers and thus increasing market discipline (and reducing moral hazard). First, enact reforms that make policymakers more confident that they can impose losses on creditors without creating spillovers that would justify government protection. Second, reduce the losses that failing firms can impose on other firms or markets, which helps reduce spillovers. Third, alter payments systems to reduce their transmission of losses suffered by one firm to others.\nPolicymakers cannot eliminate spillovers entirely, nor can they credibly commit to never providing protection to creditors of systemically important firms. But they can make significant progress in reducing the probability of providing protection, reducing the number of creditors who might receive protection, and reducing the amount of coverage that creditors receive. These are all valuable results. I will now provide several specific examples of approaches to deal with spillovers.\nExamples of Reforms That Credibly Address TBTF by Taking on Spillovers\nTo take on spillovers, I recommend starting with SFS, a combination of reforms that would identify and better manage spillovers, reduce losses from the failure of systemically important financial institutions, and alter uninsured creditor expectations so that they better price risk-taking. To provide a sense for additional reforms I have endorsed, I will provide two other examples of reforms you might consider beyond SFS. Others have begun endorsing reforms of this type, which indicates that attacking spillovers is not considered impossible.\nSystemic Focused Supervision. This approach to addressing spillovers has three components.\nEngage in Early Identification. I would focus financial institution oversight, defined broadly, on identifying potential spillovers both in general and for specific firms, and offering recommendations to mitigate them. To my mind, this is conceptually similar to the macroprudential or systemic-risk supervision others have supported. I would concentrate such efforts, which would require significant input from bank supervisors and others, on carefully mapping out the exposures that systemically important firms have with each other and other basic sources of spillovers. Once the responsible supervisory entity documents where and how spillovers might arise, it would take the lead in offering recommendations to address them. This effort either would assure policymakers that a perceived spillover did not in fact pose a significant threat or would direct resources to fix the vulnerability and generate such comfort.\nLest such an exercise sound like it would be unproductive, I believe that fairly simple failure simulation exercises over the years confirmed the potential spillovers, created by the overseas and derivative operations of some large financial firms, that now bedevil us. I would also note that macroprudential supervision can and should put some of the burden of early identification on the systemically important firms themselves by, for example, requiring them to prepare for and explain the challenges of entering what would amount to a prepackaged bankruptcy.4\nEnhanced Prompt Corrective Action (PCA). To focus supervisors on closing weak institutions early, which reduces the losses they can impose on others, I recommend incorporating market signals of firm risk into the current PCA regime. The incorporation would require care. Market signals contain noise, but such signals also offer forward-looking measures of firm specific-risk with valuable information for bank and other supervisors.\nImprove Communication. The goals here are to establish the credibility of efforts to put creditors at risk of loss and to give creditors the opportunity to alter their behavior. As a result, I recommend that supervisory and other stability-focused agencies clearly communicate the steps in process to avoid full protection. Simply put, creditors cannot read minds and will not alter their expectations and behavior unless they understand the policy changes under way.\nSFS is not the only approach to addressing spillovers. Let me highlight two other reforms by way of example.\nDevelop Capital Instruments to Absorb Losses When Problems Arise. Requiring firms to hold substantially more capital offers a path to absorb losses before they spill over and directly affect other firms. But having to raise expensive capital can either encourage firms to avoid socially beneficial lending or to take on more risk to generate targeted returns. I urge policymakers to examine capital tools that effectively create capital when firms need it most, which reduces their cost and avoids fueling downcycles.5\nPrice for Spillover Creation. A direct way to discourage the types of activities that generate spillovers is to put a price on them because, after all, spillovers impose costs on all of us. Using the early-identification approach noted above to identify the major causes of spillovers would offer a first step. The actual pricing of such activities could occur via something like an insurance premium. The FDIC already has made important progress in creating such an approach for large banks, although the price it charges is capped at a low level at this time.\nI now turn to reforms to address TBTF where I am concerned policymakers may be asking too much.\nDo Not Rely Too Heavily on Traditional Supervision and Regulation (S&R), Resolution Regimes, or Downsizing\nBased on direct observation, I am not convinced that supervisors can consistently and effectively prevent excessive risk-taking by the large firms they oversee in a timely fashion, absent draconian measures that tend to throw out the good with the bad. For this reason, I am not confident that traditional S&R can reduce risk sufficiently such that it addresses the problems associated with TBTF status.6   While policymakers should improve S&R by incorporating the lessons learned over the last two years, it cannot be the bulwark in addressing TBTF.\nI do see clear benefits in increasing the scope of bank-like resolution systems to entities such as bank holding companies. Such regimes would facilitate imposition of losses on equity holders, allow for the abrogation of certain contracts, and provide a framework for operating an insolvent firm. These steps address some spillovers and increase market discipline. But I have long argued that the resolution regime created by FDICIA would not, by itself, effectively limit after-the-fact protection for creditors of systemically important banks.7  Events over the last two years have largely reinforced those concerns. A bank-like resolution regime for nonbanks, which creates a systemic-risk exception, leaves some potential spillovers remaining, and so it is a necessary but not sufficient reform to address TBTF.\nFinally, there has been increased discussion of efforts to address TBTF by making the largest financial firms smaller. My concerns here are practical and do not reflect any particular empathy for managers or equity holders of large firms. In short, I think efforts to break up the firms would result in a focus on a very small number of institutions, thereby leaving many systemically important firms as is. Moreover, I am skeptical, for the reasons noted above, that policymakers will effectively prevent the newly constituted (smaller) firms from taking on risks that can bring down others.\nConclusion\nMaintaining the status quo with regard to TBTF could well impose large costs on the U.S. economy. We cannot afford such costs. I encourage you to focus on proposals that address the underlying reason for protection of creditors of TBTF financial institutions, which is concern for financial spillovers. I have offered examples of such reforms. Absent these or similar reforms, I am skeptical that we will make significant progress against TBTF.\n1 We discuss other potential motivations that could lead to TBTF support and why we think spillovers are the most important motivation in Gary H. Stern and Ron J. Feldman, 2009, Too Big To Fail: The Hazards of Bank Bailouts, chapter 5.\n2 More generally, see the testimony of Daniel K. Tarullo on March 19, 2009, before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs for options for modernizing bank supervision and regulation, including many that seek to foster financial stability.\n3 The appendix includes summaries of the key arguments in our book on TBTF, more recent analysis applying the recommendations in the book to the current crisis, and an initial analysis of proposals to address TBTF by making large financial institutions smaller. See our writings on TBTF.\n4 Raghuram Rajan made a similar recommendation in “The Credit Crisis and Cycle Proof Regulation,” the Homer Jones Lecture at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, April 15, 2009.\n5 We discuss such a recommendation, based on work by Mark Flannery, briefly on page 128 of the TBTF book.\nFor a more current discussion of this idea, along with other proposals to address TBTF, see the analysis carried out by the Squam Lake Working Group on Financial Regulation.\n6 For a fuller discussion, see Appendix C of the TBTF book.\n7 For a fuller discussion of limitations of the FDICIA resolution process, see Appendix A of the TBTF book.\n\nChairman Dodd, Ranking Member Shelby, and members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to review the too big to fail (TBTF) problem with you today. I will develop a simple conclusion in this testimony: The key to addressing TBTF is to reduce substantially the negative spillover effects stemming from the failure of a systemically important financial institution. Let me explain how I have come to that conclusion.\n\nThe TBTF problem is one of undesirable incentives which we need to address if we hope to fix the problem. TBTF arises, by definition, when the uninsured creditors of systemically important financial institutions expect government protection from loss when these financial institutions get into financial or operational trouble. The key to addressing this problem and changing incentives, therefore, is to convince these creditors that they are at risk of loss. If creditors continue to expect special protection, the moral hazard of government protection will continue. That is, the creditors will continue to underprice the risk-taking of these financial institutions, overfund them, and fail to provide effective market discipline Facing prices that are too low, systemically important firms will take on too much risk. Excessive risk-taking squanders valuable economic resources and, in the extreme, leads to financial crises that impose substantial losses on taxpayers. Put another way, if policymakers do not address TBTF, the United States likely will endure an inefficient financial system, slower economic growth, and lower living standards than otherwise would be the case.\n\nTo address TBTF, policymakers must change these incentives, and I recommend the following steps to achieve that goal. And let me emphasize that these are my personal views.\n\nFirst, identify why policymakers provide protection to uninsured creditors. If we do not address the underlying rationale for providing protection, we will not credibly put creditors of systemically important firms at risk of loss. The threat of financial spillovers leads policymakers to provide such protection.1 Indeed, I would define systemically important financial institutions by the potential that their financial and operational weaknesses can spill over to other financial institutions, capital markets, and the rest of the economy. As a result, my recommendations to address the TBTF problem focus on mitigating the perceived and real fallout from financial spillovers.\n\nSecond, enact reforms to reduce the perceived or real threat of the spillovers that motivate after-the fact protection of uninsured creditors. These reforms include, but are not limited to, increased supervisory focus on preparation for the potential failure of a large financial institution, enhanced prompt corrective action, and better communication of efforts to put creditors of systemically important firms at risk of loss. I call this combination of reforms systemic focused supervision (SFS). Other reforms outside of SFS will help address TBTF as well. I also recommend, for example, capital regimes that automatically provide increased protection against loss during bad times and insurance premiums that raise the cost for financial institution activities that create spillovers. I recognize the substantial benefits of highlighting a single reform that would fix TBTF, but I believe a variety of steps are required to credibly take on TBTF.2\n\nThird, be careful about relying heavily on reforms that do not materially reduce spillovers. In particular, I do not think that intensification of traditional supervision and regulation of large financial firms will effectively address the TBTF problem. In a similar vein, while I support the creation of a new resolution regime for systemically important nonbank financial institutions, I would augment the new resolution regime with the types of reforms I just noted.\n\nI will now discuss these points quite briefly. I will provide additional detail in the appendix to this testimony.3\n\nUninsured creditors of systemically important firms come to expect protection because they understand the motivation of policymakers. Policymakers provide protection, in my experience, believing that such protection will contain costly financial spillovers. Policymakers understand that protecting creditors reduces market discipline, but they judge the costs of such a reduction to be smaller than the fallout from the collapse of a major institution. Policymakers worry about spillovers—for example, the failure of other large financial firms due to their direct exposure to a weak firm or because of a more general panic—and the potential impact they may have on the rest of the economy.\n\nI see three general approaches to addressing concerns over spillovers and thus increasing market discipline (and reducing moral hazard). First, enact reforms that make policymakers more confident that they can impose losses on creditors without creating spillovers that would justify government protection. Second, reduce the losses that failing firms can impose on other firms or markets, which helps reduce spillovers. Third, alter payments systems to reduce their transmission of losses suffered by one firm to others.\n\nPolicymakers cannot eliminate spillovers entirely, nor can they credibly commit to never providing protection to creditors of systemically important firms. But they can make significant progress in reducing the probability of providing protection, reducing the number of creditors who might receive protection, and reducing the amount of coverage that creditors receive. These are all valuable results.

To provide a sense for additional reforms I have endorsed, I will provide two other examples of reforms you might consider beyond SFS.

            "content": "Introduction\nFor the basis of my remarks today, I thought I would discuss the state of the economy, the economic outlook, and actions taken to restore financial stability. Obviously, that is a lot of ground to cover, and I recognize that in reviewing a wide range of material I will necessarily gloss over some highly relevant nuances. Perhaps we can cover those during the question-and-answer session. And in any event, I must remind you that, as always, I am speaking only for myself and not for others in the Federal Reserve.\nAs to organization of these comments, I will start with the financial crisis, the importance of reestablishing stability and well-functioning financial institutions and markets, and actions that should be taken to avoid these problems in the future. The state of the financial world is essential to understanding current economic conditions and prospects for the economy, and these subjects will form the latter half of these remarks.\nFinancial Conditions\nAt the risk of belaboring the obvious, it is both undeniable and an understatement to observe that these are challenging times—indeed, historic times—for participants in financial markets and for policymakers as well. Beginning about 21 months ago, financial markets were rocked by a series of shocks which ultimately had global implications and whose repercussions remain severe to this day. While conditions in credit markets have improved over the past several months, in general appreciable strains persist. The improvement appears to be due, in part, to the aggressive policy response of the Federal Reserve as well as programs introduced by the Treasury and FDIC.\nThe Federal Reserve, in particular, has reduced short-term interest rates significantly, worked to improve liquidity both in important markets and for a range of financial institutions, and purchased longer-term debt instruments in volume in order to decrease those rates as well. While it is still too early to fully tally results, there has been progress, and I anticipate more to come as select programs become fully operational, participation increases, and confidence improves.\nThe Role of the Financial System\nA healthy, smoothly functioning financial system is essential to sustained economic growth, for businesses and households alike require the ability to finance projects at competitive terms and conditions, be they investment in plant and equipment or purchases of homes and durable goods. Right now, the financial system is impaired, and there is considerable rhetoric about a so-called credit crunch. To be sure, some borrowers are encountering substantial difficulty in obtaining funding, but conversations with numerous bankers and their customers reveal a diverse set of circumstances, ranging from “business as usual” on the one hand to appreciable credit restriction on the other. One size clearly does not fit all.\nBesides its role in investment, there are other compelling reasons why restoration of sound financial institutions and markets is of the highest priority. Markets that are closed obviously fail to price the financial instruments that normally trade on them, and such pricing is critical to resource allocation and reallocation. In particular, the reallocation of resources that should occur in a recession and that is fundamental to economic recovery is inhibited when financial markets are not functioning or are functioning poorly. Unless conditions improve, such market failures threaten to prolong the recession.\nFurther, the commercial banking system has long been thought of, and indeed has served as, a principal backup source of liquidity for many other financial institutions and markets. Banks continue to play this role but, for a variety of reasons, it has become more challenging to do so. For one thing, the so-called shadow banking system grew rapidly relative to the traditional banking sector over the past two decades or so. And now the demands on the banks from these nonbank financial institutions are that much greater, making it difficult for banks to respond adequately to all customers. Restoration of a healthy banking system would help to mitigate this problem.\nToo-Big-to-Fail\nIn view of the severity of the financial disruptions of the past 21 months, it is essential that we begin immediately to give serious thought to avoiding a recurrence of these events and to addressing the too-big-to-fail (TBTF) issue, now widely if belatedly acknowledged as an exceedingly costly problem. While not constituting “proof,” it is striking that most of the losses suffered to date during the financial crisis have been at the largest institutions operating in the country.\nI have in fact spoken and written extensively—some might say obsessively—about TBTF over the past five years. In 2004, I co-authored (with my colleague Ron Feldman) a book on the subject titled Too-Big-to-Fail: The Hazards of Bank Bailouts, just released in paperback by the Brookings Institution. I think it fair to say that Feldman and I, unlike most other policymakers and analysts, recognized in a timely way that TBTF was a severe and growing problem, that it had not been addressed effectively by the FDICIA legislation of 1991, and that it would eventually and inevitably lead to excessive risk-taking, turmoil in financial markets, and disruption in the economy.\nFurther, I think an important question is: How is it that we put high priority on the growing TBTF problem and its ramifications when others did not? The short and direct answer to this question is that we focused on understanding the incentives of uninsured creditors of large, complex financial institutions, the incentives of management of such institutions, and the incentives of policymakers responsible for economic and financial stability. And we understood the implications of such incentives.\nThe bottom line of our analysis is that creditors of such complex financial institutions expected, on the basis of relatively well-established precedents and on an understanding of policymakers' motivations, protection if failure threatened. As a consequence, they had at most modest incentive to be concerned about the condition and prospects of these large institutions, leading to underpricing of risk-taking. With risk underpriced, these institutions took on excessive amounts of it, leading eventually to the precarious position of some of them. And policymakers, fearing massive, negative spillover effects to other institutions, financial markets more generally, and the economy itself, provided protection and validated creditor expectations.\nThis emphasis on incentives is not merely historical background. To the contrary, I am convinced that just as incentives were at the heart of the TBTF problem, they necessarily must be at the heart of the solution. Our proposal to correct TBTF, called “systemic focused supervision” (SFS) is designed to better align incentives so as to significantly reduce both the TBTF problem and the probability of future episodes of major instability. The keys to this are, in fact, reforms which make policymakers confident that they need not intervene if a large institution encounters difficulty and to put creditors on notice that they are likely to experience losses in such circumstances.\nRather than review the specifics of SFS this afternoon—they are described in virtually all of my speeches of the past seven months—let me instead warn that proposals which purport to address TBTF but which fail to correct incentives are unlikely to succeed. In particular, proposals to “shrink” the largest financial institutions or to rely on heightened regulation and supervision of and increased capital for such institutions do not address the fundamental problem and must therefore be viewed as unlikely to effectively curb TBTF.\nThe Economy\nLet me turn now to the state of the economy and its prospects. As you are no doubt well aware, the national economy is in the midst of a serious recession which began about a year and a half ago, a downturn which has affected most industries and virtually every region of the country. The recession, moreover, is global in nature. In this country, employment has declined significantly during the contraction in activity, and the unemployment rate has climbed to 8.5 percent nationwide. This region of the country has not been immune from these problems, as the data as well as reports from our directors and other contacts reveal.\nGiven the breadth of the downturn, it is difficult at this stage to identify with conviction the engine, or engines, of expansion that will propel the recovery of the national economy. In my experience, this is always the case in the midst of recession.\nStill, I continue to think that improvement in business activity is not too far off. Interest rates are low and financial conditions are improving, albeit unevenly. Major fiscal policy stimulus is now under way and should add to aggregate demand in a timely way unless consumers and businesses turn exceedingly cautious.\nMoreover, adjustments which typically occur in a contraction ultimately help to lay the foundation for renewed growth. For example, as business continues to reduce output and employment, inventories shrink, and at some point aggregate supply falls below even the diminished level of demand, leading to increases in hours worked, net new hiring, and a general pickup in activity. There are, moreover, signs that consumer spending is in the process of stabilizing after its sharp fourth-quarter decline; indeed, consumer spending increased in the first quarter, according to the recently released GDP report. And progress is under way in working off the inventory of unsold, unoccupied homes and condos.\nOnce the economic recovery begins, the pace of the expansion is likely to be subdued for a time. There is historical precedent for this, since the recovery of the early 1990s was initially quite modest, as was the recovery earlier this decade. More importantly, in view of the state of the credit markets, it seems a fair bet that it will take time for momentum to build. But with the passage of time—as we get into the middle of 2010 and beyond—I would expect to see a resumption of healthy growth.\nIt is also likely to take some time for labor market conditions to improve meaningfully. Again, there is ample precedent for this and, more fundamentally, employment may well continue to fall in industries which are contracting—finance, construction, autos—even as it picks up elsewhere.\nWhat of the outlook for inflation? Concerns today appear to have coalesced around two competing perspectives, namely: (1) concern for future inflation, stemming from the Federal Reserve's provision of huge amounts of liquidity in response to the financial crisis; (2) deflation, resulting presumably from the downturn in global economic activity.\nNeither concern can be readily dismissed but, if economic growth resumes in the United States as I expect, the threat of deflation should diminish commensurately. And, to date, there is scant evidence of deflation in so-called core measures of inflation. As for liquidity provision and inflation, it is important to emphasize that the relation between growth in the money supply and the path of prices holds in the long run, over periods of at least five and more likely 10 years. Thus, there is ample time for the Federal Reserve to withdraw excess liquidity as appropriate.\nResearch conducted by economists at our Bank over the past several decades reveals that, in general, the regional economy fluctuates with the national economy, and this is especially true if the agricultural sector is excluded from the analysis. Taking a step back, this result is unsurprising since in the aggregate the composition of the regional economy is similar to that of the nation as a whole. Thus, I would expect the regional economy to track the path of the national economy in the years ahead.\nConclusion\nLet me reiterate just a few points, in wrapping up these remarks. First, many financial markets remain strained, and credit issues are likely to weigh on the economy for some time. Overall, it is essential to restore the health of financial institutions and markets, so that long-lived projects can be financed, so that resource reallocation is facilitated, and so that liquidity improves. In part as a consequence of the state of the credit markets, the recession is likely to persist for some time longer, and the initial stage of the recovery seems likely to be subdued. Nevertheless, in view of the policies already in place here and abroad, a resumption of growth should not be too far off, especially given the economy's fundamental resilience. Before long, attention will appropriately turn to banking issues and policies, and especially to addressing the vexing issue of TBTF. This effort should be among our highest priorities and should focus on correcting the incentives that contributed to the problem and the instability that followed from it. Proposals aimed at TBTF which fail to align incentives properly are not likely to succeed and should be avoided, else they waste valuable time and resources.\n\nFor the basis of my remarks today, I thought I would discuss the state of the economy, the economic outlook, and actions taken to restore financial stability. Obviously, that is a lot of ground to cover, and I recognize that in reviewing a wide range of material I will necessarily gloss over some highly relevant nuances.

Restoration of a healthy banking system would help to mitigate this problem.\n\nIn view of the severity of the financial disruptions of the past 21 months, it is essential that we begin immediately to give serious thought to avoiding a recurrence of these events and to addressing the too-big-to-fail (TBTF) issue, now widely if belatedly acknowledged as an exceedingly costly problem. While not constituting “proof,” it is striking that most of the losses suffered to date during the financial crisis have been at the largest institutions operating in the country.\n\nI have in fact spoken and written extensively—some might say obsessively—about TBTF over the past five years. In 2004, I co-authored (with my colleague Ron Feldman) a book on the subject titled Too-Big-to-Fail: The Hazards of Bank Bailouts, just released in paperback by the Brookings Institution. I think it fair to say that Feldman and I, unlike most other policymakers and analysts, recognized in a timely way that TBTF was a severe and growing problem, that it had not been addressed effectively by the FDICIA legislation of 1991, and that it would eventually and inevitably lead to excessive risk-taking, turmoil in financial markets, and disruption in the economy.\n\nFurther, I think an important question is: How is it that we put high priority on the growing TBTF problem and its ramifications when others did not? The short and direct answer to this question is that we focused on understanding the incentives of uninsured creditors of large, complex financial institutions, the incentives of management of such institutions, and the incentives of policymakers responsible for economic and financial stability. And we understood the implications of such incentives.\n\nThe bottom line of our analysis is that creditors of such complex financial institutions expected, on the basis of relatively well-established precedents and on an understanding of policymakers' motivations, protection if failure threatened. As a consequence, they had at most modest incentive to be concerned about the condition and prospects of these large institutions, leading to underpricing of risk-taking. With risk underpriced, these institutions took on excessive amounts of it, leading eventually to the precarious position of some of them. And policymakers, fearing massive, negative spillover effects to other institutions, financial markets more generally, and the economy itself, provided protection and validated creditor expectations.\n\nThis emphasis on incentives is not merely historical background. To the contrary, I am convinced that just as incentives were at the heart of the TBTF problem, they necessarily must be at the heart of the solution. Our proposal to correct TBTF, called “systemic focused supervision” (SFS) is designed to better align incentives so as to significantly reduce both the TBTF problem and the probability of future episodes of major instability. The keys to this are, in fact, reforms which make policymakers confident that they need not intervene if a large institution encounters difficulty and to put creditors on notice that they are likely to experience losses in such circumstances.\n\nRather than review the specifics of SFS this afternoon—they are described in virtually all of my speeches of the past seven months—let me instead warn that proposals which purport to address TBTF but which fail to correct incentives are unlikely to succeed. In particular, proposals to “shrink” the largest financial institutions or to rely on heightened regulation and supervision of and increased capital for such institutions do not address the fundamental problem and must therefore be viewed as unlikely to effectively curb TBTF.\n\nLet me turn now to the state of the economy and its prospects. As you are no doubt well aware, the national economy is in the midst of a serious recession which began about a year and a half ago, a downturn which has affected most industries and virtually every region of the country. The recession, moreover, is global in nature. In this country, employment has declined significantly during the contraction in activity, and the unemployment rate has climbed to 8.5 percent nationwide. This region of the country has not been immune from these problems, as the data as well as reports from our directors and other contacts reveal.\n\nGiven the breadth of the downturn, it is difficult at this stage to identify with conviction the engine, or engines, of expansion that will propel the recovery of the national economy. In my experience, this is always the case in the midst of recession.\n\nStill, I continue to think that improvement in business activity is not too far off. Interest rates are low and financial conditions are improving, albeit unevenly. Major fiscal policy stimulus is now under way and should add to aggregate demand in a timely way unless consumers and businesses turn exceedingly cautious.\n\nMoreover, adjustments which typically occur in a contraction ultimately help to lay the foundation for renewed growth. For example, as business continues to reduce output and employment, inventories shrink, and at some point aggregate supply falls below even the diminished level of demand, leading to increases in hours worked, net new hiring, and a general pickup in activity. There are, moreover, signs that consumer spending is in the process of stabilizing after its sharp fourth-quarter decline; indeed, consumer spending increased in the first quarter, according to the recently released GDP report. And progress is under way in working off the inventory of unsold, unoccupied homes and condos.\n\nOnce the economic recovery begins, the pace of the expansion is likely to be subdued for a time. There is historical precedent for this, since the recovery of the early 1990s was initially quite modest, as was the recovery earlier this decade. More importantly, in view of the state of the credit markets, it seems a fair bet that it will take time for momentum to build. But with the passage of time—as we get into the middle of 2010 and beyond—I would expect to see a resumption of healthy growth.\n\nIt is also likely to take some time for labor market conditions to improve meaningfully. Again, there is ample precedent for this and, more fundamentally, employment may well continue to fall in industries which are contracting—finance, construction, autos—even as it picks up elsewhere.\n\nWhat of the outlook for inflation? Concerns today appear to have coalesced around two competing perspectives, namely: (1) concern for future inflation, stemming from the Federal Reserve's provision of huge amounts of liquidity in response to the financial crisis; (2) deflation, resulting presumably from the downturn in global economic activity.\n\nNeither concern can be readily dismissed but, if economic growth resumes in the United States as I expect, the threat of deflation should diminish commensurately. And, to date, there is scant evidence of deflation in so-called core measures of inflation. As for liquidity provision and inflation, it is important to emphasize that the relation between growth in the money supply and the path of prices holds in the long run, over periods of at least five and more likely 10 years. Thus, there is ample time for the Federal Reserve to withdraw excess liquidity as appropriate.\n\nResearch conducted by economists at our Bank over the past several decades reveals that, in general, the regional economy fluctuates with the national economy, and this is especially true if the agricultural sector is excluded from the analysis. Taking a step back, this result is unsurprising since in the aggregate the composition of the regional economy is similar to that of the nation as a whole. Thus, I would expect the regional economy to track the path of the national economy in the years ahead.\n\nLet me reiterate just a few points, in wrapping up these remarks. First, many financial markets remain strained, and credit issues are likely to weigh on the economy for some time. Overall, it is essential to restore the health of financial institutions and markets, so that long-lived projects can be financed, so that resource reallocation is facilitated, and so that liquidity improves. In part as a consequence of the state of the credit markets, the recession is likely to persist for some time longer, and the initial stage of the recovery seems likely to be subdued. Nevertheless, in view of the policies already in place here and abroad, a resumption of growth should not be too far off, especially given the economy's fundamental resilience. Before long, attention will appropriately turn to banking issues and policies, and especially to addressing the vexing issue of TBTF. This effort should be among our highest priorities and should focus on correcting the incentives that contributed to the problem and the instability that followed from it. Proposals aimed at TBTF which fail to align incentives properly are not likely to succeed and should be avoided, else they waste valuable time and resources."

            "content": "Introduction\nWhen I agreed to speak at this economic summit, it was suggested that I discuss, among other things, the state of the economy, the outlook, and actions the Federal Reserve has taken to restore financial stability. That obviously is a lot of ground to cover, but I am willing to give it a shot, recognizing that in reviewing a wide range of material I will necessarily gloss over some highly relevant nuances. Perhaps we can cover those during the question-and-answer session. And in any event, I must remind you that, as always, I am speaking only for myself and not for others in the Federal Reserve.\nAs to organization of these comments, I will start with the financial crisis, the importance of reestablishing stability and well-functioning financial institutions and markets, and actions that should be taken to avoid these problems in the future. The state of the financial world is essential to understanding current economic conditions and prospects for the economy, both nationally and in South Dakota, and these subjects will form the latter half of these remarks.\nFinancial Conditions\nAt the risk of belaboring the obvious, it is both undeniable and an understatement to observe that these are challenging times for participants in financial markets and for policymakers as well. Beginning about 20 months ago, financial markets were rocked by a series of shocks which ultimately had global implications and whose repercussions remain severe to this day. While conditions in credit markets have improved over the past several months, in general appreciable strains persist. The improvement appears to be due, in part, to the aggressive policy response of the Federal Reserve as well as programs introduced by the Treasury and FDIC.\nThe Federal Reserve, in particular, has reduced short-term interest rates significantly, worked to improve liquidity in important markets, and purchased longer-term debt instruments in volume in order to decrease those rates as well. While it is still far too early to fully tally results, there has been progress, and I anticipate more to come as select programs become fully operational and participation increases.\nThe Role of the Financial System\nA healthy, smoothly functioning financial system is essential to sustained economic growth, for businesses and households alike require the ability to finance projects at competitive terms and conditions, be they investment in plant and equipment or purchases of homes and durable goods. Right now, the financial system is impaired, and there is much concern about a so-called credit crunch. To be sure, some borrowers are encountering substantial difficulty in obtaining funding, but conversations with numerous bankers and their customers reveal a diverse set of circumstances, ranging from “business as usual” on the one hand to appreciable credit restriction on the other. One size clearly does not fit all.\nBesides its role in investment, there are other compelling reasons why restoration of sound financial institutions and markets is of the highest priority. Markets that are closed obviously fail to price the financial instruments that normally trade on them, and such pricing is critical to resource allocation and reallocation. In particular, the reallocation of resources that should occur in a recession and that is fundamental to economic recovery is inhibited when financial markets are not functioning or are functioning poorly. Unless conditions improve, such market failures threaten to prolong the recession.\nFurther, the commercial banking system has long been thought of, and indeed has served as, a principal backup source of liquidity for many other financial institutions and markets. Banks continue to play this role but, for a variety of reasons, it has become more challenging to do so. For one thing, the so-called shadow banking system grew rapidly relative to the traditional banking sector over the past two decades or so. And now the demands on the banks from these nonbank financial institutions are that much greater, making it difficult for banks to respond adequately to all customers. Restoration of a healthy banking system would help to mitigate this problem.\nToo-Big-to-Fail\nIn view of the severity of the financial disruptions of the past 20 months, it is essential that we begin immediately to give serious thought to avoiding a recurrence of these events and to addressing the too-big-to-fail (TBTF) issue, now widely if belatedly acknowledged as an exceedingly costly problem. While not constituting “proof,” it is striking that most of the losses suffered to date during the financial crisis have been at the largest institutions operating in the country.\nI have in fact spoken and written extensively—some might say obsessively—about TBTF over the past five years; indeed, in 2004, I co-authored (with my colleague Ron Feldman) a book on the subject titled Too-Big-to-Fail: The Hazards of Bank Bailouts, just rereleased in paperback by the Brookings Institution. Feldman and I, unlike most other policymakers and analysts, recognized in a timely way that TBTF was a severe and growing problem, that it had not been addressed effectively by the FDICIA legislation of 1991, and that it would eventually and inevitably lead to excessive risk-taking, turmoil in financial markets, and disruption in the economy.\nHow is it that we identified the consequences of TBTF so accurately? The short and direct answer to this question is that we took the time and trouble to understand the incentives of uninsured creditors of large, complex financial institutions, of the management of such institutions, and of policymakers responsible for economic and financial stability. And we understood the implications of such incentives.\nThe bottom line of our analysis is that creditors of large, complex financial institutions expected protection if failure threatened. As a consequence, they had little incentive to be concerned about the condition and prospects of such institutions, leading to underpricing of risk-taking.

In particular, proposals to “shrink” the largest financial institutions or to rely on heightened regulation and supervision of and increased capital for such institutions do not address the fundamental problem and must therefore be viewed as unlikely to effectively curb TBTF.\nThe Economy\nLet me turn now to the state of the economy and its prospects, both nationally and regionally. As you are no doubt well aware, the national economy is in the midst of a serious recession which began over a year ago, a downturn which has affected most industries and virtually every region of the country. Employment has declined significantly during the contraction in activity, and the unemployment rate has climbed to 8.5 percent nationwide. South Dakota and the Sioux Falls area have not been immune from these problems—as reports from our directors and other contacts reveal—although the decline locally has been comparatively mild.\nGiven the breadth of the downturn, it is difficult at this stage to identify with conviction the engine, or engines, of expansion that will propel the recovery of the national economy. In my experience, this is always the case.\nStill, I continue to think that improvement in business activity is not too far off.

South Dakota is no exception to this generalization, although at times over the past several decades the ongoing success of Sioux Falls may have partially masked this relation. But in my judgment, the regional economy is likely to track the path of the national economy in the years ahead.\nConclusion\nLet me reiterate just a few points, in wrapping up these remarks.

If this situation goes uncorrected, the result will almost surely be inefficient marshaling and allocation of financial resources, serious episodes of financial instability, and lower standards of living than otherwise. Certainly, we should seek to improve and strengthen supervision and regulation where we can, but supervision and regulation is not a"

Beginning about 20 months ago, financial markets were rocked by a series of shocks, which ultimately had global implications and whose repercussions remain severe to this day. Policymakers, here and abroad, many of whom have deep confidence in the self-equilibrating nature of a market economy, have responded aggressively and, in some instances, with unprecedented action. It is still too early to tally results, and it is also unclear if further steps will be required to restore stability. However, I am guardedly optimistic that many pieces are now in place to contribute to improvement in financial market conditions and in business activity.\nThe heart of my remarks this afternoon will be a discussion of economic policies suitable to the challenges that continue to confront the economy and financial system. But before getting into the policies themselves, it is necessary to devote some time to a description of both current conditions and near-term prospects, so that we start from the same base. And I will remind you that, as always, I am speaking only for myself and not for others in the Federal Reserve.\nCurrent Conditions and the Outlook\nI will initially turn to the state of the economy and the credit markets and prospects for the next two to three years. Conditions in credit markets have improved over the past several months, although in general appreciable strains persist. On the positive side, term funding is more readily available than at the height of the crisis, and risk premia have diminished in parts of the corporate market. On the other hand, markets for many securitized products remain closed, and significant doubts persist about asset values and the solvency of some large institutions. Much has been made recently about banks' unwillingness to lend to creditworthy borrowers and a so-called credit crunch; in my view, there is likely more here than meets the eye.\nThere is little doubt that many creditworthy customers are today being financed by their banks as they normally have been. There is also little question that some borrowers with satisfactory or better credit histories are finding it more expensive, if not impossible, to obtain financing. There are at least a couple of factors at work, abstracting from any fundamental deterioration in the condition of the borrower. Commercial banks have long been thought of, and indeed have functioned as, the backup source of liquidity for many other financial institutions and markets. Banks continue to play this role, but it has become more challenging to do so because some lenders find themselves capital-constrained as a result of recent losses and/or sizable, unanticipated additions to their balance sheets of formerly off-balance-sheet instruments. Equally important, the so-called shadow-banking system grew rapidly relative to the traditional banking sector over the past two decades or so. And now the demands on the banks from these nonbank financial institutions are that much greater, making it difficult for banks to respond adequately to all customers.\nOverall, it seems to me that these credit strains are significant and pervasive, and that these conditions are likely to weigh on economic activity for some time. Moreover, since banks are traditionally a major source of financing in times of stress, it is important to restore the health of the industry so that it can fulfill this role. As it is, the economy is in the midst of a serious recession that seems likely to persist at least through mid-year. Most sectors of the economy are contracting, and it is difficult, as it always is, to identify with confidence the engine, or engines, of expansion that will propel the recovery in activity.\nStill, there is reason to think that improvement is not too far off. Interest rates are low and financial conditions are improving, albeit unevenly. Major fiscal policy stimulus is now under way and should add to aggregate demand in a timely way unless consumers and businesses turn exceedingly cautious. Moreover, adjustments which typically occur in a contraction ultimately help to lay the foundation for renewed growth. For example, as business continues to reduce output and employment, inventories shrink and at some point aggregate supply falls below even the diminished level of demand, leading to increases in hours worked, net new hiring, and a general pickup in activity.\nOnce under way, the pace of the expansion is likely to be subdued for a time. There is historical precedent for this, since the recovery of the early 1990s was initially quite modest, as was the recovery earlier this decade. More importantly, in view of the state of the credit markets, it seems a fair bet that it will take time for momentum to build. But with the passage of time—as we get into the middle of 2010 and beyond—I would expect to see a resumption of healthy growth.\nWhat of the outlook for inflation? Not all that long ago, there was considerable concern about prospects for inflation, fueled in large measure by the run-up in energy and other commodity prices. These concerns have subsided with the dramatic fall in the price of energy, replaced, as it were, by two competing issues, namely: (1) concern for future inflation, stemming from the Federal Reserve's provision of huge amounts of liquidity in response to the financial crisis; (2) deflation, resulting presumably from the downturn in global economic activity.\nNeither concern can be dismissed out of hand but, if economic growth resumes in the U.S. as I expect, the threat of deflation should diminish commensurately. As for liquidity provision and inflation, it is important to recall that the relation between growth in the money supply and the path of prices holds in the long run, over periods of at least five and more likely 10 years. Thus, there is ample time to withdraw excess liquidity as appropriate.\nMacroeconomic Policies\nI previously noted that a sizable fiscal stimulus package is in place and seems likely to provide impetus to aggregate demand. As far as monetary policy is concerned, the Federal Reserve has already reduced short-term interest rates to historically low levels and has established a variety of programs to directly provide liquidity, in volume, to an enhanced range of institutions and markets. We have indicated our willingness to use these, and other nontraditional policy tools such as purchases of mortgage-backed securities and the TALF, to help support credit markets and economic activity. This is an aggressive policy of “credit easing;” indeed, the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, which as recently as mid-September 2008 (about six months ago) stood at about $1 trillion, is now in the range of $2 trillion. The U.S. Treasury and FDIC have also stepped in to initiate or increase guarantees of financial firms' liabilities, and the Treasury has provided capital to banks as well. Many policymakers abroad have engaged in similarly extraordinary actions.\nAll of this leads to the conclusion that macroeconomic policies are directed forcefully to reestablishing conditions for sustainable economic growth. It may take time, but I expect these policies, together with the underlying flexibility and resilience of the economy, to succeed.\nFinancial Policies\nThere should be little doubt that, in the wake of the financial crisis we have experienced, there will be considerable focus on remediation of policies governing the financial services industry in the months ahead. This emphasis is fully appropriate, and it is critical that we get what I will for convenience call â€œbanking policiesâ€? right. On this occasion, I would like to explicitly comment on several aspects of such policies.\nIt seems likely that, going forward, there will be increased emphasis on tight regulation of financial institutions and their activities, especially of large, complex, “too-big or too-interconnected-to-fail” institutions. Clearly, there will be a role for conventional supervision and regulation in the future. Observers have rightly noted that the financial sector suffers from various market failures around issues of information and misaligned incentives, and conventional supervision and regulation can help address those concerns. At the same time, we have to be careful to avoid two potentially serious pitfalls: (1) excessive reliance on conventional supervision and regulation, essentially asking more than can be delivered; and (2) excessive regulation, resulting in an inefficient financial sector with negative consequences for economic performance.\nThis latter point is, I think, relatively easy to see. If the rules, although well intentioned, are too onerous, the resulting financial system may be very safe, but simultaneously it may be unnecessarily costly for households and businesses to obtain funding for worthwhile projects. This is not a desirable outcome. To drive this point home, let me quote Ken Rogoff, a distinguished economist at Harvard who has considerable public policy experience as well: “But I'm more concerned about what happens to our financial sector at the end of this, what's left of it. I just don't know what's going to emerge after the political system works it over. I hope that we do not throw the baby out with the bathwater. If we rebuild a very statist and inefficient financial sector—as I fear we will—it's hard to imagine that growth won't suffer for years.”\nThe first concern I mentioned, about the risk of excessive reliance on conventional supervision and regulation, is more subtle but no less important. Additional regulations and resources devoted to enforcing them are not likely, by themselves, to effectively address the incentive issues in banking and the potential for serious systemic risk, even if accompanied by increases in standard capital requirements for large institutions. Reasons for this conclusion include the inevitable lag between supervisors' identification of a problem and its ultimate correction, the incentives of management to find ways around regulation, and the time inconsistency problem which frequently makes forbearance look attractive.\nThe recent track record in this area does not inspire confidence: We have, right now, higher expectations and more intensive supervision for the largest banking firms, and the outcomes speak, loudly and clearly, for themselves. Similarly, in the current episode, supervisors have been unable once again to prevent excessive lending to commercial real estate ventures, a well-known, high-risk, high-return business which contributed importantly to the banking problems of the late 1980s and early 1990s.\nTo reiterate, conventional supervision and regulation, even if heightened, is unlikely to be adequate; to be sure, long shots occasionally come in, but it is tournament time and we know that a 15 seed rarely beats a number two. So what should we do? The response to this question brings us to another type of banking policy and also brings us to the substance of a book I co-authored (with Ron Feldman) in 2004, titled Too Big To Fail: The Hazards of Bank Bailouts.\nThe book is about 200 pages in length, and you will be relieved to learn that I do not intend to cover it in detail this afternoon. But the book makes several points critical to future banking policies that are worthy of emphasis and of adoption. Equally importantly, I think that if policymakers had focused on our recommendations, we would at a minimum have been better prepared to address the problems that have arisen over the last 20 months.\nIn short, we were right about several critical issues. To provide just one example of this, let me quote a few sentences from the book: “Capital market participants may simply pull their funding from banks whose condition is not transparent or where they perceive a material chance of failure. … Concern about capital market participants cutting off banks is particularly acute because a greater percentage of funding for the largest banks is short term. The share of the very largest banks' liabilities that are overnight borrowings, for example, has nearly doubled over the last 15 years. Quantity restrictions in short-term capital markets could generate a high degree of instability because banks rely on frequent and rapid replacement of such funding as it matures. For some institutions, no clear alternative exists to capital markets. … Also troubling is that much of the short-term funding provided to banks comes from other banks in the so-called interbank lending market. The increased reliance on short-term interbank lending has also been linked to the increased interdependence of large banks.”\nAs its title suggests, the book argues that too-big-to-fail (or too-interconnected-to-fail) protection of uninsured creditors of systemically important financial institutions distorts incentives and leads to underpricing of risk and therefore excessive risk-taking, and this risk-taking in turn sets the stage for turmoil in financial markets and disruption in the economy. With the expansion of the safety net and increased protection provided during the current crisis, the TBTF problem has, without question, increased substantially, albeit for good reason.\nBut this development makes it all the more critical that future banking policies address TBTF. And the principal reason TBTF exists, that policymakers intervene to protect uninsured creditors of large institutions, is because of deep concern about the fallout, or spillovers, for other firms, financial markets, and the real economy when such an organization gets into difficulty. The key to addressing TBTF, then, is to reduce the potential size and scope of the spillovers, so that policymakers can be confident that intervention is unnecessary, which is to say that the institution is in fact not TBTF.\nWe have written and spoken extensively about our most recent proposal—called systemic focused supervision (SFS)—to accomplish this, so let me cover just the main points today. In general, SFS, unlike conventional bank supervision and regulation, focuses on reduction of spillovers, the key to addressing TBTF. It consists of three pillars: early identification, enhanced prompt corrective action (PCA), and stability-related communication.\nEarly identification. This is a process to identify and to respond, where appropriate, to the material exposures among large financial institutions and between these institutions and capital markets. This process is closely related to the scenario planning recommendation discussed at length in the book. The goals of the exercise are (1) to give policymakers a sense of which events are not likely to severely impair a large financial institution, thus permitting policymakers to avoid providing support, and (2) to identify those exposures that might bring down the firm, and thus are deserving of closer policy scrutiny and, most importantly, an effective and timely response.\nEnhanced prompt corrective action. PCA works by requiring supervisors to take specified actions against a bank as its capital falls below specific triggers. One of its principal virtues is that it relies upon rules rather than supervisory discretion. Closing banks while they still have positive capital, or at most a small loss, can reduce spillovers in a fairly direct way. If a bank's failure does not impose large losses, by definition it cannot directly threaten the viability of other depository institutions that have exposure to it. Thus, the PCA regime offers an important tool to limit systemic risk. However, this regime currently uses triggers that do not adequately account for future losses and give too much discretion to bank management. We would augment the triggers with more forward-looking data, outside the control of bank management, to address these concerns.\nCommunication. The first two pillars of SFS seek to increase market discipline by reducing the motivation policymakers have for protecting creditors. But creditors will not know about efforts to limit spillovers, and therefore will not change their expectations of support, absent explicit communication by policymakers about these efforts.\nConclusion\nLet me reiterate just a few points, in wrapping up these remarks. First, many financial markets remain strained, and credit issues are likely to weigh on the economy for some time. In part as a consequence, the recession is likely to persist through mid-year and the initial stage of the recovery seems likely to be subdued. Nevertheless, in view of the policies already in place here and abroad, a resumption of growth should not be too far off, especially given the economy's fundamental resilience. Before long, attention will appropriately turn to banking issues and policies. Getting these right is both critical and challenging. I have cautioned about placing an excessive burden on conventional bank supervision and regulation, although clearly such policies have a role to play. More constructively, I suggest prompt emphasis on SFS as a means of addressing TBTF and as a contribution to aggregate financial stability going forward. Destiny did not require society to bear the cost of the current financial crisis. To at least some extent, the outcome reflects decisions, implicit or explicit, to ignore warnings of the growing TBTF problem and a failure to prepare for and address potential spillovers. We should not make this mistake again.\n\nAt the risk of belaboring the obvious, it is both undeniable and an understatement to observe that these are challenging times for participants in financial markets and the economy, and for policymakers as well. Beginning about 20 months ago, financial markets were rocked by a series of shocks, which ultimately had global implications and whose repercussions remain severe to this day.

On the other hand, markets for many securitized products remain closed, and significant doubts persist about asset values and the solvency of some large institutions. Much has been made recently about banks' unwillingness to lend to creditworthy borrowers and a so-called credit crunch; in my view, there is likely more here than meets the eye.\nThere is little doubt that many creditworthy customers are today being financed by their banks as they normally have been. There is also little question that some borrowers with satisfactory or better credit histories are finding it more expensive, if not impossible, to obtain financing. There are at least a couple of factors at work, abstracting from any fundamental deterioration in the condition of the borrower. Commercial banks have long been thought of, and indeed have functioned as, the backup source of liquidity for many other financial institutions and markets. Banks continue to play this role, but it has become more challenging today to do so because some lenders find themselves capital-constrained as a result of recent losses and/or sizable, unanticipated additions to their balance sheets of formerly off-balance-sheet instruments. Perhaps more importantly, the so-called “shadow-banking system” grew rapidly relative to the traditional banking sector over the past two decades or so. And now the demands on the banks from these nonbank financial institutions are that much greater, making it difficult for banks to respond adequately to all customers.\nOverall, it seems to me that these credit strains are real and pervasive, and that these conditions are likely to weigh on economic activity for some time. As it is, the economy is in the midst of a serious recession that seems likely to persist for at least another two quarters. Most sectors of the economy are contracting, and it is difficult, as it always is, to identify with confidence the engine, or engines, of expansion that will propel the recovery in activity.\nStill, there is reason to think that improvement is not too far off. Interest rates are low and financial conditions are improving, albeit unevenly. A major fiscal stimulus package is in the offing, which seems likely to add to aggregate demand in a timely way unless consumers and businesses turn exceedingly cautious. Moreover, adjustments which typically occur in a contraction ultimately help to lay the foundation for renewed growth. For example, as business continues to reduce output and employment, inventories shrink and at some point aggregate supply falls below even the diminished level of demand, leading to increases in hours worked, net new hiring, and a general pickup in activity.\nOnce under way, the pace of the expansion is likely to be subdued for a time. There is historical precedent for this, since the recovery of the early 1990s was initially quite modest, as was the recovery earlier this decade. More importantly, in view of the state of the credit markets and of the housing sector, it seems a fair bet that it will take time for momentum to build. But with the passage of time—as we get into the middle of 2010 and beyond—I would expect to see a resumption of healthy growth.\nWhat of the outlook for inflation? Not too many months ago, there was considerable concern about prospects for inflation, fueled in large measure by the run-up in energy and other commodity prices. These concerns have subsided with the dramatic fall in the price of energy, replaced, as it were, by two competing issues, namely: 1) concern for future inflation, stemming from the Federal Reserve's provision of huge amounts of liquidity in response to the financial crisis; 2) deflation, resulting presumably from the prospect of a downturn in global economic activity.\nNeither concern can be dismissed out of hand but, if economic growth resumes in the U.S. as I expect, the threat of deflation should diminish commensurately. As for liquidity provision and inflation, it is important to recall that the relation between growth in the money supply and the path of prices holds in the long run, over periods of at least five and more likely 10 years. Thus, there is ample time to withdraw excess liquidity as appropriate, and in this regard the Federal Reserve remains firmly committed to long-run price stability.\nMacroeconomic Policies\nI previously noted that a sizable fiscal stimulus package is in prospect and seems likely to provide impetus to aggregate demand. As far as monetary policy is concerned, the Federal Reserve has already reduced short-term interest rates to historically low levels and has established a variety of programs to directly provide liquidity, in volume, to an enhanced range of institutions and markets. We have indicated our willingness to use these, and other nontraditional policy tools such as purchases of mortgage-backed securities, to help support credit markets and economic activity. This is an aggressive policy of “credit easing;” indeed, the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, which as recently as mid-September 2008 (about four months ago) stood at about $1 trillion, is now in the range of $2 trillion. The U.S. Treasury and FDIC have also stepped in to initiate or increase guarantees of financial firms' liabilities, and the Treasury has provided capital to banks as well. Many policymakers abroad have engaged in similarly aggressive actions.\nAll of this leads to the conclusion that macroeconomic policies—both those in place and those under consideration—are directed forcefully to reestablishing conditions for sustainable economic growth. It may take time, but I expect these policies, together with the underlying flexibility and resilience of the economy, to succeed.\nFinancial Policies\nThere should be little doubt that, in the wake of the financial crisis we have experienced, there will be considerable focus on remediation of policies governing the financial services industry in the months ahead. This emphasis is fully appropriate, and it is critical that we get what I will for convenience call “banking policies” right. On this occasion, I would like to explicitly comment on two components of such policies.\nIt seems likely that, going forward, there will be increased emphasis on tight regulation of financial institutions and their activities. Clearly, there will be a meaningful role for traditional supervision and regulation in the future. Observers have rightly noted that the financial sector suffers from various market failures around issues of information and misaligned incentives, and supervision and regulation can help address those concerns. At the same time, we have to be careful to avoid two potentially serious pitfalls: 1) excessive reliance on supervision and regulation, essentially asking more than can be delivered; and 2) excessive regulation, resulting in an inefficient financial sector with negative consequences for economic performance.\nThis latter point is, I think, relatively easy to see. If the rules, although well intentioned, are too onerous, the resulting financial system may be very safe, but simultaneously it may be unnecessarily costly for households and businesses to obtain funding for worthwhile projects. This is not a desirable outcome. To drive this point home, let me quote Ken Rogoff, a distinguished economist at Harvard who has considerable public policy experience as well: “But I'm more concerned about what happens to our financial sector at the end of this, what's left of it. I just don't know what's going to emerge after the political system works it over. I hope that we do not throw the baby out with the bathwater. If we rebuild a very statist and inefficient financial sector—as I fear we will—it's hard to imagine that growth won't suffer for years.”\nThe first concern, about the risk of excessive reliance on supervision and regulation, is more subtle but no less important. Additional regulations and resources devoted to enforcing them are not likely, by themselves, to effectively address the incentive issues in banking and the potential for serious systemic risk. Reasons for this conclusion include the inevitable lag between supervisors' identification of a problem and its ultimate correction, the incentives of management to find ways around regulation, and the time inconsistency problem which frequently makes forbearance look attractive.\nIf supervision and regulation, by itself, is unlikely to be sufficient, what is preferable? The response to this question brings us to the second type of banking policies I alluded to earlier, and also brings us to the substance of a book I co-authored (with Ron Feldman) in 2004, titled “Too Big To Fail: The Hazards of Bank Bailouts.”\nThe book is about 200 pages in length, and you will be relieved to learn that I do not intend to cover it in detail this afternoon. But the book makes several points critical to future banking policies that are worthy of emphasis. Equally importantly, I think that if policymakers had focused on our recommendations, we would have been better prepared to address the problems that have arisen over the last 18 months.\nAs its title suggests, the book argues that too-big-to-fail (or too-interconnected-to-fail) protection of uninsured creditors of systemically important financial institutions distorts incentives, leads to underpricing of risk and therefore excessive risk-taking, and this risk-taking in turn sets the stage for turmoil in financial markets and disruption in the economy. With the expansion of the safety net and increased protection provided during the current crisis, the TBTF problem has, without question, increased substantially, albeit for good reason.\nBut this development makes it all the more critical that future banking policies address TBTF. It is our conviction that the principal reason that policymakers intervene to protect uninsured creditors of large institutions is because of deep concern about the fallout, or spillovers, for other firms, financial markets, and the real economy when such an organization gets into difficulty. The key to addressing TBTF, then, is to reduce the potential size and scope of the spillovers, so that policymakers can be confident that intervention is unnecessary.\nWe have written and spoken extensively about our most recent proposal—called systemic focused supervision (SFS)—to accomplish this, so let me cover just the main points today. In general, SFS attempts to focus supervision and regulation efforts on reduction of spillovers, and it consists of three pillars: early identification, enhanced prompt corrective action (PCA), and stability-related communication.\nEarly identification. This is a process to identify and to respond, where appropriate, to the material exposures among large financial institutions and between these institutions and capital markets. This process is closely related to the scenario planning recommendation discussed at length in the book. The goals of the exercise are (1) to give policymakers a sense of which events are not likely to severely impair a large financial institution, thus permitting policymakers to avoid providing support, and (2) to identify those exposures that might bring down the firm, and thus are deserving of closer policy scrutiny and, most importantly, an effective and timely response.\nEnhanced prompt corrective action. PCA works by requiring supervisors to take specified actions against a bank as its capital falls below specified triggers. Closing banks while they still have positive capital, or at most a small loss, can reduce spillovers in a fairly direct way. If a bank's failure does not impose large losses, by definition it cannot directly threaten the viability of other depository institutions that have exposure to it. Thus, the PCA regime offers an important tool to manage systemic risk. However, this regime currently uses triggers that do not adequately account for future losses and give too much discretion to bank management. We would augment the triggers with more forward-looking data outside the control of bank management to address these concerns.\nCommunication. The first two pillars of SFS seek to increase market discipline by reducing the motivation policymakers have for protecting creditors. But creditors will not know about efforts to limit spillovers, and therefore will not change their expectations of support, absent explicit communication by policymakers about these efforts.\nConclusion\nLet me reiterate just a few points, in wrapping up these remarks. First, many financial markets remain strained, and credit issues are likely to weigh on the economy for some time. In part as a consequence, the recession is likely to persist through mid-year and the initial stage of the recovery seems likely to be subdued. Nevertheless, in view of the policies already in place here and abroad and those slated for enactment soon, a resumption of growth should not be too far off, especially given the economy's fundamental resilience. Before long, attention will appropriately turn to banking issues and policies. Getting these right is both critical and challenging. I have cautioned about placing an excessive burden on traditional bank supervision and regulation, although clearly such policies have a valuable role to play. More constructively, I suggest prompt emphasis on SFS as a means of addressing TBTF and as a contribution to aggregate financial stability going forward.\n\nIt is undeniable, and certainly an understatement, to observe that these are challenging times for participants in financial markets and the economy, and for policymakers as well. Beginning about 18 months ago, financial markets were rocked by a series of shocks which ultimately had global implications and whose repercussions are being felt to this day. Policymakers, here and abroad, many of whom have deep confidence in the self-equilibrating nature of a market economy, have responded aggressively and, in some instances, with unprecedented action. It is not only too early to tally results, but it also remains unclear if further steps will be required to restore stability; however, I am guardedly optimistic that many pieces are now in place to rebuild liquidity and to contribute to improvement in business activity.\n\nThe heart of my remarks this afternoon will be a discussion of economic policies suitable to the challenges that continue to confront the economy and financial system. But before getting into the policies themselves, it is necessary to devote some time to a description of both current conditions and near-term prospects, so that we start from the same base. And I will remind you that, as always, I am speaking only for myself and not for others in the Federal Reserve.\n\nI will initially turn to the state of the economy and the credit markets and prospects for the next two to three years. Conditions in credit markets have improved over the past two months, although in general appreciable strains persist. On the positive side, term funding is more readily available than at the height of the crisis, and risk premia have diminished through much of the financial sector. On the other hand, markets for many securitized products remain closed, and significant doubts persist about asset values and the solvency of some large institutions. Much has been made recently about banks' unwillingness to lend to creditworthy borrowers and a so-called credit crunch; in my view, there is likely more here than meets the eye.\n\nThere is little doubt that many creditworthy customers are today being financed by their banks as they normally have been. There is also little question that some borrowers with satisfactory or better credit histories are finding it more expensive, if not impossible, to obtain financing. There are at least a couple of factors at work, abstracting from any fundamental deterioration in the condition of the borrower. Commercial banks have long been thought of, and indeed have functioned as, the backup source of liquidity for many other financial institutions and markets. Banks continue to play this role, but it has become more challenging today to do so because some lenders find themselves capital-constrained as a result of recent losses and/or sizable, unanticipated additions to their balance sheets of formerly off-balance-sheet instruments.

Equally importantly, I think that if policymakers had focused on our recommendations, we would have been better prepared to address the problems that have arisen over the last 18 months.\nAs its title suggests, the book argues that too-big-to-fail (or too-interconnected-to-fail) protection of uninsured creditors of systemically important financial institutions distorts incentives and leads to underpricing of risk and therefore excessive risk-taking. This risk-taking in turn sets the stage for turmoil in financial markets and disruption in the economy. With the expansion of the safety net and increased protection provided during the current crisis, the TBTF problem has, without question, been exacerbated, albeit for good reason.\nBut this development makes it all the more critical that future banking policies address TBTF. It is our conviction that policymakers intervene to protect uninsured creditors of large institutions because of deep concern about the fallout, or spillovers, for other firms, financial markets, and the real economy when such an organization gets into difficulty. The key to addressing TBTF, then, is to reduce the potential size and scope of the spillovers, so that policymakers can be confident that intervention is unnecessary.\nWe have written and spoken extensively about our most recent proposal— called systemic focused supervision (SFS)—to accomplish this, so let me cover just the main points today. In general, SFS attempts to focus supervision and regulation efforts on reduction of spillovers, and it consists of three pillars: early identification, enhanced prompt corrective action (PCA), and stability-related communication.\nEarly identification. This is a process to identify and to respond, where appropriate, to the material exposures among large financial institutions and between these institutions and capital markets. This process is closely related to the scenario planning recommendation discussed at length in the book. The goals of the exercise are (1) to give policymakers a sense of which events are not likely to severely impair a large financial institution, thus permitting policymakers to avoid providing support, and (2) to identify those exposures that might bring down the firm, and thus are deserving of closer policy scrutiny and, most importantly, an effective and timely response.\nEnhanced prompt corrective action. PCA works by requiring supervisors to take specified actions against a bank as its capital falls below specified triggers. Closing banks while they still have positive capital, or at most a small loss, can reduce spillovers in a fairly direct way. If a bank's failure does not impose large losses, by definition it cannot directly threaten the viability of other depository institutions that have exposure to it. Thus, the PCA regime offers an important tool to manage systemic risk. However, this regime currently uses triggers that do not adequately account for future losses and give too much discretion to bank management. We would augment the triggers with more forward-looking data outside the control of bank management to address these concerns.\nCommunication. The first two pillars of SFS seek to increase market discipline by reducing the motivation policymakers have for protecting creditors. But creditors will not know about efforts to limit spillovers, and therefore will not change their expectations of support, absent explicit communication by policymakers about these efforts.\nConclusion\nLet me reiterate just a few points, in wrapping up these remarks. First, many financial markets remain strained, and credit issues are likely to weigh on the economy for some time. In part as a consequence, the recession is likely to persist through mid-year and the initial stage of the recovery seems likely to be subdued. Nevertheless, in view of the policies already in place here and abroad and those slated for enactment soon, a resumption of growth should not be too far off, especially given the economy's fundamental resilience. Before long, attention will appropriately turn to banking issues and policies. Getting these right is both critical and challenging. I have cautioned about placing an excessive burden on traditional bank supervision and regulation, although clearly such policies have a valuable role to play. More constructively, I suggest prompt emphasis on SFS as a means of addressing TBTF and as a contribution to aggregate financial stability going forward.\n\nIt is undeniable, and certainly an understatement, to observe that these are challenging times for participants in financial markets and the economy, and for policymakers as well. Beginning about 18 months ago, financial markets were rocked by a series of shocks which ultimately had global implications and whose repercussions are being felt to this day. Policymakers, many of whom have deep confidence in the self-equilibrating nature of a market economy, have responded aggressively and, in some instances, with unprecedented action. It is not only too early to tally results, but it also remains unclear if further steps will be required to restore stability; however, I am guardedly optimistic that many pieces are now in place to rebuild liquidity and to contribute to improvement in business activity.\n\nThe heart of my remarks this afternoon will be a discussion of economic policies suitable to the challenges that continue to confront the economy and financial system. But before getting into the policies themselves, it is necessary to devote some time to a description of both current conditions and near-term prospects, so that we start from the same base. We may, of course, disagree about the outlook, the risks, or the recommendations, but we should try to be clear about where the disagreement truly lies. And I will remind you that, as always, I am speaking only for myself and not for others in the Federal Reserve.\n\nI will initially turn to the state of the economy and the credit markets and prospects for the next two to three years. Conditions in credit markets have improved over the past two months, although in general appreciable strains persist. On the positive side, term funding is more readily available than at the height of the crisis, and risk premia have diminished through much of the financial sector. On the other hand, markets for many securitized products remain closed, and significant doubts persist about asset values and the solvency of some large institutions. Much has been made recently about banks' unwillingness to lend to creditworthy borrowers and a so-called credit crunch; in my view, there is likely more here than meets the eye.\n\nThere is little doubt that many creditworthy customers are today being financed by their banks as they normally have been. There is also little question that some borrowers with satisfactory or better credit histories are finding it more expensive, if not impossible, to obtain financing. There are at least a couple of factors at work, abstracting from any fundamental deterioration in the condition of the borrower. Commercial banks have long been thought of, and indeed have functioned as, the backup source of liquidity for many other financial institutions and markets. Banks continue to play this role, but it has become more challenging today to do so because some lenders find themselves capital-constrained as a result of recent losses and/or sizable, unanticipated additions to their balance sheets of formerly off-balance-sheet instruments. Perhaps more importantly, the so-called “shadow banking system” grew rapidly relative to the traditional banking sector over the past two decades or so. And now the demands on the banks from these nonbank financial institutions are that much greater, making it difficult for banks to respond adequately to all customers.\n\nOverall, it seems to me that these credit strains are real and pervasive, and that these conditions are likely to weigh on economic activity for some time. As it is, the economy is in the midst of a serious recession that seems likely to persist for at least another two quarters. Most sectors of the economy are contracting, and it is difficult, as it always is, to identify with confidence the engine, or engines, of expansion that will propel the recovery in activity.\n\nStill, there is reason to think that improvement is not too far off. Interest rates are low and financial conditions are improving, albeit unevenly. A major fiscal stimulus package is in the offing, which seems likely to add to aggregate demand in a timely way unless consumers and businesses turn exceedingly cautious. Moreover, adjustments which typically occur in a contraction ultimately help to lay the foundation for renewed growth. For example, as business continues to reduce output and employment, at some point aggregate supply falls below even the diminished level of demand, leading to increases in hours worked, net new hiring, and a general pickup in activity.\n\nOnce under way, the pace of the expansion is likely to be subdued for a time. There is historical precedent for this, since the recovery of the early 1990s was initially quite modest, as was the recovery earlier this decade. More importantly, in view of the state of the credit markets and of the housing sector, it seems a fair bet that it will take time for momentum to build. But with the passage of time—as we get into the middle of 2010 and beyond—I would expect to see a resumption of healthy growth.\n\nWhat of the outlook for inflation? Not too many months ago, there was considerable concern about prospects for inflation, fueled in large measure by the run-up in energy and other commodity prices. These concerns have subsided with the dramatic fall in the price of energy, replaced, as it were, by two competing issues, namely: (1) concern for future inflation, stemming from the Federal Reserve's provision of huge amounts of liquidity in response to the financial crises; (2) deflation, resulting presumably from the prospect of a downturn in global economic activity.\n\nNeither concern can be dismissed out of hand but, if economic growth resumes in the United States as I expect, the threat of deflation should diminish commensurately. As for liquidity provision and inflation, it is important to recall that the relation between growth in the money supply and the path of prices holds in the long run, over periods of at least five and more likely 10 years. Thus, there is ample time to withdraw excess liquidity as appropriate, and in this regard the Federal Reserve remains firmly committed to long-run price stability.\n\nI previously noted that a sizable fiscal stimulus package is in prospect and seems likely to provide impetus to aggregate demand. As far as monetary policy is concerned, the Federal Reserve has already reduced short-term interest rates to historically low levels and has established a variety of programs to directly provide liquidity, in volume, to an enhanced range of institutions and markets. We have indicated our willingness to use these, and other nontraditional policy tools such as purchases of mortgage-backed securities, to help support credit markets and economic activity. Indeed, the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, which as recently as mid-September 2008 (about four months ago) stood at about $1 trillion, is now close to $2.2 trillion. The U.S. Treasury and FDIC have also stepped in to initiate or increase guarantees of financial firms' liabilities, and the Treasury has provided capital to banks as well. Many policymakers abroad have engaged in similarly aggressive actions.\n\nAll of this leads to the conclusion that macroeconomic policies—both those in place and those under consideration—are directed forcefully to reestablishing conditions for sustainable economic growth. It may take time, but I expect these policies, together with the underlying flexibility and resilience of the economy, to succeed.\n\nThere should be little doubt that, in the wake of the financial crisis we have experienced, there will be considerable focus on remediation of policies governing the financial services industry in the months ahead. This emphasis is fully appropriate, and it is critical that we get what I will for convenience call “banking policies” right. On this occasion, I would like to explicitly comment on two components of such policies.\n\nIt seems likely that, going forward, there will be increased emphasis on tight regulation of financial institutions and their activities. Clearly, there will be a meaningful role for traditional supervision and regulation in the future. Observers have rightly noted that the financial sector suffers from various market failures around issues of information and misaligned incentives, and supervision and regulation can help address those concerns. At the same time, we have to be careful to avoid two potentially serious pitfalls: (1) excessive reliance on supervision and regulation, essentially asking more than can be delivered; (2) excessive regulation, resulting in an inefficient financial sector with negative consequences for economic performance.\n\nThis latter point is, I think, relatively easy to see. If the rules, although well intentioned, are too onerous, the resulting financial system may be very safe, but simultaneously it may be unnecessarily costly for households and businesses to obtain funding for worthwhile projects. This is not a desirable outcome. To drive this point home, let me quote Ken Rogoff, a distinguished economist at Harvard who has considerable public policy experience as well: “If we rebuild a very statist and inefficient financial sector—as I fear we will—it's hard to imagine that growth won't suffer for years.”\n\nThe first concern, about the risk of excessive reliance on supervision and regulation, is more subtle but no less important. Additional regulations and resources devoted to enforcing them are not likely, by themselves, to effectively address the incentive issues in banking and the potential for serious systemic risk. Reasons for this conclusion include the inevitable lag between supervisors' identification of a problem and its ultimate correction, the incentives of management to find ways around regulation, and the time inconsistency problem which frequently makes forbearance look attractive.\n\nIf supervision and regulation, by itself, is unlikely to be sufficient, what is preferable? The response to this question brings us to the second type of banking policies I alluded to earlier, and also brings us to the substance of a book I co-authored (with Ron Feldman) in 2004, titled Too Big To Fail: The Hazards of Bank Bailouts.\n\nAs its title suggests, the book argues that too-big-to-fail (or too-interconnected-to-fail) protection of uninsured creditors of systemically important financial institutions distorts incentives and leads to underpricing of risk and therefore excessive risk-taking.

And when thinking about what policymakers should do to address TBTF going forward, we have argued that the recommendations we have made over the last several years offer a promising approach. 2/\nIn explaining the merits of our specific recommendations, we have noted that the analytical framework used in developing those recommendations seems widely accepted at this point. But agreement on a general policy framework may, quite reasonably, not strike observers as a compelling reason to adopt our recommendations; a general framework may be consistent with a large number of specific reforms. Seemingly more compelling would be an assessment indicating that these reforms would have been of appreciable benefit if implemented prior to the recent turmoil. Indeed, we are frequently asked, “Would your reforms have made a difference?” suggesting real and, we think, understandable doubt on the part of observers.\nI say “understandable” because we cannot truly know what might have ameliorated the many spillovers, particularly from one financial institution to another, that followed the collapse of the subprime lending market. In any case, policymakers have had to face developments in real time, not aspirations for what might have occurred, and as I indicated, I think the response was fully appropriate. That said, we would not have put forward recommendations if we did not think they would have provided benefits in the here and now. In particular, I will argue in this speech that these recommendations would have better prepared policymakers for the fallout that accompanied the weakening of systemically important financial firms. Such preparation may not have prevented the need for safety net expansion, but would have raised the odds that more narrow measures would have sufficed.\nIn the rest of these remarks, I first briefly describe recent Federal Reserve actions. I then provide some examples of recommended steps that would have led to better preparation in advance of the crisis. Finally, I offer some specific proposals for near-term adoption.\nRecent Federal Reserve Actions\nThe Federal Reserve has taken a wide range of extraordinary actions to respond to conditions in the financial markets over the last year or so. Given the tools available to the Federal Reserve and our mission, we have largely focused our efforts on increasing the availability of liquidity to financial institutions. Without trying to be comprehensive, I would note the following:\nWe have eased the terms of our discount window lending to traditional users, including reducing prices and lengthening maturities, for example. We have also rolled out new ways to provide this credit, including auctioning it off. More dramatically, we have allowed certain securities firms, the so-called primary dealers, to access our credit facilities. Finally, in two cases, we have used our lending powers to try to facilitate the orderly resolution of financial firms whose failure otherwise posed systemic risk.\nI could point to other actions, such as increasing our coordinated lending of dollars with other central banks, but suffice it to say the Federal Reserve has responded to unprecedented times with equally unprecedented actions. And, of course, we have lowered the federal funds rate target from 5 1/4 percent in September 2007 to 1 percent today. Such actions were appropriate given the challenges we faced, although I will comment soon about the downside associated with these policies.\nWe have seen some important progress in recent weeks in funding markets, due to these policy responses and due to related actions taken by other governmental institutions. That said, significant strains continue in some markets and among financial institutions. It is critical that the steps we have taken succeed in restoring stability. But as I noted, these actions have had the undesirable side effect of exacerbating the TBTF problem. Once immediate fires have been doused, policymakers will have to turn to reining in TBTF because, left unchecked, the TBTF embers remaining from our emergency response will likely contribute to future financial conflagrations. I now discuss some reforms to address TBTF that I think policymakers ought to consider seriously at that point.\nPolicies to Address TBTF\nI have long recommended that policymakers evaluate policies to address TBTF against their ability to appropriately reduce the likelihood that government will provide support to nominally uninsured creditors of large financial institutions. I believe that policymakers provide such support in order to limit the fallout, or spillovers, that arise when a large financial institution gets into trouble. So effective TBTF policies are those that allow policymakers to better manage the spillovers from the collapse or failure of a large financial firm. Based on recent public statements from a range of officials, I see a consensus emerging on this policy framework for addressing the TBTF problem.\nThis framework, however, does not provide sufficient detail to really guide policy. In prior work, we have provided a fairly extensive list of specific recommendations; more recently, we have offered a near-term plan with three specific reforms, which I will discuss later. These recommendations flow directly from the framework that policymakers seem comfortable with and thus are a good place to start.\nHowever, both implicit and explicit feedback we have received suggest some underlying doubt about the reforms recommended and the justification for them. Put simply, we have been asked the rhetorical equivalent of the following two questions:\nIf our reforms were so on-target, why were they not adopted in the first place?\nWould these reforms have actually made a difference to recent events?\nLet me try to respond to these questions.\nIn terms of the first question, it is clear that we viewed TBTF as a greater risk and higher priority than many. I am not precisely sure why, but I think there are good reasons why others did not have the same level of concern. Some may have viewed TBTF reforms as a poor use of scarce resources. Policymakers always have a large number of initiatives under way, but they can only give priority to a select few. In this context, recall that by virtually all measures, most of the largest financial institutions were in excellent condition prior to recent turmoil. So ex ante, other issues may have reasonably seemed more important even if, ex post, TBTF is now viewed as paramount.\nIn other cases, I think the answer lies, at least partly, in the belief that previously enacted reforms would make it both exceedingly difficult and unnecessary for policymakers to support uninsured creditors. Observers seemed to believe these reforms put creditors at risk of loss and obviated concerns about TBTF. In particular, we heard from many that the regime created by the 1991 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA) to limit TBTF support rendered our concerns about the scale and persistence of TBTF moot. Adherents of this view would not be expected to push efforts to fix TBTF to the top of the “to do” list.\nSuffice it to say that we had a different view on this topic, one which we have been fairly vocal about for some time. In short, we did not think that FDICIA reforms would, when push came to shove, act effectively as a limit on creditor expectations or on policymaker actions, and recent events, in large part, bear this out. For example, policymakers invoked FDICIA's so-called systemic risk exception when they provided unlimited deposit insurance on noninterest-bearing business accounts at all banks.3/ To the extent that these explanations provide the rationale for not enacting TBTF reforms previously, they no longer seem relevant, and thus we think that our recommendations are worthy of attention.\nIn terms of the second question, “Would the reforms have made a difference?” let me point to some representative examples suggesting that the reforms we recommended would have contributed to better preparation prior to the crisis.\nOne recommendation that would have increased preparedness for recent events concerns what we called scenario planning. We described key aspects of this reform as follows:\nPolicymakers could reduce the uncertainty that they face when a large bank fails by knowing the potential exposures other banks have to the failing institution in advance and practicing their response to such failures. … [Supervisors should examine] how the failure of one institution would affect the solvency of [other large banks]. … This amounts to checking out how much one bank … owes the others at a point in time—say, at the end of a business day. … [T]he government would focus on spillovers and cross-institution exposure. … Supervisors should develop detailed plans for addressing the failure of a large bank, test those procedures in simulations, and revise the procedures to account for test results. Supervisors should repeat the cycle regularly, given the rapidly changing operations of the largest banks. …\n[S]upervisors must identify the documents and data they will need to determine a bank's solvency and the exposures it would present to other banks at the time of failure. … Ultimately, supervisors must identify the gaps between what institutions can provide and what supervisors require. We view it as of the highest priority for supervisors to eliminate such gaps.4/\nThis approach would have been of considerable value when determining potential responses to the illiquidity and/or insolvency of specific large financial institutions over the last year. To be sure, such preparation may not have ultimately changed the need for significant policy action, but policymakers would have likely had a better understanding of the specific “interconnectedness” of large financial firms, suggesting that responses to the outcomes could have been more timely and better focused.\nIn particular, if we (as policymakers) had grasped the net of connections of large financial firms in, say, 2006 instead of 2008, we might have taken steps to figure out how to contain the ability of this network to spread risk. For example, policymakers have now identified the absence of an effective resolution scheme as a major weakness in addressing the spillovers created when large nonbank financial firms get into trouble. This absence and a desire to contain these spillovers explain, in part, the extraordinary support such firms ultimately received. It is likely that the type of exploration we advocated would have raised the visibility of this problem.\nIn a second recommendation, we emphasized the importance of communicating and signaling to creditors their likely treatment in the resolution of institutions they might consider TBTF. We have been clear that policymakers need to “anchor” the expectations of these creditors to avoid surprising them with the eventual support that may, or may not, be forthcoming. Some observers have attributed the deterioration of credit and financial market conditions over the last several months to surprises that creditors of large institutions experienced.5/\nIn a third example, we encouraged policymakers to consider new capital regimes that would have enhanced bank capital positions in bad times by locking in the ability to raise capital in the future.6/ At the time we highlighted it, we noted that this proposal may not have been practicable, and it still might not be. But certainly many observers have concluded that a more “procyclical” capital regime would have better addressed the recent turmoil than the one currently in place.7/\nThere are other recommendations we could mention. For example, we identified the benefits of increasing the use of centralized clearinghouses for derivative markets and stressed the importance of resolution schemes that could quickly make payments to uninsured creditors of the funds owed them by the failing institution.8/\nAgain, I should stress that even with adoption of our recommendations, recent events might have unfolded largely as they did. Better preparation would not have changed the cause of our current financial troubles, though it almost certainly would have altered the effect, because better preparation makes for better policy. That said, we recognize that some recommendations we have made in the past have not held up. And I certainly make no claim for having foreseen how the decline in housing prices would spill over so aggressively to the financial sector and real economy. Finally, others did implement select reforms to address TBTF, which they identified with no help from us.\nThese caveats notwithstanding, by the standard of these two direct questions, our previously articulated reforms clearly have merit and deserve a second look. So where should policymakers start?\nSystemic Focused Supervision\nHaving recognized the value of establishing priorities in my previous comments, I have tried to impose the same discipline on myself. We would begin the effort to manage TBTF with an approach we call systemic focused supervision (SFS). I have detailed this plan elsewhere, so let me just hit the main points here.9/ In general, SFS attempts to focus supervision and regulation efforts on reduction of spillovers, and it consists of three pillars: early identification, enhanced prompt corrective action (PCA) and stability-related communication.\nEarly identification. This is a process to identify and to respond, where appropriate, to the material exposures among large financial institutions and between these institutions and capital markets. This process relates closely to the scenario planning recommendation I discussed a few moments ago. The goals of the exercise I described are (1) to give policymakers a sense of which events are not likely to severely impair a large financial institution, thus permitting them to avoid providing support, and (2) to identify those exposures that might bring down the firm, and thus are deserving of closer policy scrutiny and, most importantly, an effective and timely response.\nEnhanced prompt corrective action. PCA works by requiring supervisors to take specified actions against a bank as its capital falls below specified triggers. Closing banks while they still have positive capital, or at most a small loss, can reduce spillovers in a fairly direct way. If a bank's failure does not impose large losses, by definition it cannot directly threaten the viability of other depository institutions that have exposure to it. Thus, the PCA regime offers an important tool to manage systemic risk. However, this regime currently uses triggers that do not adequately account for future losses and gives too much discretion to bank management. We would augment the triggers with more forward-looking data outside the control of bank management to address these concerns.\nCommunication. The first two pillars of SFS seek to increase market discipline by reducing the motivation policymakers have for protecting creditors. But creditors will not know about efforts to limit spillovers, and therefore will not change their expectations of support, absent explicit communication by policymakers about these efforts.\nConclusion\nRecent events have been unprecedented. I'm skeptical of claims that the Federal Reserve or anyone else should have foreseen the situation as it actually played out. I also strongly support the actions the Federal Reserve has taken in response to these events, even with the undesired side effect of intensifying the TBTF problem. A significant issue, though, is what reforms should policymakers introduce to address the magnified TBTF problem? One criterion is that we consider reforms that would have helped prepare policymakers for the financial fallout they have faced over the last year or so, and it is my conviction that several reforms I have previously articulated fit that bill.\nEndnotes\n1/ Policymakers have made this point directly.

In any case, policymakers have had to face developments in real time, not aspirations for what might have occurred, and as I indicated, I think the response was fully appropriate. That said, we would not have put forward recommendations if we did not think they would have provided benefits in the here and now. In particular, I will argue in this speech that these recommendations would have better prepared policymakers for the fallout that accompanied the weakening of systemically important financial firms. Such preparation may not have prevented the need for safety net expansion, but would have raised the odds that more narrow measures would have sufficed.\n\nIn the rest of these remarks, I first briefly describe recent Federal Reserve actions. I then provide some examples of recommended steps that would have led to better preparation in advance of the crisis. Finally, I offer some specific proposals for near-term adoption.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has taken a wide range of extraordinary actions to respond to conditions in the financial markets over the last year or so. Given the tools available to the Federal Reserve and our mission, we have largely focused our efforts on increasing the availability of liquidity to financial institutions. Without trying to be comprehensive, I would note the following:\n\nWe have eased the terms of our discount window lending to traditional users, including reducing prices and lengthening maturities, for example. We have also rolled out new ways to provide this credit, including auctioning it off. More dramatically, we have allowed certain securities firms, the so-called primary dealers, to access our credit facilities. Finally, in two cases, we have used our lending powers to try to facilitate the orderly resolution of financial firms whose failure otherwise posed systemic risk.\n\nI could point to other actions, such as increasing our coordinated lending of dollars with other central banks, but suffice it to say the Federal Reserve has responded to unprecedented times with equally unprecedented actions. And, of course, we have lowered the federal funds rate target from 5 1/4 percent in September 2007 to 1 percent today. Such actions were appropriate given the challenges we faced, although I will comment soon about the downside associated with these policies.\n\nWe have seen some important progress in recent weeks in funding markets, due to these policy responses and due to related actions taken by other governmental institutions. That said, significant strains continue in some markets and among financial institutions. It is critical that the steps we have taken succeed in restoring stability. But as I noted, these actions have had the undesirable side effect of exacerbating the TBTF problem. Once immediate fires have been doused, policymakers will have to turn to reining in TBTF because, left unchecked, the TBTF embers remaining from our emergency response will likely contribute to future financial conflagrations. I now discuss some reforms to address TBTF that I think policymakers ought to consider seriously at that point.\n\nI have long recommended that policymakers evaluate policies to address TBTF against their ability to appropriately reduce the likelihood that government will provide support to nominally uninsured creditors of large financial institutions. I believe that policymakers provide such support in order to limit the fallout, or spillovers, that arise when a large financial institution gets into trouble. So effective TBTF policies are those that allow policymakers to better manage the spillovers from the collapse or failure of a large financial firm. Based on recent public statements from a range of officials, I see a consensus emerging on this policy framework for addressing the TBTF problem.\n\nThis framework, however, does not provide sufficient detail to really guide policy. In prior work, we have provided a fairly extensive list of specific recommendations; more recently, we have offered a near-term plan with three specific reforms, which I will discuss later. These recommendations flow directly from the framework that policymakers seem comfortable with and thus are a good place to start.\n\nHowever, both implicit and explicit feedback we have received suggest some underlying doubt about the reforms recommended and the justification for them. Put simply, we have been asked the rhetorical equivalent of the following two questions:\n\nLet me try to respond to these questions.\n\nIn terms of the first question, it is clear that we viewed TBTF as a greater risk and higher priority than many. I am not precisely sure why, but I think there are good reasons why others did not have the same level of concern. Some may have viewed TBTF reforms as a poor use of scarce resources. Policymakers always have a large number of initiatives under way, but they can only give priority to a select few. In this context, recall that by virtually all measures, most of the largest financial institutions were in excellent condition prior to recent turmoil. So ex ante, other issues may have reasonably seemed more important even if, ex post, TBTF is now viewed as paramount.\n\nIn other cases, I think the answer lies, at least partly, in the belief that previously enacted reforms would make it both exceedingly difficult and unnecessary for policymakers to support uninsured creditors. Observers seemed to believe these reforms put creditors at risk of loss and obviated concerns about TBTF. In particular, we heard from many that the regime created by the 1991 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA) to limit TBTF support rendered our concerns about the scale and persistence of TBTF moot. Adherents of this view would not be expected to push efforts to fix TBTF to the top of the “to do” list.\n\nSuffice it to say that we had a different view on this topic, one which we have been fairly vocal about for some time. In short, we did not think that FDICIA reforms would, when push came to shove, act effectively as a limit on creditor expectations or on policymaker actions, and recent events, in large part, bear this out. For example, policymakers invoked FDICIA's so-called systemic risk exception when they provided unlimited deposit insurance on noninterest-bearing business accounts at all banks.3/ To the extent that these explanations provide the rationale for not enacting TBTF reforms previously, they no longer seem relevant, and thus we think that our recommendations are worthy of attention.\n\nIn terms of the second question, “Would the reforms have made a difference?” let me point to some representative examples suggesting that the reforms we recommended would have contributed to better preparation prior to the crisis.\n\nOne recommendation that would have increased preparedness for recent events concerns what we called scenario planning. We described key aspects of this reform as follows:\n\nThis approach would have been of considerable value when determining potential responses to the illiquidity and/or insolvency of specific large financial institutions over the last year. To be sure, such preparation may not have ultimately changed the need for significant policy action, but policymakers would have likely had a better understanding of the specific “interconnectedness” of large financial firms, suggesting that responses to the outcomes could have been more timely and better focused.\n\nIn particular, if we (as policymakers) had grasped the net of connections of large financial firms in, say, 2006 instead of 2008, we might have taken steps to figure out how to contain the ability of this network to spread risk. For example, policymakers have now identified the absence of an effective resolution scheme as a major weakness in addressing the spillovers created when large nonbank financial firms get into trouble. This absence and a desire to contain these spillovers explain, in part, the extraordinary support such firms ultimately received. It is likely that the type of exploration we advocated would have raised the visibility of this problem.\n\nIn a second recommendation, we emphasized the importance of communicating and signaling to creditors their likely treatment in the resolution of institutions they might consider TBTF. We have been clear that policymakers need to “anchor” the expectations of these creditors to avoid surprising them with the eventual support that may, or may not, be forthcoming. Some observers have attributed the deterioration of credit and financial market conditions over the last several months to surprises that creditors of large institutions experienced.5/\n\nIn a third example, we encouraged policymakers to consider new capital regimes that would have enhanced bank capital positions in bad times by locking in the ability to raise capital in the future.6/ At the time we highlighted it, we noted that this proposal may not have been practicable, and it still might not be. But certainly many observers have concluded that a more “procyclical” capital regime would have better addressed the recent turmoil than the one currently in place.7/\n\nThere are other recommendations we could mention. For example, we identified the benefits of increasing the use of centralized clearinghouses for derivative markets and stressed the importance of resolution schemes that could quickly make payments to uninsured creditors of the funds owed them by the failing institution.8/\n\nAgain, I should stress that even with adoption of our recommendations, recent events might have unfolded largely as they did. Better preparation would not have changed the cause of our current financial troubles, though it almost certainly would have altered the effect, because better preparation makes for better policy. That said, we recognize that some recommendations we have made in the past have not held up. And I certainly make no claim for having foreseen how the decline in housing prices would spill over so aggressively to the financial sector and real economy. Finally, others did implement select reforms to address TBTF, which they identified with no help from us.\n\nThese caveats notwithstanding, by the standard of these two direct questions, our previously articulated reforms clearly have merit and deserve a second look. So where should policymakers start?\n\nHaving recognized the value of establishing priorities in my previous comments, I have tried to impose the same discipline on myself. We would begin the effort to manage TBTF with an approach we call systemic focused supervision (SFS). I have detailed this plan elsewhere, so let me just hit the main points here.9/ In general, SFS attempts to focus supervision and regulation efforts on reduction of spillovers, and it consists of three pillars: early identification, enhanced prompt corrective action (PCA) and stability-related communication.\n\nEarly identification. This is a process to identify and to respond, where appropriate, to the material exposures among large financial institutions and between these institutions and capital markets. This process relates closely to the scenario planning recommendation I discussed a few moments ago. The goals of the exercise I described are (1) to give policymakers a sense of which events are not likely to severely impair a large financial institution, thus permitting them to avoid providing support, and (2) to identify those exposures that might bring down the firm, and thus are deserving of closer policy scrutiny and, most importantly, an effective and timely response.\n\nEnhanced prompt corrective action. PCA works by requiring supervisors to take specified actions against a bank as its capital falls below specified triggers. Closing banks while they still have positive capital, or at most a small loss, can reduce spillovers in a fairly direct way. If a bank's failure does not impose large losses, by definition it cannot directly threaten the viability of other depository institutions that have exposure to it. Thus, the PCA regime offers an important tool to manage systemic risk. However, this regime currently uses triggers that do not adequately account for future losses and gives too much discretion to bank management. We would augment the triggers with more forward-looking data outside the control of bank management to address these concerns.\n\nCommunication. The first two pillars of SFS seek to increase market discipline by reducing the motivation policymakers have for protecting creditors. But creditors will not know about efforts to limit spillovers, and therefore will not change their expectations of support, absent explicit communication by policymakers about these efforts.\n\nRecent events have been unprecedented. I'm skeptical of claims that the Federal Reserve or anyone else should have foreseen the situation as it actually played out. I also strongly support the actions the Federal Reserve has taken in response to these events, even with the undesired side effect of intensifying the TBTF problem. A significant issue, though, is what reforms should policymakers introduce to address the magnified TBTF problem? One criterion is that we consider reforms that would have helped prepare policymakers for the financial fallout they have faced over the last year or so, and it is my conviction that several reforms I have previously articulated fit that bill.\n\n1/ Policymakers have made this point directly. See, for example, Kate Gibson and Greg Robb, “Bernanke Sees Long Slowdown, but Still Confident,” Market Watch, Oct. 15, 2008. Recent press accounts also highlight the importance of TBTF. For example, see Cheyenne Hopkins, “Big Policy Choices Face New President,” American Banker, Nov. 5, 2008. See also Bob Davis, Jonathan Weisman and Timothy Aeppel, “New Economic Ills Will Force Winner's Hand,” Wall Street Journal, Nov. 4, 2008.\n\n2/ Many of these recommendations are developed in Gary H. Stern and Ron J. Feldman, Too Big to Fail: The Hazards of Bank Bailouts (Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution Press, 2004).\n\n3/ Policymakers invoked the so-called systemic risk exception of FDICIA in creating the FDIC's “Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program” and in the context of the proposed acquisition of Wachovia Corp. by Citicorp Inc. See FDIC press releases 100-2008 and 88-2008, respectively. In contrast, policymakers did not invoke the exception in the failures of IndyMac Bank, F.S.B., and Washington Mutual Bank despite the large size of these two depositories (see FDIC press releases 56-2008 and 85-2008).\n\n4/ See Stern and Feldman, pages 112 and 114.

I want to spend some time this evening describing this response, the implications of financial developments for the economy, and the role of fluctuations in asset prices in our recent experience. This is a lot of ground to cover, and so necessarily many details and nuances will be skipped. These, hopefully, can be addressed in the subsequent question and answer session. And the usual caveat applies: I am speaking only for myself and not for others in the Federal Reserve.\nThe Federal Reserve Response\nThe financial disruptions we have witnessed for more than a year now began in the market for subprime mortgages but ultimately engulfed much of the credit system, with the turmoil intensifying over the summer and through early fall. Against this background, the Federal Reserve has undertaken a wide range of significant actions intended to restore stability. Given the tools available to the Federal Reserve and our mission, we have largely focused our efforts on increasing the availability of liquidity to financial institutions. Without trying to be comprehensive, I would note the following:\nWe have added liquidity by easing the terms of our discount window lending to traditional borrowers, including reducing prices and lengthening maturities, for example. We have also rolled out new ways to provide this credit, including auctioning it off. In addition we have allowed certain securities firms, the so-called primary dealers, to access our credit facilities. Finally, in two cases, we used our lending powers to facilitate the orderly resolution of financial firms whose failure otherwise posed systemic risk.\nI could point to other actions, such as increasing our coordinated lending of dollars with other central banks and prospective entry into the commercial paper market, but suffice it to say the Federal Reserve has responded to unprecedented times with equally unprecedented actions. And, of course, we have reduced the Federal funds rate target from 5 1/4 percent in September '07 to 1 1/2 percent today.\nDespite these initiatives, financial markets remain unsettled, and some institutions continue to experience funding pressures. Restoration of stability has not yet been achieved and, to add to the challenge, the too-big-to-fail (TBTF) problem, with which I have long been concerned, has been exacerbated by some of the actions taken to foster stability. These actions were fully appropriate against the background of the risks at hand, and it is critical that they succeed; nevertheless, at some point policymakers will have to turn their attention to reining in TBTF because, if left unchecked, it is likely to contribute to future instability.\nI have proposed, and I have spoken previously at some length about, a program called 'systemic focused supervision' (SFS) to begin to accomplish this objective. That is a topic for another day, except for two points that I want to reiterate here: First, at the end of the day SFS is all about preparation and timely action. The underlying idea is, before severe problems arise, to identify potential vulnerabilities and spillovers - that is, to try to determine how the weakness of one large or systemically important financial institution will affect other financial firms and the real economy before the former actually gets into difficulty. SFS would also have regulators close financial institutions early, before they can impose too large a loss on peers, by enhancing the so-called prompt corrective action regime with more forward-looking market data. And specific, regular communication is also a necessary component of SFS, in order to prepare creditors for the change in regime and to encourage changes in their expectations and behavior. Second, policies with the ingredients of SFS are likely to be essential if we are to restore a stable, market-driven financial system.\nFinancial Conditions and the Economy\nFor now, let me consider the implications of the financial disruptions, and the response to them, for the economy. Despite the deterioration in financial conditions, the economy grew better than 2 percent last year and about 1 3/4 percent (at an annual rate) over the first half of this year. But these numbers for real GDP do not tell the whole story. Nationwide, employment has dropped every month this year. Housing construction and prices of residential units continue to decline, and the inventory of unsold, unoccupied properties remains substantial. The sharp drop in equity values, along with the course of home prices, has reduced household wealth, and marked deterioration in credit market conditions has added to the cost and difficulty of obtaining funding.\nIn this environment, consumer spending, which has softened in recent months, seems likely to remain subdued. As I have suggested on other occasions, there are discernible similarities between current circumstances and those prevailing in the early 1990s, during the so-called financial 'headwinds' episode. In that period, credit became expensive and in some cases, unavailable, even for relatively high quality borrowers. Indeed, in view of the scope and severity of the recent financial shock, the restraint on economic activity stemming from credit market headwinds could exceed the experience of the 1990s.\nI would, however, be cautious about this conclusion, for several reasons. First, many 'initial conditions' prevailing prior to the current financial shock were perceptibly better than in the early 1990s. Unemployment, interest rates, and inflation were all lower at the outset of the latest period of turmoil than in the previous headwinds episode. Equally important, the financial condition of both most banking and nonfinancial businesses was relatively healthier at the outset of recent problems.\nSecond, the policy response, including the Treasury program to purchase troubled assets from financial institutions and to inject capital into banking firms, as well as the extension of deposit insurance, is substantial and far-reaching. As I perceive the environment today, some financial assets are being traded infrequently if at all, implying that their price, and value as collateral, is highly uncertain. This circumstance calls into question the capital position and viability of those institutions that hold such assets in volume. Thus, market participants are unsure of the value of collateral and the financial condition of counterparties, completing a vicious circle which has contributed to the reluctance to trade and to fund firms except on a very short-term basis.\nThe Treasury program, properly implemented, will improve capital positions and help to establish values for assets currently locked up. And the actions the Federal Reserve has taken have aimed to ameliorate the funding issues which have arisen in this challenging environment.\nIt has long been presumed that the commercial banking system was, and would function as, the backup source of liquidity for other institutions - financial and nonfinancial alike - in times of stress. Banks are, to some extent at least, playing this role again; as former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker remarked recently, 'Everybody is running back to Mother, the commercial banking system.' But the banking system's capacity to fulfill this role is strained, in part because of losses some institutions sustained as a consequence of positions in the assets in question and in part because the so-called 'shadow banking system' grew so large relative to traditional institutions.\nAll of this is to suggest that it likely will take time for confidence in collateral values, capital positions, and counterparties to be restored; from my perspective, the financial headwinds experience of the early 1990s remains relevant. With that reference point, it seems that for the near term we should anticipate further declines in employment and softness in most components of demand for goods and services, together with a diminution of inflation as the bulge in energy and other commodity prices is apparently behind us.\nIt is worth recalling that the economic recession of 1990-91 was brief but not especially mild: real GDP declined more than 2 percent (annual rate) over the three quarters ending in the first quarter of 1991 and consumer spending dropped perceptibly during that period. Depending on how one reads the data, financial headwinds restrained the pace of the ensuing expansion of the early 1990s for from 12 to 36 months. Something similar is certainly conceivable today. At the same time, we should bear in mind that, current travails notwithstanding, the underlying flexibility and resilience of the economy are intact, as are its human and physical capital, and these characteristics should ultimately prevail to restore solid growth.\nAsset Prices\nEarly in these remarks, I noted in passing that the recent financial shock originated in the market for subprime mortgages. It will take some time to comprehensively analyze and to understand the underlying sources of the problem, and surely more than enough 'culprits' contributed to the turmoil. But one significant factor appears to have been the (formerly) widely held conviction that house prices across the country would rise rapidly and uninterruptedly; many transactions would have worked out satisfactorily had this been the case. This observation brings us to the last issue I want to raise this evening, and which I have considered previously, namely the role of asset price fluctuations in economic performance and in policy formulation.\nChanges in home prices and equity values, two principal items on the household balance sheet, exert so-called wealth effects on consumer spending, which is to say that while such spending depends mainly on after-tax income, wealth influences outlays as well. While policymakers have acknowledged that asset price excesses and their subsequent correction can potentially have meaningful consequences for the economy, they generally have preferred to try to cushion the repercussions of an asset price collapse rather than to address an asset price run-up in its early stages. There are, to be sure, good reasons for this attitude, having to do with the difficulty of identifying asset 'bubbles' in a timely way, the need to build public support for action, and the challenge of weighing the costs and benefits of action for the broad economy. Nevertheless, in view of the damage resulting from the decline in housing values, as well as the aftermath of the collapse of prices of technology stocks earlier this decade, I think it essential to revisit these issues.\nIdentification of excesses in asset prices, although challenging, does not appear to be beyond the realm of possibility. There is some work in academic circles, and at least some practitioners agree, that when common ratios (the ratio of stock prices to earnings or dividends, for example, or the ratio of housing values to rents) exceed the bounds of historical experience, it is likely that a price correction will follow, although its timing is unpredictable. It would seem likely that misidentification will occur occasionally and, in particular, that some events may be classified as bubbles when they are not. The implication of this possibility is, in my view, to ensure that the policy response to a perceived excess in asset prices is measured, so that even if in error the ramifications for the economy will be modest.\nThis consideration illustrates, perhaps, the critical issue in addressing asset price excesses. When all is said and done, will the benefits outweigh the costs, assuming policymakers have made the correct identification? Monetary policy, for which we in the Federal Reserve are responsible, is a blunt instrument with economy-wide effects. We should not pretend that actions taken to rein in those asset price increases which seemingly outstrip economic fundamentals won't in the short run curtail to some extent economic growth and employment; after all, such actions are likely to require raising interest rates earlier and probably more than otherwise would be the case. There is a trade-off here, involving short-run costs in exchange for the benefits of greater stability and growth in the long run. Before taking action, policymakers need to weigh these elements carefully.\nFurther, monetary policy is not made in a vacuum; the central bank must have public support for the actions it pursues, and it is easy to imagine resistance to concerns about asset price levels. Nevertheless, as the anti-inflation experience of 1979-82, for example, illustrates, it is possible to build considerable support (as Paul Volcker did), or at least tolerance, for policies that some considered risky and unappealing.\nConclusion\nI have tried to cover a lot of ground this evening, in part because these are far from normal times. Before turning to your comments and questions, let me highlight just three points in concluding: 1) the financial disruptions we have experienced have important implications for the performance of the economy, and the headwinds episode of the early 1990s provides a useful reference point for thinking about what we might expect going forward; 2) the actions taken by the Treasury, Federal Reserve, FDIC, and others should, with time, improve market liquidity and the availability of credit; and 3) it has proven difficult and costly to deal with the aftermath of excesses in asset prices. As a consequence, it would seem wise to devote more resources both to the accurate identification of asset price bubbles and to consideration of appropriate policy actions upon such identification.\n\nIn the economic realm, the past 14 months have been characterized first and foremost by a severe and extensive financial shock, which has provoked, among other things, an extraordinary response from the Federal Reserve and from other policymakers as well. I want to spend some time this evening describing this response, the implications of financial developments for the economy, and the role of fluctuations in asset prices in our recent experience.

It will take some time to comprehensively analyze and to understand the underlying sources of the problem, and surely more than enough 'culprits' contributed to the turmoil. But one significant factor appears to have been the (formerly) widely held conviction that house prices across the country would rise rapidly and uninterruptedly; many transactions would have worked out satisfactorily had this been the case. This observation brings us to the last issue I want to raise this evening, and which I have considered previously, namely the role of asset price fluctuations in economic performance and in policy formulation.\n\nChanges in home prices and equity values, two principal items on the household balance sheet, exert so-called wealth effects on consumer spending, which is to say that while such spending depends mainly on after-tax income, wealth influences outlays as well. While policymakers have acknowledged that asset price excesses and their subsequent correction can potentially have meaningful consequences for the economy, they generally have preferred to try to cushion the repercussions of an asset price collapse rather than to address an asset price run-up in its early stages. There are, to be sure, good reasons for this attitude, having to do with the difficulty of identifying asset 'bubbles' in a timely way, the need to build public support for action, and the challenge of weighing the costs and benefits of action for the broad economy. Nevertheless, in view of the damage resulting from the decline in housing values, as well as the aftermath of the collapse of prices of technology stocks earlier this decade, I think it essential to revisit these issues.\n\nIdentification of excesses in asset prices, although challenging, does not appear to be beyond the realm of possibility. There is some work in academic circles, and at least some practitioners agree, that when common ratios (the ratio of stock prices to earnings or dividends, for example, or the ratio of housing values to rents) exceed the bounds of historical experience, it is likely that a price correction will follow, although its timing is unpredictable. It would seem likely that misidentification will occur occasionally and, in particular, that some events may be classified as bubbles when they are not. The implication of this possibility is, in my view, to ensure that the policy response to a perceived excess in asset prices is measured, so that even if in error the ramifications for the economy will be modest.\n\nThis consideration illustrates, perhaps, the critical issue in addressing asset price excesses. When all is said and done, will the benefits outweigh the costs, assuming policymakers have made the correct identification? Monetary policy, for which we in the Federal Reserve are responsible, is a blunt instrument with economy-wide effects. We should not pretend that actions taken to rein in those asset price increases which seemingly outstrip economic fundamentals won't in the short run curtail to some extent economic growth and employment; after all, such actions are likely to require raising interest rates earlier and probably more than otherwise would be the case. There is a trade-off here, involving short-run costs in exchange for the benefits of greater stability and growth in the long run. Before taking action, policymakers need to weigh these elements carefully.\n\nFurther, monetary policy is not made in a vacuum; the central bank must have public support for the actions it pursues, and it is easy to imagine resistance to concerns about asset price levels. Nevertheless, as the anti-inflation experience of 1979-82, for example, illustrates, it is possible to build considerable support (as Paul Volcker did), or at least tolerance, for policies that some considered risky and unappealing.\n\nI have tried to cover a lot of ground this evening, in part because these are far from normal times. Before turning to your comments and questions, let me highlight just three points in concluding: 1) the financial disruptions we have experienced have important implications for the performance of the economy, and the headwinds episode of the early 1990s provides a useful reference point for thinking about what we might expect going forward; 2) the actions taken by the Treasury, Federal Reserve, FDIC, and others should, with time, improve market liquidity and the availability of credit; and 3) it has proven difficult and costly to deal with the aftermath of excesses in asset prices. As a consequence, it would seem wise to devote more resources both to the accurate identification of asset price bubbles and to consideration of appropriate policy actions upon such identification."

The disruptions intensified over the summer and persist to this day, despite considerable injections of liquidity on our part and other actions intended to ameliorate the situation. Indeed, the Federal Reserve has undertaken a wide range of extraordinary actions to respond to conditions in the financial markets over the last year or so. Given the tools available to the Federal Reserve and our mission, we have largely focused our efforts on increasing the availability of liquidity to financial institutions. Without trying to be comprehensive, I would note the following:\nWe have added liquidity by easing the terms of our discount window lending to traditional users including reducing prices and lengthening maturities for example. We have also rolled out new ways to provide this credit including auctioning it off. More dramatically we have allowed certain securities firms, the so-called primary dealers, to access our credit facilities. Finally, in two cases, we used our lending powers to facilitate the orderly resolution of financial firms whose failure otherwise posed systemic risks.\n\nI could point to other actions, such as increasing our coordinated lending of dollars with other central banks and prospective entry into the commercial paper market, but suffice it to say the Federal Reserve has responded to unprecedented times with equally unprecedented actions. And, of course, we have reduced the Federal funds rate target from 5 1/4 percent in September 2007 to 1 1/2 percent today.\nMaking progress against the turmoil at hand is certainly the top priority at this stage. But soon enough policymakers will want to identify fundamental reforms that reduce the likelihood that we will face another period of financial instability. In this spirit, in my comments this afternoon I want to consider the repercussions of this turmoil from two distinct perspectives: first, I want to discuss its implications for regulatory, supervisory, and financial stability policies going forward; and, second, I want to consider its implications for the current and prospective economic environment.\nTo preview my major themes, I will suggest that the too-big-to-fail (TBTF) problem, with which I have long been concerned, has been exacerbated by actions taken over the past year to bolster financial stability. These actions were fully appropriate against the background of the risks at hand, and it is essential that they succeed, but going forward they will require policies to address spillovers and to reduce the likelihood of full protection of uninsured creditors of large, complex financial institutions. I will elaborate specific proposals in a few minutes, but let me underscore one point: it is critical that we address TBTF because, if left unchecked, it could well be a major source of future instability.\nAs to economic prospects, I have been convinced for some time that financial conditions in the wake of the shock are reminiscent of, although certainly not identical to, those prevailing during the “headwinds” episode of the early 1990s. At the least, that experience provides a useful framework for analysis of the current state of the credit markets, the economy, and intermediate-term prospects. And before proceeding further, let me also remind you of the usual caveat: I am speaking only for myself and not for others in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Expanded Safety Net and Too-Big-To-Fail\nIn our Bank's 2007 annual report, I expressed concern about the expansion of the safety net for large financial firms and, particularly, its potential to dull the market forces that would otherwise serve to constrain excessive risk taking. Although the annual report essay was released just a few months ago, the financial safety net has expanded appreciably since then. The dimensions of the too-big-to-fail problem have increased once again.\nAt the same time, however, there has been progress in beginning to develop a policy framework to address TBTF and to enhance market discipline. Policymakers have begun to focus more explicitly on minimizing the fallout, or “spillovers,” from a financial firm's impairment as they consider how to improve financial stability and to reduce the moral hazard incentives for excessive risk taking inherent in TBTF.\nNaturally, I view these latter developments positively. In 2004 I co-authored, with Ron Feldman, a book entitled Too Big to Fail, the Hazards of Bank Bailouts. In that work, we emphasized that “policymakers should give highest priority to reforms limiting the chance that one bank's failure will threaten the solvency of other banks.” We came to that conclusion using the following logic:\nPolicymakers provide financial support to weak but systemically important financial firms to contain spillovers;\nReducing the fallout from financial firm failures undermines the principal rationale for extraordinary government support;\nCreditor expectations of receiving government support will diminish (and market discipline will increase) as policymakers have less reason to provide such support.\nThis reasoning can contribute to agreement on a general policy framework to address TBTF, but such a framework is not a sufficient base for reform. Government agencies charged with addressing instability and related TBTF concerns, and private sector groups and firms critical to that effort, require specific recommendations. We have long had a list of specific reforms to address TBTF, but heretofore we have not prioritized those proposals. So of the many recommendations we made, where would we have policymakers start? We would begin the effort to manage TBTF with an approach we call systemic focused supervision (SFS).\nSystemic Focused Supervision\nIn general, SFS attempts to focus supervision and regulation efforts on spillover reduction, and it consists of three pillars: early identification, enhanced prompt corrective action (PCA), and stability-related communication. In particular, SFS uses the information-gathering and analytical skills of supervisors to better understand how one firm's impairment might spread to other firms or markets; it relies on the enforcement capabilities of regulation (combined with market information) to close firms before they incur losses that could bring down their peers; and it extends central bank communication techniques to financial-stability-related efforts.\nThis program builds on the strength and current direction of supervision and regulation to focus across firms and on the interconnections in the banking and financial system as a whole, rather than concentrating on supervisory assessment of single firms. Combined, these efforts constitute important actions in a long-term effort to limit the spillovers from the failure or impairment of a systemically important financial institution. Let me now describe what I see as the basics of the three components.\nEarly Identification. This is a process to identify and to respond, where appropriate, to the material exposures between large financial institutions and between these institutions and capital markets. By material, we mean a sufficient exposure such that problems at one of these financial institutions could significantly impair other depository institutions and/or normal market functions.\nEarly identification could take many forms. Supervisors might begin by examining the performance of a number of large financial institutions subject to a series of shocks. The shocks could include large losses to a given type of loan or security on the firms' balance sheet, or a significant drop in the availability of funding. The results of this examination would provide policymakers with a sense of which stresses lead to significant problems at the firms. A second step is to determine how the material difficulties of one of these large institutions would affect the others. At a minimum, this would involve determining how much the failing institution owes the others at the end of the business day, what form the exposure takes, how much the exposure varies over time, and so on.\nThe goals of the exercise I just described (1) to give policymakers a sense of the type of events that are not likely to cause severe impairment, thus permitting them to avoid support and (2) to identify those exposures that might bring down the firm, and thus are deserving of closer policy scrutiny and response. As an essential part of this effort, supervisors should consider how they will make assessments of spillover potential at the time a financial institution experiences serious difficulty. Supervisors must determine what type of information they will need in short order from financial institutions during a period of turmoil, what information they can actually get, and develop a plan to address gaps that are identified. Closing these gaps means that policymakers can make informed judgments at the time of failure and, where possible, identify and resolve those issues that would otherwise lead to provision of extraordinary support.\nEnhanced Prompt Corrective Action. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 implemented PCA. Like many so-called “structured early intervention and resolution (SEIR)” regimes, PCA works by requiring supervisors to take prespecified actions against a bank as its capital falls below certain levels. A bank whose capital declines below a given level, for example, would have its ability to pay dividends constrained. In the extreme, chartering authorities will close banks whose capital levels fall below the lowest established trigger and who cannot raise additional capital.\nClosing banks while they still have positive capital, or at most a small loss, can reduce spillovers in a fairly direct way. If a bank's failure does not impose large losses, by definition it cannot directly threaten the viability of other institutions that have exposure to it. Thus, PCA is an important tool to manage systemic risk.\nHowever, many observers, including some of the most zealous advocates of using a SEIR regime in the United States, view PCA as inadequate because it relies, in great part, on the so-called book value of capital. This capital measure, particularly for bank loans, often reflects a “rearview mirror” or historical assessment of the bank's assets. Such assessments may, at times, prove excessively generous. Using PCA triggers based on more forward-looking measures of bank solvency could help to address this shortcoming.\nData from financial markets offer one source of forward looking measures of a bank's condition; market participants do not always get their forecast right but they do appear to incorporate assessments of the future prospects of firms in their pricing decisions. This suggests that an enhanced PCA regime relying on both book value capital and market measures of risk—such as subordinated debt spreads, prices of credit default swaps, and/or equity values, among others—would enhance the current regime. In fact, the original proposals for SEIR in the U.S. used market measures of bank net worth to provoke supervisory action. In practice this could mean that some combination of market signals and accounting measures of insolvency could lead to the timely closure of a bank.\nIncorporating market signals into PCA certainly has potential downsides. Like other reforms that increase market discipline, enhanced PCA may force firms into resolution, and potentially into the sale of troubled assets, precisely when the financial system seems most vulnerable. This observation suggests the need to average market measures over time to smooth out short-run volatility, or to rely on peer comparisons, for example, so as to avoid overreaction. I would also note that enhanced PCA assumes a bank-like resolution regime, something that does not yet exist outside of the banking venue.\nCommunication. The first two pillars of SFS seek to focus supervision and to increase market discipline. But creditors will not know about efforts to limit spillovers, and will not change their expectations of support, absent explicit communication by policymakers about these activities. What form might that communication take?\nIn general, we have suggested that this communication possess several attributes. First, it should be released routinely, like the semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, so that interested parties can rely on it. Second, it should disclose information on stability related activity at an early stage, even if it is work in progress. Such a strategy would provide creditors with a richer sense of the changes underway. Finally, we think the communication should explicitly link the activity underway to the goal of reducing spillovers, thus raising the feasibility and prudence of putting creditors at greater risk of loss.\n\nIf we take a step back and reflect on these proposals, at the end of the day SFS is all about preparation—preparation from two distinct, but closely-related, perspectives. The underlying idea is, before severe problems arise, to identify potential vulnerabilities and spillovers, and to select market signals to enhance PCA. And, secondly, specific, regular communication is necessary to prepare creditors for the change in regime and to encourage changes in their expectations and behavior.\nThe general cross-institution focus of SFS has similarities to what is often called macro prudential supervision. But just as I view SFS as building on current trends in safety and soundness supervision, effective SFS must have a strong foundation in the supervision of an individual financial institution, what some call “micro prudential supervision.” Implementation of SFS requires supervisory staff to maintain a strong grasp of the operational activities and the inherent risk profile of the financial institutions they supervise as well as the risk management systems these firms employ. Put another way, I think SFS has the best chance of meeting objectives if it becomes part and parcel of core supervisory operations; I have some concern about the value of SFS if it becomes an appendage to “routine” supervision carried out by macro prudential specialists.\nCarrying out early identification, for example, requires a detailed understanding of how large financial institutions conduct their business, strong grasp on the financial reporting/MIS of the financial institutions under review, clear and routine communication with their management, and sufficient supervisory experience to evaluate the data/information provided by the financial institution. Enhanced PCA will maintain a supervisory capital measure. This requires supervisory evaluation of a financial institution's capital position which necessitates reviews of asset quality and the allowance for loan losses, among other items. Even robust communication will benefit from integration with institution specific supervision.\nHeadwinds and the Economy\nLet me now move onto the second topic, namely the implications of the past year of financial turmoil for the economy. I suggested at the onset that a useful framework for thinking about this issue was the headwinds episode of the early 1990s. In that period, credit became expensive and, in some cases, unavailable, even for relatively high quality borrowers. These credit conditions restrained consumer spending and business investment, and as a consequence, the recovery from the recession of 1990-91 was initially quite subdued. Eventually, of course, the economy performed very well over much of the 1990s, despite a rather rocky start.\nI think that today's circumstances align, although not perfectly, with the experience of the early 1990s. There is no doubt that a variety of potential borrowers are finding funding more difficult and expensive to obtain. Moreover, while there was a significant contraction in residential construction activity in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the recent correction in this sector has been more severe, especially with the decline in housing values, and is continuing.\nIt is important to bear in mind, however, that many “initial conditions” prevailing prior to this financial shock were perceptibly better than in the early 1990s. Unemployment, interest rates, and inflation were all lower at the outset of the latest period of turmoil than in the previous headwinds episode. Equally important, the financial condition of both most banking and nonfinancial businesses was relatively healthier at the onset of recent problems.\nIn my judgment, the 1990s headwinds episode continues to provide a valuable reference point for thinking about economic prospects. For the near-term, I think that this framework suggests further declines in employment and likely softness in consumer spending, with a diminution of inflation, absent a resurgence in energy and other commodity prices.\nIt is worth recalling that the recession of 1990-91 was brief but not especially mild. Depending on how one reads the data, headwinds restrained the pace of the ensuing expansion of the early 1990s from 12 to 36 months. Something similar is certainly conceivable today. However, in considering these prospects, we should note that, despite early challenges, the 1990s turned out to be an excellent decade for the U.S. economy by almost all metrics. The underlying flexibility and resilience of the economy are intact, and these characteristics should ultimately prevail.\nConclusion\nLet me quickly wrap this up, before turning to your comments and questions. I have commented on two significant repercussions of the major financial shock which first struck the economy about 14 months ago. First, in view of what we have seen at some large financial institutions and in some funding markets, the need to address TBTF through a framework which reduces spillovers is critical, and we propose systemic focused supervision as a constructive first step in this process. Second, given the headwinds associated with the financial shock, the economy appears likely to be restrained until these conditions improve, and that will take some time.\n\nOver the past 14 months, many financial markets and large financial institutions have been buffeted by a severe financial shock, a shock unprecedented in my tenure as a Reserve Bank president. The disruptions intensified over the summer and persist to this day, despite considerable injections of liquidity on our part and other actions intended to ameliorate the situation.

            "content": "Introduction\nOver the past 14 months, many financial markets and large financial institutions have been buffeted by a severe financial shock, a shock unprecedented in my tenure as a Reserve Bank president. The disruptions intensified over the summer and persist to this day, despite considerable injections of liquidity on our part and other actions intended to ameliorate the situation. While I will not comment on specific proposals or their implementation, it is clear to me that a comprehensive program to unlock the credit markets is required.\nMaking progress against the turmoil at hand is certainly the top priority at this stage. But soon enough policymakers will want to identify fundamental reforms that reduce the likelihood that we will face another period of financial instability. In this spirit, in my comments this morning I want to consider the repercussions of these events from two distinct perspectives: first, I want to discuss their implications for regulatory, supervisory, and financial stability policies going forward; and, second, I want to consider their implications for the current and prospective economic environment.\nTo preview my major themes, I will suggest that the too-big-to-fail problem, with which I have long been concerned, has been exacerbated by actions taken over the past year to bolster financial stability. These actions were fully appropriate against the background of the risks at hand, and it is essential that they succeed, but going forward they will require policies to address spillovers and to reduce the likelihood of full protection of uninsured creditors of large, complex financial institutions. I will elaborate specific proposals in a few minutes, but let me emphasize one point: it is critical that we address TBTF because, if left unchecked, it could well be a major source of future instability.\nAs to economic prospects, I have been convinced for some time that financial conditions in the wake of the shock are reminiscent of, although certainly not identical to, those prevailing during the “headwinds” episode of the early 1990s. At the least, that experience provides a useful framework for analysis of the current state of the credit markets, the economy, and intermediate-term prospects. And before proceeding further, let me also remind you of the usual caveat: I am speaking only for myself and not for others in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Expanded Safety Net and Too-Big-To-Fail\nIn our Bank's 2007 annual report, I expressed concern about the expansion of the safety net for large financial firms and, particularly, its potential to dull the market forces that would otherwise serve to constrain excessive risk taking. Although the annual report essay was released just a few months ago, the financial safety net has expanded appreciably since then. The dimensions of the too-big-to-fail (TBTF) problem have increased once again.\nAt the same time, however, there has been progress in beginning to develop a policy framework to address TBTF and to enhance market discipline. Policymakers have begun to focus more explicitly on minimizing the fallout, or “spillovers,” from a financial firm's impairment as they consider how to improve financial stability and to reduce the incentives for excessive risk taking inherent in TBTF.\nNaturally, I view these latter developments positively. In 2004 I co-authored, with Ron Feldman, a book entitled Too Big to Fail, the Hazards of Bank Bailouts. In that work, we emphasized that “policymakers should give highest priority to reforms limiting the chance that one bank's failure will threaten the solvency of other banks.” We came to that conclusion using the following logic:\nPolicymakers provide financial support to weak but systemically important financial firms to contain spillovers;\nReducing the fallout from financial firm failures undermines the principal rationale for extraordinary government support;\nCreditor expectations of receiving government support will diminish (and market discipline will increase) as policymakers have less reason to provide such support.\nThis reasoning can contribute to agreement on a general policy framework to address TBTF, but such a framework is not a sufficient base for reform. Government agencies charged with addressing instability and related TBTF concerns, and private sector groups and firms critical to that effort, require specific recommendations. We have long had a list of specific reforms to address TBTF, but heretofore we have not prioritized those proposals. So of the many recommendations we made, where would we have policymakers start? We would begin the effort to manage TBTF with an approach we call systemic focused supervision (SFS).\nSystemic Focused Supervision\nIn general, SFS attempts to focus supervision and regulation efforts on spillover reduction, and it consists of three pillars: early identification, enhanced prompt corrective action (PCA), and stability-related communication. In particular, SFS uses the information-gathering and analytical skills of supervisors to better understand how one firm's impairment might spread to other firms or markets; it relies on the enforcement capabilities of regulation (combined with market information) to close firms before they incur losses that could bring down their peers; and it extends central bank communication techniques to financial-stability-related efforts.\nThis program builds on the strength and current direction of supervision and regulation to focus across firms and the interconnections in the banking and financial system as a whole, rather than concentrating on supervisory assessment of single firms. Combined, these efforts constitute important actions in a long-term effort to limit the spillovers from the failure or impairment of a systemically important financial institution. I'll now describe what I see as the basics of the three components.\nEarly Identification. This is a process to identify and to respond, where appropriate, to the material exposures between large financial institutions and between these institutions and capital markets. By material, we mean a sufficient exposure such that problems at one of these financial institutions could significantly impair other depository institutions and/or normal market functions.\nEarly identification could take many forms. Supervisors might begin by examining the performance of a number of large financial institutions subject to a series of shocks. The shocks could include large losses to a given type of loan or security on the firms' balance sheet, or a significant drop in the availability of funding. The results of this examination would provide policymakers with a sense of which stresses lead to significant problems at the firms. A second step is to determine how the material difficulties of one of these large institutions would affect the others. At a minimum, this would involve determining how much the failing institution owes the others at the end of the business day, what form the exposure takes, how much the exposure varies over time, and so on.\nThe goals of the exercise I just described (1) to give policymakers a sense of the type of events that are not likely to cause severe impairment, thus permitting them to avoid support and (2) to identify those exposures that might bring down the firm, and thus are deserving of closer policy scrutiny and response. As an essential part of this effort, supervisors should consider how they will make assessments of spillover potential at the time a financial institution experiences serious difficulty. Supervisors must determine what type of information they will need in short order from financial institutions during a period of turmoil, what information they can actually get, and develop a plan to address gaps that are identified. Closing these gaps means that policymakers can make informed judgments at the time of failure and, where possible, identify and resolve those issues that would otherwise lead to provision of extraordinary support.\nEnhanced Prompt Corrective Action. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 implemented PCA. Like many so-called “structured early intervention and resolution (SEIR)” regimes, PCA works by requiring supervisors to take prespecified actions against a bank as its capital falls below certain levels. A bank whose capital declines below a given level, for example, would have its ability to pay dividends constrained. In the extreme, chartering authorities will close banks whose capital levels fall below the lowest established trigger and who cannot raise additional capital.\nClosing banks while they still have positive capital, or at most a small loss, can reduce spillovers in a fairly direct way. If a bank's failure does not impose large losses, by definition it cannot directly threaten the viability of other DIs that have exposure to it. Thus, PCA is an important tool to manage systemic risk.\nHowever, many observers, including some of the most zealous advocates of using a SEIR regime in the United States, view PCA as inadequate because it relies, in great part, on the so-called book value of capital. This capital measure, particularly for bank loans, often reflects a “rearview mirror” or historical assessment of the bank's assets.Such assessments may, at times, prove excessively generous. Using PCA triggers based on more forward-looking measures of bank solvency could help address this shortcoming.\nData from financial markets offer one source of forward looking measures of a bank's condition; market participants do not always get their forecast right but they do appear to incorporate assessments of the future prospects of firms in their pricing decisions. This suggests that an enhanced PCA regime relying on both book value capital and market measures of risk—such as subordinated debt spreads, prices of credit default swaps, and/or equity values, among others—would enhance the current regime. In fact, the original proposals for SEIR in the U.S. used market measures of bank net worth to provoke supervisory action.In practice this could mean that some combination of market signals and accounting measures of insolvency could lead to the timely closure of a bank.\nIncorporating market signals into PCA certainly has potential downsides. Like other reforms that increase market discipline, enhanced PCA may force firms into resolution, and potentially into the sale of troubled assets, precisely when the financial system seems most vulnerable.This observation suggests the need to average market measures over time to smooth out short-run volatility, or to rely on peer comparisons, for example, so as to avoid overreaction. I would also note that enhanced PCA assumes a bank-like resolution regime, something that does not yet exist outside of the banking venue.\nCommunication. The first two pillars of SFS seek to increase market discipline by reducing the motivation of policymakers to protect uninsured creditors. But creditors will not know about efforts to limit spillovers, and will not change their expectations of support, absent explicit communication by policymakers about these activities. What form might that communication take?\nIn general, we have suggested that this communication possess several attributes. First, it should be released routinely, like the semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, so that interested parties can rely on it. Second, it should disclose information on stability related activity at an early stage, even if it is work in progress. Such a strategy would provide creditors with a richer sense of the changes underway. Finally, we think the communication should explicitly link the activity underway to the goal of reducing spillovers, thus raising the feasibility and prudence of putting creditors at greater risk of loss.\nIf we take a step back and reflect on these proposals, at the end of the day SFS is all about preparation—preparation from two distinct, but closely-related, perspectives.The underlying idea is, before severe problems arise, to identify potential vulnerabilities and spillovers, and to select market signals to enhance PCA. And, secondly, specific, regular communication is necessary to prepare creditors for the change in regime and to encourage changes in their expectations and behavior.\nThe general cross-institution focus of SFS has similarities to what is often called macro prudential supervision. But just as I view SFS as building on current trends in safety and soundness supervision, effective SFS must have a strong foundation in the supervision of an individual financial institution, what some call “micro prudential supervision.” Implementation of SFS requires supervisory staff to maintain a strong grasp of the operational activities and the inherent risk profile of the financial institutions they supervise as well as the risk management systems these firms employ. Put another way, I think SFS has the best chance of meeting objectives if it becomes part and parcel of core supervisory operations; I have some concern about the value of SFS if it becomes an appendage to “routine” supervision carried out by macro prudential specialists.\nCarrying out early identification, for example, requires a detailed understanding of how large financial institutions conduct their business, strong grasp on the financial reporting/MIS of the financial institutions under review, clear and routine communication with their management, and sufficient supervisory experience to evaluate the data/information provided by the financial institution. Enhanced PCA will maintain a supervisory capital measure. This requires supervisory evaluation of a financial institution's capital position which necessitates reviews of asset quality and the allowance for loan losses, among other items. Even robust communication will benefit from integration with institution specific supervision.\nHeadwinds and the Economy\nLet me now move onto the second topic, namely the implications of the past year of financial turmoil for the economy. I suggested at the onset that a useful framework for thinking about this issue was the headwinds episode of the early 1990s. In that period, credit became expensive and, in some cases, unavailable, even for relatively high quality borrowers. These credit conditions restrained consumer spending and business investment, and as a consequence, the recovery from the recession of 1990-91 was initially quite subdued. Eventually, of course, the economy performed very well over much of the 1990s, despite a rather rocky start.\nI think that today's circumstances align well, although certainly not perfectly, with the experience of the early 1990s. There is no doubt that a variety of potential borrowers are finding funding more difficult and expensive to obtain. Moreover, while there was a significant contraction in residential construction activity in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the recent correction in this sector has been more severe, especially with the decline in housing values, and is continuing.\nIt is important to bear in mind, however, that many “initial conditions” prevailing prior to this financial shock were perceptibly better than in the early 1990s. Unemployment, interest rates, and inflation were all lower at the outset of the latest period of turmoil than in the previous headwinds episode. Equally important, the financial condition of both most banking and nonfinancial businesses was relatively healthier at the onset of recent problems.\nIn my judgment, the 1990s headwinds episode continues to provide a valuable reference point for thinking about economic prospects. For the near-term, I think that this framework suggests further declines in employment and likely softness in consumer spending, with a diminution of inflation, absent a resurgence in energy and other commodity prices.\nIt is worth recalling that the recession of 1990-91 was brief but not especially mild. Depending on how one reads the data, headwinds restrained the pace of the ensuing expansion of the early 1990s for from 12 to 36 months. Something similar is certainly conceivable today. However, in considering these prospects, we should note that, despite early challenges, the 1990s turned out to be an excellent decade for the U.S. economy by almost all metrics. The underlying flexibility and resilience of the economy is intact, and these characteristics should ultimately prevail.\nConclusion\nLet me quickly wrap this up, before turning to your comments and questions.

In these remarks, I want to consider the repercussions of this shock from two distinct perspectives: first, I want to discuss their implications for regulatory, supervisory, and financial stability policies going forward; and, second, I want to examine their implications for the current and prospective economic environment. \nTo preview my major themes, I will suggest that the too-big-to-fail problem, with which I have long been concerned, has been exacerbated by actions taken over the past year to bolster financial stability.

At the least, that experience provides a useful framework for analysis of the current state of the economy and its intermediate-term prospects. And before proceeding further, let me also remind you of the usual caveat: I am speaking only for myself and not for others in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Expanded Safety Net and Too-Big-To-Fail\nIn our Bank’s 2007 Annual Report, I expressed concern about the recent expansion of the safety net for large financial firms and, particularly, its potential to dull the market forces that would otherwise constrain excessive risk taking. Although the Annual Report essay was released just a few months ago, the financial safety net has expanded since then, with the explicit increase in government support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The too-big-to-fail (TBTF) problem has once again gotten worse.\n\nAt the same time, however, there has been progress in beginning to develop a policy framework to address TBTF and to enhance market discipline. Policymakers have begun to focus more explicitly on minimizing the fallout, or “spillovers,” from a financial firm’s impairment as they consider how to improve financial stability and to reduce the incentives for excessive risk taking inherent in TBTF.\n\nNaturally, I view these latter developments quite positively. In our 2004 book on TBTF, Ron Feldman and I noted that “policymakers should give highest priority to reforms limiting the chance that one bank’s failure will threaten the solvency of other banks.” We came to that conclusion using the following logic: \nPolicymakers provide financial support to weak but systemically important financial firms to contain spillovers;\nReducing the fallout from financial firm failures undercuts the rationale for extraordinary government support;\nCreditor expectations of receiving government support will diminish (and market discipline will increase) when it is known that policymakers have less reason to provide such support.\nRecent comments from Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson echo this argument (and we have seen it elsewhere as well):\nIn an optimal system, market discipline effectively constrains risk because the regulatory structure is strong enough that a financial institution can fail without threatening the overall system. For market discipline to constrain risk effectively, financial institutions must be allowed to fail. Under optimal financial regulatory and financial system infrastructures, such a failure would not threaten the overall system.\nHowever, today two concerns underpin expectations of regulatory intervention to prevent a failure. They are that an institution may be too interconnected to fail or too big to fail. We must take steps to reduce the perception that this is so—and that requires that we reduce the likelihood that it is so.\nHaving agreement on a general policy framework is a necessary but not sufficient base for reform. Government agencies charged with addressing instability and related TBTF concerns, and private sector groups and firms critical to that effort, require specific recommendations. Those implementing reforms should have a sense for prioritization; after all, we face a world of limited resources and so must pick and choose if we aspire for effectiveness in implementation.\n\nWe have long had a list of specific reforms to address TBTF, but we have not prioritized those proposals. So of the many recommendations we made, where would we have policymakers start? We would begin the effort to manage TBTF with an approach we call systemic focused supervision (SFS).\nSystemic Focused Supervision\nI earlier described SFS in general as an effort to apply a focus on spillover reduction to supervision, regulation, and communication as well, but let me now detail its three pillars: they are stress testing; enhanced prompt corrective action (PCA); and stability-related communication. Combined, these efforts offer important actions in a long-term effort to limit the spillovers from the failure or impairment of a systemically important financial institution. I now describe the basics of each of the three components.\n\nStress Tests.  In this context, this is a process to identify and respond to the material exposures between large financial institutions and between these institutions and capital markets. By material, we mean a sufficiently significant exposure such that problems at one of these financial institutions could significantly impair other depository institutions and/or normal market functions.\n\nThis process could take many forms. Supervisors might begin by examining the performance of a small number of large financial institutions under a series of stress tests. The tests could include large losses to a given type of loan or security on the firms’ balance sheets, or a significant drop in the availability of funding. The results would provide policymakers with a sense of which stresses lead to significant problems at the firms. The next step is to determine how the difficulties of one of these large institutions would affect the others.  At a minimum, this would involve determining how much the failing institution owes the others at the end of the day, what form the exposure takes, how much the exposure varies over time, and so on.\n\nThe goals of the exercise I just described are (1) to give policymakers a sense of the type of events that are not likely to bring down the financial institution, thus permitting them to avoid support and (2) to identify those exposures that might bring down the firm, and thus are deserving of closer policy scrutiny and response. As part of this effort, supervisors should also consider how they will make assessments of spillover potential at the time a financial institution experiences serious difficulty. Supervisors must determine what type of information they will need in short order from financial institutions during a period of turmoil, what information they can actually get in short order, and develop a plan to address whatever gaps are identified. Closing these gaps means that policymakers can make informed judgments at the time of failure and, where possible, identify and resolve those issues that would otherwise lead them to provide extraordinary support.\n\nEnhanced Prompt Corrective Action (PCA). The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 implemented PCA.  Like many so-called “structured early intervention and resolution (SEIR)” regimes, PCA works by requiring supervisors to take prespecified actions against a bank as its capital falls below specified levels. A bank whose capital declines below a given level, for example, would have its ability to pay dividends constrained. In the extreme, chartering authorities will shut banks whose capital levels fall below the lowest established trigger and who cannot raise additional capital.   \n\nClosing banks while they still have positive capital, or at least a small loss, can reduce spillovers in a fairly direct way. If a bank’s failure does not impose large losses, by definition it cannot directly threaten the viability of other depository institutions that have exposure to it. Thus, the PCA regime offers an important tool to manage systemic risk.\n\nHowever, many observers, including some of the most zealous advocates of using a SEIR regime in the United States, view PCA as inadequate because it relies, in great part, on the so-called book value of capital.  This capital measure, particularly for bank loans, often reflects a “rear-view window” or historical assessment of the bank’s assets.  Under this measure, a bank that appears to have positive capital can actually have large losses upon failure.  Using PCA triggers based on more forward-looking measures of bank solvency could help address this concern.\n\nData from financial markets offers one source of forward-looking measures of a bank’s condition; market participants do not always get their forecast right, but they do appear to incorporate assessments of the future prospects of firms in their pricing decisions. This suggests that an enhanced PCA regime relying on both book-value capital and market measures of risk—such as subordinated debt spreads, prices of credit-default swaps, and/or equity values, among others—would be an improvement over the current regime. In fact, the original proposals for SEIR in the U.S. used market measures of bank net worth to provoke supervisory action.  In practice, this could mean that some combination of market signals and accounting measures of insolvency could lead to the closure of a bank.\n\nIn addition to being forward-looking, market measures of bank risk have an advantage in that supervisors do not determine them.  In cases where supervisors might prefer to forebear (i.e., not take appropriate remedial action against a financial institution as its condition worsens), book-value measures may provide some justification.  In contrast, market measures are not subject to this shortcoming.\n\nCommunication. The first two pillars of SFS seek to increase market discipline by reducing the stability-related motivations policymakers have for protecting creditors. But creditors will not know about efforts to limit spillovers, and will not change their expectations of support, absent explicit communication about spillover-reducing activities. What form might this communication take? \n\nIn general, we have suggested that this communication have three attributes. First, it should be released routinely, like the semi-annual “Humphrey-Hawkins” testimony, to facilitate the ability of interested parties to focus. Second, it should disclose information on stability-related activity at an early stage, even if it is work in progress. Such a strategy would provide creditors with a richer sense of the activity under way. Finally, we think the communication should explicitly link the activity under way to the goal of reducing spillovers, thus raising the feasibility and prudence of putting creditors at greater risk of loss.\nHeadwinds and the Economy\nLet me now move on briefly to the second topic of these remarks, namely the implications of the past year of financial turmoil for the economy. I suggested at the outset that a useful framework for thinking about this issue was the headwinds episode of the early 1990s.  In that period, credit became expensive and, in some cases, unavailable, even for relatively high-quality borrowers.  These credit conditions restrained consumer spending and business investment and, as a consequence, the recovery from the recession of 1990-91 was initially quite subdued. Eventually, of course, the economy performed very well over much of the 1990s, despite a rather rocky start.\n\nI think that today’s circumstances align well, although certainly not perfectly, with the experience of the early 1990s. There is no doubt that a variety of potential borrowers are finding funding more difficult and expensive to obtain. Moreover, while there was a significant contraction in residential construction activity in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the recent correction in this sector has been more severe, especially with the decline in housing values, and is continuing. The appreciable run-up, net, in energy and other commodity prices has taken a toll on consumer discretionary spending as well.\nIt is important to bear in mind, however, that many “initial conditions” prevailing prior to this financial shock were perceptibly better than in the early 1990s. Unemployment, interest rates, and inflation were all lower at the outset of the latest period of turmoil than in the previous headwinds episode. Equally important, the financial condition of both banking and nonfinancial businesses was healthier at the onset of recent problems.\n\nOverall, while there is considerable uncertainty about the outlook and while the policy environment is challenging to say the least, my view is that the early 1990s headwinds episode remains a valuable guide at this juncture. Specifically, it would imply a continuation of only modest expansion in the economy, the likelihood of further increases in unemployment for a time, and a diminution of inflation, absent a resurgence in energy and other commodity prices.\n\nIn considering these prospects, it is worth recalling that, despite early challenges, the 1990s turned out to be an excellent decade for the U.S. economy by almost all metrics. The economy is fundamentally flexible and resilient, and these characteristics should ultimately prevail.\nConclusion\nLet me quickly wrap this up, before turning to your comments and questions. I have commented this afternoon on two significant repercussions of the major financial shock which first struck the economy about one year ago. First, in view of what we have seen at some large financial institutions and in some funding markets, the need to address TBTF through a framework which reduces spillovers is critical, and we propose systemic-focused supervision as a constructive first step in this process. Second, given the headwinds associated with the financial shock, the economy appears likely to be restrained until credit conditions improve, as they inevitably will.\n\nOver the past year, many financial markets and large banking institutions have been buffeted by a severe financial shock, the effects of which persist to this day. In these remarks, I want to consider the repercussions of this shock from two distinct perspectives: first, I want to discuss their implications for regulatory, supervisory, and financial stability policies going forward; and, second, I want to examine their implications for the current and prospective economic environment.\n\nTo preview my major themes, I will suggest that the too-big-to-fail problem, with which I have long been concerned, has been exacerbated by actions taken over the past year to bolster financial stability. These actions were appropriate against the background of the risks at hand, but they also call for “systemic focused supervision” going forward to address spillovers and to reduce the likelihood of full protection of uninsured creditors of large, complex financial institutions. I will elaborate specific proposals in a few minutes.  As to economic prospects, I have been convinced for some time that financial conditions in the wake of the shock are reminiscent of those prevailing during the “headwinds” episode of the early 1990s. At the least, that experience provides a useful framework for analysis of the current state of the economy and its intermediate-term prospects. And before proceeding further, let me also remind you of the usual caveat: I am speaking only for myself and not for others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIn our Bank’s 2007 Annual Report, I expressed concern about the recent expansion of the safety net for large financial firms and, particularly, its potential to dull the market forces that would otherwise constrain excessive risk taking. Although the Annual Report essay was released just a few months ago, the financial safety net has expanded since then, with the explicit increase in government support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The too-big-to-fail (TBTF) problem has once again gotten worse.\n\nAt the same time, however, there has been progress in beginning to develop a policy framework to address TBTF and to enhance market discipline. Policymakers have begun to focus more explicitly on minimizing the fallout, or “spillovers,” from a financial firm’s impairment as they consider how to improve financial stability and to reduce the incentives for excessive risk taking inherent in TBTF.\n\nNaturally, I view these latter developments quite positively.

            "content": "Introduction\nGood afternoon. It is a distinct pleasure to join you here in London at the European Economics and Financial Centre, and to have the opportunity to discuss several issues of significance in macroeconomic policy. Among the principal challenges we central bankers face is constructing an effective short-run response to shocks to the economy which simultaneously is consonant with our long-run objectives. Make no mistake, we take our responsibility for financial stability seriously and attempt to ensure, insofar as possible, that periods of instability are few and far between. When financial conditions become unstable, we respond in order to contain the consequences for the real economy. Historical perspective and precedents can help sort through these demands; after all, while history does not repeat itself exactly, we shouldn't conclude that it isn't of value.\nToo Big To Fail\nBefore reviewing this history in greater depth and examining its implications for the present, let me remind you that I am speaking here only for myself and not for others on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve. In this vein, and before I discuss macroeconomic policy more generally, I want to briefly provide some thoughts on issues related to the so-called too-big-to-fail (TBTF) problem. As you may know, I have long considered this an issue of particular importance and relevance given the growth of large banks, their increasing complexity, and the history of government support for such institutions when they get into trouble. Indeed, I have gone so far as to co-author a  book on the topic, in 2004, and I think the message and recommendations of the book hold up well against the background of recent events. I see ample opportunity for application of our analyses and recommendations to the current debate as policymakers consider long-run responses and lessons learned from current problems.\nThe message of the book is straightforward. While governments cannot and should not uniformly avoid public support for creditors of failing banks, they should seek to minimize that support because of the distortions it produces. Such public support—even when it passes a benefit-cost test at the time of provision—encourages future risk-taking by institutions whose creditors expect to benefit from future support. Such risk-taking can even contribute to the specific financial conditions that prompt further government support. The key to addressing these costs is, when times are good, to act to reduce creditors' expectations of receiving protection.\nAs we detail in the book, managing expectations of protection requires that policymakers take steps before a crisis to make it less likely that the failure of large or important financial institutions \"spills over\" to other institutions, markets, and the rest of the economy. Policymakers should also undertake steps to better understand the potential for spillovers before large institutions get in trouble, as this would allow them to target any support they provide, or perhaps make it more likely that support could be avoided. Because I believe spillovers drive the provision of after-the-fact government support, I am not convinced that other approaches are as likely to alter creditors' expectations.\nLet me provide just one example of the type of actions policymakers can take before a crisis. In the book we call for the relevant regulatory agencies to simulate the failure of a large financial institution with a particular focus on those aspects of the failure that would produce spillovers. The information gathered from such an exercise would help set the agenda for reforms that agencies could pursue to limit the type of events that would end up justifying government support.\nA final TBTF comment: Recent events have likely reaffirmed and strengthened some creditors' expectations of support, or have created those expectations for the first time. I think one would be hard pressed to dismiss our analyses or proposals by claiming that such expectations do not exist. On the opposite end of the spectrum, some might dismiss our suggestions, arguing that we cannot influence creditors' expectations. I reject that view as equally untenable. We simply cannot allow widespread perceptions of government support to pervade the financial system. Experience in other countries suggests that such a strategy is quite costly. And, in any case, our proposals seek to reduce systemic risk, an outcome presumably shared by policymakers regardless of their views on TBTF per se.\nFinancial Shock\nEven as the economic expansion continued for its sixth consecutive year in 2007, it became clear that problems in housing and in subprime (adjustable-rate) mortgages had been building for quite some time and had, in fact, become severe. While no doubt there were lots of reasons for these difficulties (including instances of fraud, predatory lending, faulty credit agency ratings, and inadequate risk management practices at financial institutions), one principal source was expectations of ever-rising home prices. Many transactions would have worked out satisfactorily if only housing prices had continued to rise rapidly. Also, to add perspective, even with heightened delinquencies and foreclosures, the preponderance of subprime borrowers are still in their homes today, making timely payments, and so presumably are better off than they otherwise would have been.\nSince late last summer, economic events have been largely overshadowed by developments in financial and credit markets in the U.S. I will not recite the litany of what has transpired, assuming that it is generally familiar to many of you, except where it is pertinent to describing the outlook and assessing the issues before us.\nSuffice it to say that for a time many financial markets were seriously impaired and, although conditions in some have shown signs of improvement more recently, other markets remain dysfunctional. There has been an appreciable amount of turmoil and turbulence. Further, many large banks, both in the U.S. and abroad, have found that their balance sheets have expanded measurably as holdings increased of nonconforming mortgages, leveraged loans, and other credits that they had extended but for which well-functioning secondary markets no longer exist. Moreover, banks that had acted as sponsors of structured credit products and special-purpose investment vehicles came under pressure to take the assets of the off-balance-sheet entities onto their own books. And as this was happening, some banks began to report large losses, so the combination of larger-than-anticipated balance sheets and unexpected losses has prompted banks to hoard liquidity and balance-sheet capacity and thus to become less willing to provide funding to others.\nThese are consequential developments in my judgment, as is the failure of Bear Stearns, the fifth-largest investment bank in the U.S., but while significant to economic developments, these circumstances are not completely unfamiliar. A brief review of history can help frame our short- and longer-term objectives and implementation approaches in the current period.\nHeadwinds\nThe situation we confront today is reminiscent, in several salient ways, of the headwinds environment that prevailed in the aftermath of the 1990-91 recession. In this regard, the 1994 \"Economic Report of the President\" devoted part of a chapter to those headwinds and provides a convenient jumping-off point to examine similarities. According to the 1994 Report, the headwinds that restrained the economy in the early 1990s consisted of: reductions in spending on national defense, weak foreign economies, a debt overhang, excesses in commercial construction, corporate restructuring, and a credit crunch. Several of these conditions are not pertinent today, and so I would dismiss parallels in defense spending, foreign economies, and restructuring.\nHowever, while excesses in commercial construction have been avoided for the most part during the current expansion, the same cannot be said, of course, of residential construction, where the unsold, unoccupied inventory of houses and condominiums is large and where adjustment is still in train. Further, trends in commercial real estate finance and loan performance are starting to suggest softness in the underlying income-producing capability of some properties. And while I think the term \"debt overhang\" is overly broad, a significant number of homeowners are experiencing considerable strain in meeting their monthly obligations. Finally, in view of my earlier comments about impaired markets and institutions, the possibility of a credit crunch, and its attendant effects on economic performance, cannot be ruled out, and this is indeed a central focus of concern.\nTo my knowledge, there is not a precise definition of a credit crunch, but I would describe it as an environment in which quality borrowers find credit either unavailable or available only on very expensive terms. To the extent that such a situation develops, some investment projects and planned spending will be deferred or delayed for a time because of the difficulty of obtaining financing, resulting in more modest economic growth than would otherwise occur. While the data are not entirely unambiguous, it appears that the headwinds associated with credit conditions limited the pace of the economic expansion in the early 1990s for a period of from one to nearly three years, so the effects were important.\nOutlook\nThe potential for headwinds is integral to thinking about U.S. economic prospects over the next year or two. To the extent that headwinds gain momentum, they suggest relatively modest growth for a time and the likelihood of increases in the unemployment rate. Their implications for inflation are not so clear, although I would note that the pace of inflation diminished in the early 1990s relative to its performance over the preceding several years. And this diminution in inflation occurred despite a significant reduction in the Federal funds rate, from about 9 ¾ percent in early 1989 to 3 percent in September 1992, where it stayed until early 1994.\nAs you know, the Federal Reserve has acted decisively in recent months to address both illiquidity in financial markets and the deterioration in the economic outlook. To be specific:\nInitially, the gap between the discount rate (the rate on the primary credit facility) and Federal funds rate target was reduced from 100 to 50 basis points to make discount window credit more attractive to banks; this spread was subsequently reduced by another 25 basis points.\n\nA Term Auction Facility (TAF) was initiated in December, to make 28-day term credit available to banks against a variety of collateral. This was done to add liquidity and to unlock short-term markets that had frozen up. This action was coordinated internationally to assist dollar funding markets abroad as well.\n\nIn March, both a Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) and a Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) were introduced to enhance liquidity and foster the functioning of financial markets.\n\nThe target for the Federal funds rate is now 2 ¼ percent, down from 5 ¼ percent as recently as September.\nAgainst the background of the financial shocks that have beset the markets and the economy and their implications for the outlook, these actions, including the reduction in the funds rate target, appear wholly appropriate. The Federal Reserve has a responsibility, insofar as possible, to restore financial stability and to protect the real economy from collateral damage stemming from instability. On numerous previous occasions, I have extolled the underlying resilience of the economy, but I have also pointed out that resilience is in some sense \"endogenous;\" that is, it has resulted in part as a consequence of well-functioning financial markets and appropriate policy responses to emerging problems.\nTo this point, I have for the most part emphasized the similarities between current circumstances and the headwinds environment of the early 1990s. But there are some important distinctions as well. Inflation and inflation expectations are lower today than they were in the late 1980s-early 1990s, as is the rate of unemployment. Similarly, nominal and real interest rates are lower now. Compared to the earlier episode, the balance sheets of nonfinancial corporations are stronger and healthier today on average, as is the financial condition of most depository institutions. On the other hand, while there was a prolonged contraction in residential construction in the latter part of the 1980s which extended into 1991, the current downturn in housing appears to be more severe, as is the intensity of the illiquidity engulfing financial markets and the scope of decline in housing values. Some of these differences serve to mitigate concerns about the outlook, but others exacerbate them; to state the obvious, there is a great amount of uncertainty.\nWe in the Federal Reserve are fully aware of the \"time inconsistency\" problem and recognize that we have to take care that the policies we have pursued to date do not compromise achievement of our dual mandate and, in particular, our objective of sustained low inflation. Inflation expectations have remained reasonably well anchored so far, which is encouraging. But the key to maintaining low inflation and inflation expectations is likely to be the timeliness and magnitude of decisions we make to reverse course. We are highly sensitive to this issue, and I am confident that we will conduct policy in an appropriate and timely manner.\nAsset Prices\nThere is one additional issue I would like to consider briefly, having to do with policy and asset prices, before concluding these remarks, because it follows directly from some of the issues we currently confront, especially those dealing with TBTF and systemic risk. Here is another example of how history, however recent, can inform our understanding of current events. While I have not yet changed my opinion that asset-price levels should not be an objective of monetary policy, I am reviewing this conclusion in the wake of the fallout from the decline in house prices and from the earlier collapse of prices of technology stocks. To be sure, it is challenging at best to identify when asset prices have reached excessive levels, to build support for action once identification has occurred, and to implement corrective policy successfully. These are all significant obstacles, and thus it may well be that containing damage as and after prices correct is, in the end, the preferable alternative.\nHowever, I think it is important to consider these conclusions in light of recent events, where it has proven to be neither easy nor costless to deal with the aftermath of unsustainably high asset prices. I won't try your patience this afternoon by going into this topic in depth; let me just say at this point that I suspect that there may be practical, albeit far from infallible, ways to identify excesses in asset prices. Moreover, it is well within the realm of possibility for policymakers to build support for, and at least obtain tolerance of, policies designed to address excesses. It is not clear, however, that such policies would necessarily pass a cost-benefit test, for actions to limit or reduce asset prices quite likely would have implications for economywide growth and employment. But then, so, of course, do asset-price collapses, and thus this is a juncture, likely one among several, where careful thought and rigorous analysis have to be brought to bear. This is a task for another day, however.\nConclusion\nSo let me conclude. I think the Federal Reserve has taken appropriate policy steps to respond to a significant financial shock, a shock which has rendered some markets illiquid and which has affected the economic outlook negatively. This shock may well produce parallels to the headwinds episode of the early 1990s. In this environment, policy needs to remain sensitive to evolving financial conditions and to incoming information on business activity in order to further determine the relevance of that earlier experience. And the aftermath of that episode may also prove relevant, in that the 1990s, taken as a whole, illustrate the underlying resilience of the American economy and the value of policy adherence to the dual mandate.\nThank you for your attention.\n\nGood afternoon. It is a distinct pleasure to join you here in London at the European Economics and Financial Centre, and to have the opportunity to discuss several issues of significance in macroeconomic policy.

I think one would be hard pressed to dismiss our analyses or proposals by claiming that such expectations do not exist. On the opposite end of the spectrum, some might dismiss our suggestions, arguing that we cannot influence creditors' expectations. I reject that view as equally untenable. We simply cannot allow widespread perceptions of government support to pervade the financial system. Experience in other countries suggests that such a strategy is quite costly. And, in any case, our proposals seek to reduce systemic risk, an outcome presumably shared by policymakers regardless of their views on TBTF per se.\n\nEven as the economic expansion continued for its sixth consecutive year in 2007, it became clear that problems in housing and in subprime (adjustable-rate) mortgages had been building for quite some time and had, in fact, become severe. While no doubt there were lots of reasons for these difficulties (including instances of fraud, predatory lending, faulty credit agency ratings, and inadequate risk management practices at financial institutions), one principal source was expectations of ever-rising home prices. Many transactions would have worked out satisfactorily if only housing prices had continued to rise rapidly. Also, to add perspective, even with heightened delinquencies and foreclosures, the preponderance of subprime borrowers are still in their homes today, making timely payments, and so presumably are better off than they otherwise would have been.\n\nSince late last summer, economic events have been largely overshadowed by developments in financial and credit markets in the U.S. I will not recite the litany of what has transpired, assuming that it is generally familiar to many of you, except where it is pertinent to describing the outlook and assessing the issues before us.\n\nSuffice it to say that for a time many financial markets were seriously impaired and, although conditions in some have shown signs of improvement more recently, other markets remain dysfunctional. There has been an appreciable amount of turmoil and turbulence. Further, many large banks, both in the U.S. and abroad, have found that their balance sheets have expanded measurably as holdings increased of nonconforming mortgages, leveraged loans, and other credits that they had extended but for which well-functioning secondary markets no longer exist. Moreover, banks that had acted as sponsors of structured credit products and special-purpose investment vehicles came under pressure to take the assets of the off-balance-sheet entities onto their own books. And as this was happening, some banks began to report large losses, so the combination of larger-than-anticipated balance sheets and unexpected losses has prompted banks to hoard liquidity and balance-sheet capacity and thus to become less willing to provide funding to others.\n\nThese are consequential developments in my judgment, as is the failure of Bear Stearns, the fifth-largest investment bank in the U.S., but while significant to economic developments, these circumstances are not completely unfamiliar. A brief review of history can help frame our short- and longer-term objectives and implementation approaches in the current period.\n\nThe situation we confront today is reminiscent, in several salient ways, of the headwinds environment that prevailed in the aftermath of the 1990-91 recession. In this regard, the 1994 \"Economic Report of the President\" devoted part of a chapter to those headwinds and provides a convenient jumping-off point to examine similarities. According to the 1994 Report, the headwinds that restrained the economy in the early 1990s consisted of: reductions in spending on national defense, weak foreign economies, a debt overhang, excesses in commercial construction, corporate restructuring, and a credit crunch. Several of these conditions are not pertinent today, and so I would dismiss parallels in defense spending, foreign economies, and restructuring.\n\nHowever, while excesses in commercial construction have been avoided for the most part during the current expansion, the same cannot be said, of course, of residential construction, where the unsold, unoccupied inventory of houses and condominiums is large and where adjustment is still in train. Further, trends in commercial real estate finance and loan performance are starting to suggest softness in the underlying income-producing capability of some properties. And while I think the term \"debt overhang\" is overly broad, a significant number of homeowners are experiencing considerable strain in meeting their monthly obligations. Finally, in view of my earlier comments about impaired markets and institutions, the possibility of a credit crunch, and its attendant effects on economic performance, cannot be ruled out, and this is indeed a central focus of concern.\n\nTo my knowledge, there is not a precise definition of a credit crunch, but I would describe it as an environment in which quality borrowers find credit either unavailable or available only on very expensive terms. To the extent that such a situation develops, some investment projects and planned spending will be deferred or delayed for a time because of the difficulty of obtaining financing, resulting in more modest economic growth than would otherwise occur. While the data are not entirely unambiguous, it appears that the headwinds associated with credit conditions limited the pace of the economic expansion in the early 1990s for a period of from one to nearly three years, so the effects were important.\n\nThe potential for headwinds is integral to thinking about U.S. economic prospects over the next year or two. To the extent that headwinds gain momentum, they suggest relatively modest growth for a time and the likelihood of increases in the unemployment rate. Their implications for inflation are not so clear, although I would note that the pace of inflation diminished in the early 1990s relative to its performance over the preceding several years. And this diminution in inflation occurred despite a significant reduction in the Federal funds rate, from about 9 ¾ percent in early 1989 to 3 percent in September 1992, where it stayed until early 1994.\n\nAs you know, the Federal Reserve has acted decisively in recent months to address both illiquidity in financial markets and the deterioration in the economic outlook. To be specific:\n\nAgainst the background of the financial shocks that have beset the markets and the economy and their implications for the outlook, these actions, including the reduction in the funds rate target, appear wholly appropriate. The Federal Reserve has a responsibility, insofar as possible, to restore financial stability and to protect the real economy from collateral damage stemming from instability. On numerous previous occasions, I have extolled the underlying resilience of the economy, but I have also pointed out that resilience is in some sense \"endogenous;\" that is, it has resulted in part as a consequence of well-functioning financial markets and appropriate policy responses to emerging problems.\n\nTo this point, I have for the most part emphasized the similarities between current circumstances and the headwinds environment of the early 1990s. But there are some important distinctions as well. Inflation and inflation expectations are lower today than they were in the late 1980s-early 1990s, as is the rate of unemployment. Similarly, nominal and real interest rates are lower now. Compared to the earlier episode, the balance sheets of nonfinancial corporations are stronger and healthier today on average, as is the financial condition of most depository institutions. On the other hand, while there was a prolonged contraction in residential construction in the latter part of the 1980s which extended into 1991, the current downturn in housing appears to be more severe, as is the intensity of the illiquidity engulfing financial markets and the scope of decline in housing values. Some of these differences serve to mitigate concerns about the outlook, but others exacerbate them; to state the obvious, there is a great amount of uncertainty.\n\nWe in the Federal Reserve are fully aware of the \"time inconsistency\" problem and recognize that we have to take care that the policies we have pursued to date do not compromise achievement of our dual mandate and, in particular, our objective of sustained low inflation. Inflation expectations have remained reasonably well anchored so far, which is encouraging. But the key to maintaining low inflation and inflation expectations is likely to be the timeliness and magnitude of decisions we make to reverse course. We are highly sensitive to this issue, and I am confident that we will conduct policy in an appropriate and timely manner.\n\nThere is one additional issue I would like to consider briefly, having to do with policy and asset prices, before concluding these remarks, because it follows directly from some of the issues we currently confront, especially those dealing with TBTF and systemic risk. Here is another example of how history, however recent, can inform our understanding of current events. While I have not yet changed my opinion that asset-price levels should not be an objective of monetary policy, I am reviewing this conclusion in the wake of the fallout from the decline in house prices and from the earlier collapse of prices of technology stocks. To be sure, it is challenging at best to identify when asset prices have reached excessive levels, to build support for action once identification has occurred, and to implement corrective policy successfully. These are all significant obstacles, and thus it may well be that containing damage as and after prices correct is, in the end, the preferable alternative.\n\nHowever, I think it is important to consider these conclusions in light of recent events, where it has proven to be neither easy nor costless to deal with the aftermath of unsustainably high asset prices. I won't try your patience this afternoon by going into this topic in depth; let me just say at this point that I suspect that there may be practical, albeit far from infallible, ways to identify excesses in asset prices. Moreover, it is well within the realm of possibility for policymakers to build support for, and at least obtain tolerance of, policies designed to address excesses. It is not clear, however, that such policies would necessarily pass a cost-benefit test, for actions to limit or reduce asset prices quite likely would have implications for economywide growth and employment. But then, so, of course, do asset-price collapses, and thus this is a juncture, likely one among several, where careful thought and rigorous analysis have to be brought to bear. This is a task for another day, however.\n\nSo let me conclude. I think the Federal Reserve has taken appropriate policy steps to respond to a significant financial shock, a shock which has rendered some markets illiquid and which has affected the economic outlook negatively. This shock may well produce parallels to the headwinds episode of the early 1990s. In this environment, policy needs to remain sensitive to evolving financial conditions and to incoming information on business activity in order to further determine the relevance of that earlier experience. And the aftermath of that episode may also prove relevant, in that the 1990s, taken as a whole, illustrate the underlying resilience of the American economy and the value of policy adherence to the dual mandate.\n\nThank you for your attention."

I am pleased to be back with the Financial Planning Association again this year, and to have the opportunity to discuss several issues of significance in macroeconomic policy. These are challenging times and therefore represent an appropriate opportunity to take stock of where we are and the issues we confront. Given that time is limited, I will launch into substance momentarily, but let me first remind you that I am speaking only for myself and not for others on the FOMC or in the Federal Reserve.\nWe central bankers face a key challenge in constructing an effective response to short-run shocks, which remains consonant with our long-run goals. We take our responsibility for financial stability seriously, and we attempt to ensure that the consequences for the economy of periods of instability are contained. History has a role to play in sorting through these demands; after all, while history does not repeat itself exactly, that doesn't imply that we should ignore it. An experience potentially relevant to current circumstances is the \"headwinds\" episode of the early 1990s. In particular, it is possible that an appreciable tightening of credit conditions will, as then, restrain the economy for a time. This is the immediate problem but in the historical context we should bear in mind that, after a slow start and with appropriate policy, the 1990s became a decade of growth, of sustained gains in employment, and of diminishing inflation.\nBefore reviewing this history in greater depth, I will provide, as is typical on these occasions, a review of the recent performance of the economy in order to establish a foundation for consideration of our economic prospects. 2007 marked the sixth consecutive year of the current economic expansion. Given the duration of the two previous periods of growth–that is, the expansions of 1982-90 and 1991-2000—this is not an especially remarkable performance, but one that is welcome nevertheless.\nTo be sure, since late summer economic events have been largely overshadowed by developments in financial and credit markets. I will not recite the litany of what has transpired, assuming that it is generally familiar to many of you, except where it is pertinent to describing the outlook and assessing the issues before us. Suffice it to say that for a time many financial markets were seriously impaired and, although conditions in some have shown signs of improvement more recently, other markets remain dysfunctional. Moreover, many large banks, both here and abroad, have found it desirable to protect balance sheet capacity in the wake of unanticipated asset expansion and material financial losses in some cases as well.\nThese are important events in my judgment, with potentially significant implications for the economy for the next year or two, but they are not completely unfamiliar. A brief review of history can help frame our short-term and longer-term objectives and implementation approaches in the current period. The situation we confront today is reminiscent, in several salient ways, of the headwinds environment that prevailed in the aftermath of the 1990-91 recession.

According to the 1994 Report, the headwinds that restrained the economy in the early 1990s consisted of: reductions in spending on national defense, weak foreign economies, a debt overhang, excesses in commercial construction, corporate downsizing, and a credit crunch. Several of these conditions are not pertinent today, and so I would dismiss parallels in defense spending, foreign economies, and downsizing.\nHowever, while excesses in commercial construction have been avoided for the most part during the current expansion, the same cannot be said, of course, of residential construction, where the unsold, unoccupied inventory of houses and condominiums is large and where a major adjustment is still in train.

To the extent that such a situation develops, its economic impact is that some investment projects and planned spending will be deferred or delayed for a time because of the difficulty of obtaining financing, resulting in more modest economic growth than would otherwise occur.\nThese issues are clearly weighing on policy. While such an environment will not be permanent, it could well persist for an extended period because, if credit is in fact restricted by some institutions and in some markets, it will likely take time for potential borrowers to find alternatives and substitutes.\nThe potential for headwinds is integral to thinking about economic prospects over the next year or two. To the extent that these headwinds gain momentum, they suggest relatively modest growth for a time and the likelihood of increases in the unemployment rate. Their implications for inflation are not so clear, although I would note that the pace of inflation diminished in the early 1990s relative to its performance over the preceding several years.\nAs you know, Federal Reserve monetary policy has moved decisively in recent months, and the target for the Federal funds rate is now 3 percent, down from 5 ¼ percent as recently as September. Against the background of the financial shocks that have beset the economy and their implications for the outlook, the reduction in the funds rate target appears wholly appropriate. The Federal Reserve has a responsibility, insofar as possible, to restore financial stability and protect the real economy from collateral damage, and policy is now better positioned to attain these objectives than formerly. On numerous previous occasions, I have extolled the underlying resilience of the economy, but I have also pointed out that resilience is in some sense \"endogenous;\" that is, it has resulted in part as a consequence of well-functioning financial markets and appropriate policy responses to emerging problems.\nBut our responses to short-run disturbances need not lead to compromise of long-run objectives. Let me shift now to longer-term considerations and prospects for the economy. I have already suggested that headwinds will not last forever. As they diminish, the economy's performance will essentially be determined by the factors that shape the long term, namely, gains in productivity and growth of the labor force or, to be a bit more precise, of hours worked. On the productivity score, there is reason for continued optimism in view of the reacceleration last year and sustained healthy increases overall since the mid 1990s. For the labor force and hours, a number of matters come into play. The labor force is projected to grow modestly in the years ahead, reflecting relatively slow expansion of the working-age population as members of the baby boom generation begin to retire and as female labor force participation rates level off. This, by the way, will translate into the monthly employment statistics, so we might expect to see relatively small increments in employment in these data.\nBut the story is more complicated.  The decision to participate in the labor force and at what level presumably depends on things like compensation broadly defined, tax rates, public policies toward child care and education, and so on.  In short, the labor force, or hours worked for that matter, is not determined exclusively by demographics, to say nothing about the possible effects of changes in immigration.  Still, without putting too fine a point on it, I would expect economic growth in the long run to average somewhere around 2 ½ percent per year, given my expectations for productivity and for hours.  Such a performance is likely to exceed the pace of population increase, implying a further rise in standards of living over time\nThere is another element critical to this long-run projection, namely, that we in the Federal Reserve remain committed to achieving of our dual mandate of low inflation and maximum employment. Given the consensus that in the long run price stability represents the most significant contribution monetary policy can make to attaining high employment, it is essential that we conduct policy with this objective in mind, and I have no doubt that we will.\nWell before I began preparation for this meeting, I was asked by a member of the Financial Planning Association to discuss another form of the \"debt overhang,\" namely, estimates of the \"shortfalls\" in Social Security and Medicare—that is, the extent to which the social insurance programs are out of balance under current financing arrangements relative to scheduled benefit obligations. The estimates I have are reported in the 2007 Financial Report of the United States Government and therefore should be in the ballpark; they are for the next 75 years and reveal a Social Security shortfall of about $15-16 trillion and a Medicare gap of approximately $29 trillion. I think it fair to say that shortfalls of these magnitudes are considered both unsustainable and difficult to address.\nOf the topics I have covered this morning, this fiscal imbalance is likely to matter most for the long-run performance of the economy. If debt financed, such deficits are likely to restrain growth over time through their effects on interest rates and, in turn, the consequences for investment, capacity, and productivity. If tax financed, there could be disincentives to work and/or to invest depending on the form of the increases, and the implications for growth would likely be negative. Finally, if program benefits are to be scaled back, it is far preferable to take this step sooner rather than later so that potential beneficiaries can plan appropriately and adjust.\nIn conclusion, I think the Federal Reserve has taken appropriate policy steps to respond to a financial shock, a shock that may well produce parallels to the headwinds episode of the early 1990s. In this environment, we need to remain sensitive to evolving financial conditions and to incoming information on business activity in order to further determine the relevance of that earlier experience.

            "content": "NB: The italics in this talk are from the original speeches.\nLet me begin by welcoming you, once again, to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and also by telling you what a pleasure it is to sponsor this conference with the University of Minnesota. I've had the privilege of leading this institution for a number of years now, and it has been a rewarding experience to observe and participate in the fruitful relationship that exists between the Bank and the University.\nWorking together, the University's economics department and the Bank's research department—and you would be forgiven if you think those are one and the same—have produced research that has sparked revolutions in economic theory and monetary policymaking, and has even helped spawn a Nobel Prize or two along the way. In addition, this academic partnership—which is further realized by the Bank's cooperation with the University's Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs, its Journalism and Law schools, and other departments—has generated educational programs and influenced public policy initiatives, often in surprising ways. In that regard, perhaps none is more surprising than forming an Early Childhood Research Collaborative and holding research conferences on the subject of early childhood development.\nI use the word \"surprising\" because when you think of the Federal Reserve and its research and policy responsibilities, the first topic that comes to mind is likely not early childhood development. Frankly, it is unlikely to be even the second or third topic that comes to mind. But that's changing. Increasingly, state and local governments are looking to their Federal Reserve banks for support on this emerging issue—and not just the Minneapolis Fed. Why is this happening? Let me begin to answer that question by citing some recent speeches by my colleagues in the Fed:\nSandy Pianalto said that when she became president of the Cleveland Fed, she asked her research department to put a sharper focus on the issues that are shaping her district. Education was at the top of the list. \"We all should care about this issue,\" Sandy said, \"and I am convinced that it begins with early childhood education.\"\nJanet Yellen, president of the San Francisco Fed, has noted that \"skill acquisition is a cumulative process that works most effectively when a solid foundation has been provided in early childhood. As such, programs to support early childhood development, such as preschool programs for disadvantaged children, not only appear to have substantial payoffs early but also are likely to continue paying off throughout the life cycle.\"\nFinally, a few words from Jeff Lacker at Richmond: \"On many issues, the economics of the question are not decisive, though economics does tend to spotlight the often-overlooked costs associated with many otherwise seemingly attractive ideas. On some questions, however, economic research sends a fairly clear message. I believe that early childhood development is such an issue.\"\nSo as you can see, other Federal Reserve banks have also been out front on this seemingly un-Fed-like topic. But let me step back and put these statements in a broader context that will further explain why the Federal Reserve has taken an active interest in early childhood development.\nAs all of you know, this country's central banking system includes 12 district banks and a Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. While the role and purpose of those 12 district banks could be the subject of a separate speech, one clear function of those banks is to understand what makes their regional economies tick. This recalls Sandy Pianalto's charge to her research department: Tell me what issues matter most to our district's economy.\nThis charge is one shared by all Federal Reserve banks, and it is a responsibility that has attained a sharper focus in recent decades as Congress has passed a series of laws, beginning with the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, to ensure equal access to financial services and equal opportunity for all citizens. More than just supervising banks to ensure that they are upholding the letter of the law, Federal Reserve banks are working with their local communities on issues ranging from housing to credit availability to education.\nBut it's not just our district economies and our legal mandates that have motivated us to take a hard look at education: This topic circles back to core economic research, the very kind that the Bank and University have contributed to over the years. One such field of investigation is that which compares the economies of various countries and tries to answer one of the most vexing questions in economics: Why are some nations rich and others poor?\nBob Lucas has made important contributions to this line of research, especially on the issue of human capital. In a 2003 Annual Report essay for the Minneapolis Fed, Lucas made a key point that has relevance for the work done by many of you in this room: \"It is a unique feature of human capital that it yields returns that cannot be captured entirely by its ‘owner.' … These pervasive external effects introduce a kind of feedback into human capital theory: Something that increases the return on human capital will stimulate greater accumulation, in turn stimulating higher returns, stimulating still greater accumulation and so on.\" The key words there are \"and so on.\" To all of you familiar with the benefit/cost ratio attributed to certain early childhood development programs, the \"and so on\" of these programs adds up to some serious positive external effects.\nOn the question of the comparative wealth of nations, Lucas famously said that once you start thinking about that question, it's hard to think of anything else. I would suggest that the same is true at a more micro level for the United States: When you start thinking about why some states and cities are richer than others, it's hard to think of anything else. It's a motivating question that, when you come right down to it, frames much of the economic and policy debate in this country. And if the answer to this question involves human capital, then the next question follows: Why are some states and cities better educated, or better at education, than others? These are the types of questions that perplex policymakers and economists, and also Federal Reserve banks, and that's why we keep asking them.\nAnd, of course, there are no easy answers, which is why all of you made the questionable decision to travel to Minnesota in December. You would think that with all of that intellectual firepower that I referred to at the beginning of this speech, we would have picked a more temperate month for you to pay a visit. Or maybe this just reveals how serious we are about this topic, and how seriously all of you take this issue.\nBefore I close, I want to briefly describe the current efforts under way here at the Minneapolis Fed on this issue. As many of you know, Art Rolnick and Rob Grunewald, following on the work of some of you in this room, have been making the economic case for early childhood programs for at-risk children for a number of years. Over this time, they have been challenged by skeptics to bring their ideas to scale. It's one thing to cite focused studies with relatively small numbers of families and tout the high returns, these skeptics say, but it's quite another to actually implement those ideas in a broad way.\nArt and Rob accepted that challenge and drafted a proposal that, in effect, puts the market to work to stimulate demand and create a supply of quality child care programs. I won't go into the details here, but I will add that Art and Rob's plan—as adopted by the Minnesota Early Learning Fund, a unique nonprofit funded mostly by corporate donations—will get its first real test in St. Paul beginning in January, when 1,200 at-risk families will receive scholarships for high-quality child care. Additionally, other Twin Cities school districts, as well as those in rural Minnesota and other parts of the country, have begun programs that incorporate Art and Rob's market-based approach. Will the skeptics be proved wrong? Time will tell, but as an economist, I can say that I'm hopeful. Finally, I would like to end with a fitting quote from Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, who gave a talk earlier this year on this very subject:\n\"Although education and the acquisition of skills is a lifelong process, starting early in life is crucial. Recent research—some sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis in collaboration with the University of Minnesota—has documented the high returns that early childhood programs can pay in terms of subsequent educational attainment and in lower rates of social problems, such as teenage pregnancy and welfare dependency. The most successful early childhood programs appear to be those that cultivate both cognitive and noncognitive skills and that engage families in stimulating learning at home.\"\nThere's that partnership again. And in that quote, Bernanke also makes reference to the academic work underpinning this conference, for he cites research by Jim Heckman, who of course is in attendance. And speaking of Jim, I would be remiss not to acknowledge the huge debt that the profession owes him for almost single-handedly establishing the economic bona fides of this issue. His research was the foundation for the work produced at this Bank and by the University and has influenced every serious economic and policy research project on this issue, which means he has also had a vicarious hand in many of the policy reforms taking place across the country—however nervous that makes him feel.\nThank you very much.\n\nNB: The italics in this talk are from the original speeches.\n\nLet me begin by welcoming you, once again, to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and also by telling you what a pleasure it is to sponsor this conference with the University of Minnesota. I've had the privilege of leading this institution for a number of years now, and it has been a rewarding experience to observe and participate in the fruitful relationship that exists between the Bank and the University.\n\nWorking together, the University's economics department and the Bank's research department—and you would be forgiven if you think those are one and the same—have produced research that has sparked revolutions in economic theory and monetary policymaking, and has even helped spawn a Nobel Prize or two along the way. In addition, this academic partnership—which is further realized by the Bank's cooperation with the University's Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs, its Journalism and Law schools, and other departments—has generated educational programs and influenced public policy initiatives, often in surprising ways. In that regard, perhaps none is more surprising than forming an Early Childhood Research Collaborative and holding research conferences on the subject of early childhood development.\n\nI use the word \"surprising\" because when you think of the Federal Reserve and its research and policy responsibilities, the first topic that comes to mind is likely not early childhood development. Frankly, it is unlikely to be even the second or third topic that comes to mind. But that's changing. Increasingly, state and local governments are looking to their Federal Reserve banks for support on this emerging issue—and not just the Minneapolis Fed. Why is this happening? Let me begin to answer that question by citing some recent speeches by my colleagues in the Fed:\n\nSandy Pianalto said that when she became president of the Cleveland Fed, she asked her research department to put a sharper focus on the issues that are shaping her district. Education was at the top of the list. \"We all should care about this issue,\" Sandy said, \"and I am convinced that it begins with early childhood education.\"\n\nJanet Yellen, president of the San Francisco Fed, has noted that \"skill acquisition is a cumulative process that works most effectively when a solid foundation has been provided in early childhood. As such, programs to support early childhood development, such as preschool programs for disadvantaged children, not only appear to have substantial payoffs early but also are likely to continue paying off throughout the life cycle.\"\n\nFinally, a few words from Jeff Lacker at Richmond: \"On many issues, the economics of the question are not decisive, though economics does tend to spotlight the often-overlooked costs associated with many otherwise seemingly attractive ideas. On some questions, however, economic research sends a fairly clear message. I believe that early childhood development is such an issue.\"\n\nSo as you can see, other Federal Reserve banks have also been out front on this seemingly un-Fed-like topic. But let me step back and put these statements in a broader context that will further explain why the Federal Reserve has taken an active interest in early childhood development.\n\nAs all of you know, this country's central banking system includes 12 district banks and a Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. While the role and purpose of those 12 district banks could be the subject of a separate speech, one clear function of those banks is to understand what makes their regional economies tick. This recalls Sandy Pianalto's charge to her research department: Tell me what issues matter most to our district's economy.\n\nThis charge is one shared by all Federal Reserve banks, and it is a responsibility that has attained a sharper focus in recent decades as Congress has passed a series of laws, beginning with the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, to ensure equal access to financial services and equal opportunity for all citizens. More than just supervising banks to ensure that they are upholding the letter of the law, Federal Reserve banks are working with their local communities on issues ranging from housing to credit availability to education.\n\nBut it's not just our district economies and our legal mandates that have motivated us to take a hard look at education: This topic circles back to core economic research, the very kind that the Bank and University have contributed to over the years.

As a general statement, this may seem self-evident, but specific cases illustrate the challenging nature of such tradeoffs and strongly suggest that the correct course of action, when put to a cost/benefit test, may be far from obvious. Policymakers have faced such tradeoffs before; indeed, the transition from Basel I to Basel II can be viewed as a move from a relatively simple, low cost regime with limited ability to link bank capital to institutional risk-taking to a more complex framework with the potential to establish a stronger connection between capital and risk.\nIn these remarks, I plan to consider recent events in credit markets and to explore lessons we might take from them and policy choices we might make. Let me emphasize at the outset that, as always, I am speaking only for myself and not for others in the Federal Reserve.  Further, let me remind you that it is exceptionally early to begin a retrospective of recent experience: certainly some situations are far from resolved, and thus identification of principal lessons learned from the disruption will necessarily be incomplete and probably prioritized inadequately as well. Nevertheless, I think we can say something meaningful about potential reforms and about the tradeoffs inherent in their adoption. These are important matters; if I am right about tradeoffs, then some reforms might impose significant costs and contribute to outcomes we would prefer to avoid.  Ultimately, policymakers could find themselves relearning old lessons rather than improving social welfare.\nThese comments are organized along the following lines. I will begin by identifying an issue raised by the recent financial turbulence and consider a potential policy response, highlighting the tradeoffs embodied in the response. I will consider four such issues. These discussions are at a fairly high level, but I would expect the tradeoffs to hold at the micro-level as well. \nPolicymakers will certainly find opportunities to improve current regulations and practices; the status quo will need to change in some areas. But, as we will see, and as foreshadowed previously, tradeoffs suggest that policymakers will want to be extraordinarily careful in addressing perceived inadequacies in the current environment.\nThe Originate to Distribute Model\nHigher than expected losses on subprime mortgages were the proximate catalyst for the recent turmoil in credit markets. And many observers have attributed poor performance of these mortgages to the \"originate to distribute\" model commonplace in the mortgage market.  With originate to distribute, the steps underlying the production of a mortgage are divided into distinct activities, frequently with different entities carrying out each. For example, mortgage brokers might market various mortgage products to customers, another firm might purchase mortgages and pool them, and still other investors might ultimately fund them, with another firm servicing the mortgages after origination.\nBecause of the many hand-offs in the process—and the terms of the contracts between at least some of the firms—a number of the firms involved in the process did not have a clear stake in the longer-run performance of the mortgage. The incentives in this model, then, may have encouraged large-scale production of low-quality mortgages.  Moreover, this system distributes mortgage risk to a wide range of investors, many of whom do not have to reveal in detail (or at all) their holdings. Diffuse distribution of risk follows in this context because the original funders of the mortgages likely have modified their exposures through sales of structured financial products, some of which, by the way, may be difficult to understand and to evaluate.\nWide distribution, and the complexity of structured products, may obscure where risks truly reside. In these circumstances, should ultimate investors decide that they want to reduce their exposure to subprime mortgages, they may be unsure about which assets to sell or from which firms to pull funding, leading them as a defensive measure to curtail exposures to a wide range of assets and firms, some of which may in fact have little to do with the subprime market.\nBy implication, this litany of issues and concerns may commend the \"vertically integrated\" approach to lending, wherein a bank takes the loan and its risk on its balance sheet and earns all the revenue and pays all the expenses associated with it. In this world, the residence of the risk would be relatively clear. \nHowever, having a single institution carry out all the activities associated with mortgage lending, or similarly with other loans, does not eliminate principal-agent problems. We all know that, even within firms, it is essential to get the incentives and contracts right so that all work to achieve the same goal.\nAnd the alternative—the originate to distribute model—has a core and fundamental economic advantage propelling it: specialization. Over time, firms have developed that specialize in the distinct steps of the lending process, from originating the loan to funding it. Such specialization contributes importantly to cost efficiencies, innovation, and a broadening of access to financial capital.  Another advantage of the model is diversification; the originate to distribute process allows a firm to significantly diversity the asset side of its balance sheet.\nIn short, these benefits are valuable in that they facilitate effective use of resources.  Actions to limit specialization and diversification would therefore likely to be costly, with adverse consequences for economic performance and living standards over time. Policymakers would need to consider such costs in assessing reforms proposed to constrain the originate to distribute model.\nReliance of External Credit Analysis\nSome observers have identified reliance on the work of credit rating agencies as a dramatic case of the downside of specialization—of separating out aspects of the credit extension process. In particular, it is asserted that investors gave too much credence to the views of the rating agencies and failed to do enough independent credit analysis.  While not an expert in this area, I think it important that we think critically about what constitutes excessive reliance on external credit analysis in these circumstances.\nIf critics mean that there is some systematic failing in the existing rating process and that this is not apparent to those who use the ratings, then reforms in this area may be fully appropriate. But if instead observers are concerned that the rating agencies simply got expected outcomes wrong in some sense (as they have before), then reforms that might subvert the agencies and the information they provide may simultaneously impose significant costs.\nTo be specific, it could be exceptionally costly for each investor to build the infrastructure required to conduct serious credit analysis, and these costs need to be weighed against the losses suffered by investors in the current regime. Moreover, were the agencies unique in underestimating the losses in, say, the subprime mortgage market?  It is not obvious that a different infrastructure will produce better results.\nMore positively, the rating agencies represent one way of economizing on the production of information on credit instruments. And by charging issuers, they also try to address the public nature of this information for, once the information is produced, there is almost no cost to distributing it and hence it is otherwise difficult to get paid. Absent these charges, there could be too little credit information produced.  Overall then, reforms that might compromise the viability of the agencies or discourage use of ratings present the tradeoff of potentially raising costs and ultimately requiring another solution to the issues the agencies help to address.\nExcessive \"Liquidity\"\nPrior to this summer's experience, some commentators had noted that both the volume of subprime lending and the returns required on risky assets had moved into the tails of historic experience (or even beyond historic experience). Some interpreted this observation to suggest that the level of risk taking, both by investors and home buyers, was not sustainable. Moreover, some observers attributed outsized risk taking to provision of \"excessive liquidity,\" an evocative but highly imprecise term, on the part of central banks. Others attributed the situation to the so-called savings glut.\nIn either case, some have asserted that preemptive action on the part of central banks—and particularly the Federal Reserve—could have cooled the credit markets and at least damped the excesses and losses suffered by subprime mortgage borrowers and investors. This argument deserves serious consideration, but it should be recognized that such preemptive action is not without costs.\nTo wit, we cannot pretend that actions which effectively curtail subprime lending won't have a negative effect on homeownership since, after all, many subprime borrowers continue to meet their financial obligations and reside in their homes. As advertised in previous comments, there is a tradeoff here that requires careful calibration as policies are considered; foreclosures might well have been avoided if subprime lending were reined in, but in all likelihood homeownership would have been lower than otherwise as well.\nMore broadly, most of the tools which central banks have at their disposal are blunt instruments which do not permit policymakers to narrowly target their effects. An increase in interest rates designed, say, to address excessive liquidity will likely have restrictive effects on a wide range of households and businesses. Again, we shouldn't pretend that these consequences don't exist; they must be part of the cost-benefit calculation of policy alternatives.\nInterestingly, the excesses in asset prices perceived in recent years seem related, at least casually, to innovation. Consider the run-up in prices of technology stocks in the late 1990's and this year's turbulence linked to pricing of structured financial products and subprime mortgages.  It may be costly to try to address these situations ex ante if, in fact, such actions would inhibit the underlying innovation. Common to all of these concerns is the difficulty of appropriately valuing financial assets.  It is quite plausible that, in pursuing preemptive action, the unintended consequences rival or exceed the desired outcomes.\nRisk Taking and Government Support\nA classic tradeoff facing policymakers concerns financial stability and market discipline. Greater reliance on market disciple runs the risk of less stability. And stability can seemingly be assured through government support which overrides the occasionally harsh dictates of the market.\nBut as we know, government support involves substantial costs of its own. Elimination of market discipline encourages excessive risk taking on the part of financial institutions which, in turn, makes financial disruptions both potentially more likely and more costly.  It would seem, then, that an appropriate balance has to be struck here, and that policymakers have to determine their tolerance for the tradeoff between market discipline and instability.\nWhile true in general, I do think that the market discipline—instability tradeoff has been exaggerated.  In fact, by taking steps to reduce the threat that the failure of a large bank, or decline in asset values in one market, will spillover to other institutions or markets, policymakers can actually increase market discipline and simultaneously achieve greater financial stability.\nLet me expand on how we might approach this happy state of affairs.  Right now, uninsured credits or large banks likely expect government support in the event of problems at such institutions. This is the \"too big to fail\" problem which arises because creditors know full well that policymakers worry about so-called contagion effects—the possibility that weakness at one bank will spillover to other banks and other markets and perhaps ultimately to the real economy. Protection of uninsured creditors forestalls or at least limits the costs of such spillovers.\nBut if policymakers act in advance to reduce the probability and/or magnitude of spillovers, they also reduce the incentive to protect creditors. And if creditors accurately perceive the change in circumstances, they then have greater incentive to appropriately apply market discipline.\nWhat kind of proposals might accomplish these ends? I have co-authored a book which addresses these matters in detail; suffice it to say here that constructive proposals range from limiting the size of losses in the first place (a form of effective prompt corrective action) to reducing the degree to which exposures on payments systems can act as the conduit for spillovers. One specific option we discuss in the book is scenario planning, which might usefully simulate, for example, a failing bank situation. Policymakers can, in the simulation exercise, consider if they have or can get adequate information, if they have adequate powers to address the situation, and what if any changes may be advisable prior to the development of a real problem. \nThe collapse of Northern Rock—a large mortgage lender in the United Kingdom—provides evidence of the potential importance of such simulations. There are ongoing discussions in the U.K. about the adequacy of stress tests and contingency planning in light of Northern Rock. Without claiming to know the preparatory steps the British authorities took, one might imagine that recent experiences might contribute to potential improvements in regulators' simulations.\nIf and as authorities take steps to reduce potential contagion effects and thereby lay the foundation for enhanced market discipline, timely communication of such activities becomes important. Policymakers need to assure that creditors understand that prospects for protection are diminishing, so that they in turn can act accordingly. It may be difficult to communicate effectively in the midst of turmoil, as the Northern Rock case suggests. The Bank of England hoped that its announced support of Northern Rock would stem the run on the bank but the initial communication appeared to have the opposite effect. A lesson here is that it is important to communicate credible intentions and plans prior to the onset of a crisis.\nConclusion\nMy comments this morning are not intended to defend the regulatory and financial status quo, although I can understand that some may interpret them in that way. Rather, they are meant to suggest that there is likely little, if any, \"low hanging fruit\" to harvest and that, specifically, reforms may well impose inefficiencies and other costs of their own. The message is thus one of caution but not of inaction:  we should take considerable care in drawing conclusions about the origins of the recent bout of financial turbulence and about the implications for public policy.\n\nThe overarching theme of my remarks this morning is that regulators of the financial services industry are likely, perhaps inevitably, to confront difficult tradeoffs in designing policies responsive to the recent tumult in financial markets.

This argument deserves serious consideration, but it should be recognized that such preemptive action is not without costs.\n\nTo wit, we cannot pretend that actions which effectively curtail subprime lending won't have a negative effect on homeownership since, after all, many subprime borrowers continue to meet their financial obligations and reside in their homes. As advertised in previous comments, there is a tradeoff here that requires careful calibration as policies are considered; foreclosures might well have been avoided if subprime lending were reined in, but in all likelihood homeownership would have been lower than otherwise as well.\n\nMore broadly, most of the tools which central banks have at their disposal are blunt instruments which do not permit policymakers to narrowly target their effects. An increase in interest rates designed, say, to address excessive liquidity will likely have restrictive effects on a wide range of households and businesses. Again, we shouldn't pretend that these consequences don't exist; they must be part of the cost-benefit calculation of policy alternatives.\n\nInterestingly, the excesses in asset prices perceived in recent years seem related, at least casually, to innovation. Consider the run-up in prices of technology stocks in the late 1990's and this year's turbulence linked to pricing of structured financial products and subprime mortgages.  It may be costly to try to address these situations ex ante if, in fact, such actions would inhibit the underlying innovation. Common to all of these concerns is the difficulty of appropriately valuing financial assets.  It is quite plausible that, in pursuing preemptive action, the unintended consequences rival or exceed the desired outcomes.\n\nA classic tradeoff facing policymakers concerns financial stability and market discipline. Greater reliance on market disciple runs the risk of less stability. And stability can seemingly be assured through government support which overrides the occasionally harsh dictates of the market.\n\nBut as we know, government support involves substantial costs of its own. Elimination of market discipline encourages excessive risk taking on the part of financial institutions which, in turn, makes financial disruptions both potentially more likely and more costly.  It would seem, then, that an appropriate balance has to be struck here, and that policymakers have to determine their tolerance for the tradeoff between market discipline and instability.\n\nWhile true in general, I do think that the market discipline—instability tradeoff has been exaggerated.  In fact, by taking steps to reduce the threat that the failure of a large bank, or decline in asset values in one market, will spillover to other institutions or markets, policymakers can actually increase market discipline and simultaneously achieve greater financial stability.\n\nLet me expand on how we might approach this happy state of affairs.  Right now, uninsured credits or large banks likely expect government support in the event of problems at such institutions. This is the \"too big to fail\" problem which arises because creditors know full well that policymakers worry about so-called contagion effects—the possibility that weakness at one bank will spillover to other banks and other markets and perhaps ultimately to the real economy. Protection of uninsured creditors forestalls or at least limits the costs of such spillovers.\n\nBut if policymakers act in advance to reduce the probability and/or magnitude of spillovers, they also reduce the incentive to protect creditors. And if creditors accurately perceive the change in circumstances, they then have greater incentive to appropriately apply market discipline.\n\nWhat kind of proposals might accomplish these ends? I have co-authored a book which addresses these matters in detail; suffice it to say here that constructive proposals range from limiting the size of losses in the first place (a form of effective prompt corrective action) to reducing the degree to which exposures on payments systems can act as the conduit for spillovers. One specific option we discuss in the book is scenario planning, which might usefully simulate, for example, a failing bank situation. Policymakers can, in the simulation exercise, consider if they have or can get adequate information, if they have adequate powers to address the situation, and what if any changes may be advisable prior to the development of a real problem.\n\nThe collapse of Northern Rock—a large mortgage lender in the United Kingdom—provides evidence of the potential importance of such simulations. There are ongoing discussions in the U.K. about the adequacy of stress tests and contingency planning in light of Northern Rock. Without claiming to know the preparatory steps the British authorities took, one might imagine that recent experiences might contribute to potential improvements in regulators' simulations.\n\nIf and as authorities take steps to reduce potential contagion effects and thereby lay the foundation for enhanced market discipline, timely communication of such activities becomes important. Policymakers need to assure that creditors understand that prospects for protection are diminishing, so that they in turn can act accordingly. It may be difficult to communicate effectively in the midst of turmoil, as the Northern Rock case suggests. The Bank of England hoped that its announced support of Northern Rock would stem the run on the bank but the initial communication appeared to have the opposite effect. A lesson here is that it is important to communicate credible intentions and plans prior to the onset of a crisis.\n\nMy comments this morning are not intended to defend the regulatory and financial status quo, although I can understand that some may interpret them in that way. Rather, they are meant to suggest that there is likely little, if any, \"low hanging fruit\" to harvest and that, specifically, reforms may well impose inefficiencies and other costs of their own. The message is thus one of caution but not of inaction:  we should take considerable care in drawing conclusions about the origins of the recent bout of financial turbulence and about the implications for public policy."

            "content": "Good afternoon. As President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, I regularly hear from the directors of our branch in Helena, who keep me informed of economic developments in Montana. All the same, I appreciate the opportunity to see for myself and meet face-to-face with business and community leaders at events like this. Through these meetings, the regional structure of the Federal Reserve System, with its 12 independent district banks and their regional branches, contributes to a healthy two-way flow of information between Federal Reserve officials and the American people, and in a few minutes I?ll come back to why that?s valuable. But, first, let me talk about the status of economic education in the United States. Although this may seem to be a completely different topic, I?ll explain why I see connections that are important to all of us.\nYesterday I had the privilege of making some remarks in Washington, D.C., as part of the official release of Nation?s Report Card on Economics. This Report Card is part of a series of similar assessments of elementary and secondary educational achievement that the U.S. Department of Education has conducted for many years in subjects like reading, mathematics, science, and more. However, they had never assessed economics education. That changed in 2006, when over 11,000 twelfth-grade students from 590 public and private schools nationwide were tested on their knowledge of how markets and national and international economies work.\nI was happy to take part on the panel marking the release of the Report Card on economics education, for at least three reasons. First, I clearly think that economic knowledge, and hence economics education, are important. Although I am speaking only for myself and not for the Federal Reserve, I will argue that policymaking becomes easier and more effective the better the general public understands economics. Second, like many economists, I think that incentives, and thus accountability, matter. For that reason, I welcomed the Department of Education?s decision to extend its program of educational assessment to include economics.\nFinally, and especially, I was pleased that the results of the assessment were better than I had expected. Seventy-nine percent of the students demonstrated at least a basic knowledge of high school economics, and 42 percent performed at a proficient level, including 3 percent who demonstrated advanced knowledge. The assessment also showed that most 12th graders get at least some economics education in high school. Sixteen percent said they?d had an advanced economics course, such as Advanced Placement (AP) economics, and an additional 49 percent had taken general economics. About a quarter of the students had taken a business course, a personal finance course, or a course, such as government, that included a unit in economics. Only 13 percent said they?d had no formal instruction in economics.\nOf course, I still see ample room for improvement, and I hope to see even better marks in the next economics report card in 2012. I also hope that the disparities revealed in this Report Card in the achievement levels of students from different backgrounds will shrink and, before long, disappear. Nonetheless, as an economic policymaker, I was encouraged that even now a large majority of American high school seniors have at least a basic understanding of economic principles and that many have achieved a degree of proficiency in economic reasoning. That?s a good base to build on and a credit to the teachers, parents, and others who guide our nation?s youth.\nSeveral of those leaders in economics education are in the room today. I?d particularly like to recognize one of them, our Helena Branch Manager, Sam Gane. You may know that Sam will be retiring soon, after a long and distinguished career with the Federal Reserve in Cleveland, Minneapolis, and Helena. What you may not know is that since 1999 Sam has been a member of the board of directors of the Montana Council on Economic Education and served as the board?s president from 2002 to 2004. At the Branch, he maintained a tradition of partnering with the Council to sponsor the Montana High School Economics Challenge, a statewide economics knowledge competition that completed its 12th year last February. Under Sam?s leadership, the Helena Branch and the Council also co-sponsored last year?s first ever Montana Economic Education Summit, and they are working together on next month?s second annual Summit in Helena as well. Sam, in addition to noting your many other contributions, I want to express a special ?thank you? for your leadership in economic education.\nSam?s upcoming retirement prompts me to make a few comments about our plans for the Helena Branch. First of all, the Branch will remain in good hands. We recently announced that Sam?s successor as Branch Manager will be Paul Drake, the current AVP at the Branch. Paul has a proven record of leadership, having worked closely with Sam for many years and having played a leading role in the difficult but necessary downsizing and restructuring of the Branch over the past two years.\nThis restructuring is part of an overall Federal Reserve System plan to bring our check processing business not only into the 21st century but also into the black. As one who has been very close to this effort, I can assure you that Helena was not singled out. Due to the rapid decline in the volume of paper checks since 1995, the Federal Reserve has reduced its check processing sites from 45 in 2003 to 19 by the end of this year, and we expect to be down to about 4 sites by 2010. As part of our ongoing national restructuring, we recently announced that check processing at the Federal Reserve Bank in Minneapolis, a large volume site, will be phased out as well, in the fourth quarter of 2009.\nAlthough leaner than before, the Helena Branch will retain key functions in areas such as banking supervision, cash processing, and community outreach and economic education. In addition, the Branch will have a full slate of directors who will continue to play important roles in providing information on economic and banking conditions in Montana and helping us reach the people of the State. In other words, we are committed to maintaining the Branch?s role in the two-way flow of information that I mentioned earlier.\nIn this regard, I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge and genuinely thank two Helena Branch directors who will be leaving the Board at the end of the year, namely Joy Ott and Larry Simkins. Thank you for your service, and for the quality of the information you brought to the ?table.? One of the strengths of policymaking in the Federal Reserve is the first-hand, timely economic intelligence provided by directors like Joy and Larry. Their information and anecdotes mean that we are not wholly captive of statistics published with a lag that necessarily provide a somewhat dated picture of business activity.\nOn that note, let me try to bring some of the strands of my remarks together by reviewing how the public?s understanding of economic principles contributes to good policymaking. As I have discussed at greater length in other contexts, enduring economic progress and prosperity depend on public institutions? ability to commit to policies that are optimal over the long haul, across the temporary ups and downs of the business cycle. In a democracy, such policy commitments can only be sustained with broad public support, and public support for good policies depends, in turn, on voters? competence in basic economic reasoning.\nTangible evidence of the connection between good policies and public understanding can be found in our experience with monetary policy during and after the 1970s. From 1973 to 1981, the U.S. economy experienced a period of sustained high inflation; consumer prices rose by about 9 percent per year, on average, over that period. These high inflation rates distorted economic decisions, hindered growth, pushed interest rates to record levels, and weakened our financial system. Adding to the problem was the widespread view that high inflation was here to stay, a ?fact of life? to be accepted and adjusted to. Today we know that this view was too pessimistic. Under Paul Volcker, the Federal Reserve made a commitment to get inflation down and keep it down. Chairman Volcker kept that commitment, and it has been unambiguously extended by his successors, Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke.\nAlthough the Federal Reserve?s firm commitment to a policy of long-term low inflation was essential in this process, support from the public was just as critical. This was especially so during Chairman Volcker?s tenure, when the shift to a consistent anti-inflationary policy entailed painful adjustments for many consumers and businesses. Chairman Volcker?s public statements helped guide the public to a consensus that inflation hurts economic growth and thereby, over time, most citizens. Inflation has now been reasonably well contained for roughly two decades or so, and the firm consensus in favor of price stability has been sustained. One reason, I think, is that under Chairman Greenspan, the Federal Reserve took a series of steps in an effort to communicate more clearly with the public, including financial market participants, about its objectives and its policies. Chairman Bernanke has embraced and extended that effort. As a result, the public continues to understand the long-term benefits of low inflation and thus to support the Federal Reserve?s pursuit of this objective as one element of our dual mandate. I think this is an excellent example of the value of economic knowledge.\nThe Fed?s commitment to a low-inflation policy, and its increased emphasis on clearly communicating both that commitment and the decisions taken to implement it, are part of a world-wide trend. As explained in an essay by V.V. Chari and Patrick Kehoe in the Minneapolis Fed's 2006 annual report, central banks around the world seem to have learned some of the key lessons of modern macroeconomic theory. This theory stresses that policymakers must always consider how their current policy choices will affect expectations of future policies. In a sense, this is an old lesson—that policymakers can?t say one thing and do another, and that actions speak louder that words. But modern macroeconomic theory has clarified how these adages specifically apply to monetary policy.\nThere is insufficient time this afternoon to review the arguments provided in the Annual Report in detail, and I do not want to try your patience excessively. By the way of summary, let me just say that, in effect, modern macroeconomic theory stresses the importance of a high degree of communication and mutual understanding between the central bank and the public. The central bank needs to convincingly convey to the public the substance and logic of a credible long-term commitment to low inflation. Credibility and transparency also require it to explain its other objectives, such as the maximum employment objective that is the second part of the dual mandate of the Federal Reserve.\nFrom this perspective, the importance of economic education is clear. The public?s understanding of basic economic concepts and principles is vital to sustaining sound long-term policies in a democracy. Although citizens can come to a basic level of economic knowledge through many channels, high-quality elementary and secondary instruction in at least basic economic concepts is probably the most efficient and effective method for achieving widespread understanding.\nThe importance of clear communication about monetary policy also helps us understand some of the advantages of the Federal Reserve System?s regional structure of district banks and branches. On the one side, having directors, advisory councils, meetings like this, and other contacts in our districts (and outside of Washington D.C.) improves both the Federal Reserve?s understanding of economic conditions and the public?s views of our policies and of our credibility. On the other side, a regional presence helps us communicate the substance and rationale of our policy decisions effectively.\nSo far, I have focused on monetary policy and the benefits of an economically educated citizenry, but the benefits extend to other aspects of Federal Reserve responsibilities. Today we are witnessing some painful and belated learning, by policymakers and consumers alike, in our consumer financial markets. As you are probably well aware, consumers today have access to a wide array of borrowing and savings options. In itself, variety is good, because it expands opportunities and choice. However, variety also fosters complexity, which challenges both consumers in their decision making and financial regulators in their writing and enforcement of rules.\nThis is not the occasion to go into the details of how the Fed and the other financial regulators are responding, but I would like to use some simple economics to make a connection between financial regulation and economic education. In short, I view regulation aimed at protecting consumers and consumer education as substitutes. If consumers are more educated and able to make good decisions on their own, regulations can be narrower and more focused on clearly abusive practices such as deceit and fraud.\nThis is valuable, because as the scope of regulation widens, so does the cost. I?m not just referring to enforcement costs, which are high enough. More significant, in my view, are the extra compliance burdens that broad regulations impose on legitimate transactions and the opportunities forgone when legitimate potential transactions are prevented outright. Don?t get me wrong. In some cases it is necessary and appropriate that we bear these costs in order to prevent even greater abuses elsewhere. However, regulation involves a tradeoff between preventing harm to some and allowing innovation, gains from trade, and free choice for others. At any given time, we write our regulations as best we can to balance that trade off. Over time, however, we hope that better economic education will soften the trade off and allow us to rely more on consumers? informed decision making and less on broad, formal restrictions. I see the Economics Report Card that I discussed earlier as setting a good benchmark for measuring progress toward that goal.\nI hope my remarks and the examples I have discussed highlight the importance of economic education to good policymaking. I, Sam Gane, and many other Federal Reserve staff are actively involved in supporting economic education. We know that clear communication about public policy and an economically well-educated public are crucial in sustaining good monetary and regulatory policies and, in turn, a prosperous economy. Thank you.\nTop\n\nGood afternoon.

By drawing on its broad experience in educational assessment, the National Assessment can minimize these costs, so that they are outweighed by the benefits of enhanced incentives and accountability.\nFinally, and especially, I am pleased to see that our nation's economics report card is perhaps a bit better than I would have guessed. As a member and former chair of the board of directors of the National Council on Economic Education, I certainly see plenty of room for improvement, and I think this assessment can help guide our efforts toward more effective education in economics. As a result, I hope to see even better results, and smaller disparities among students of different backgrounds, in the next economics report card in 2012.\nBut as an economic policy maker, I am encouraged that even now a large majority of American high school seniors have at least a basic understanding of economic principles and that over 40 percent have reached the Proficient achievement level set by the Governing Board. That's a good base to build on and a credit to the teachers, parents, and others who guide our nation's youth and need our support to achieve even better results.\nI'd like to draw on my experience as a Federal Reserve Bank president to expand a bit on how the public's understanding of economic principles contributes to good policy-making. As I have discussed at greater length elsewhere (Top of the Ninth, The Region, June 2006), enduring economic progress and prosperity depend on public institutions' ability to commit to policies that are optimal over the long haul, across the temporary ups and downs of the business cycle. In a democracy, such policy commitments can only be sustained with broad public support, and public support for good policies depends, in turn, on voters' competence in basic economic reasoning.\nTangible evidence of the connection between good policies and public understanding can be found in our experience with monetary policy during and after the 1970s. Over a decade before today's high school seniors were born, the U.S. economy experienced a period of sustained high inflation. From 1973 to 1981, consumer prices rose by about 9 percent per year, on average. These high inflation rates distorted economic decisions, hindered growth, pushed interest rates to record levels, and weakened our financial system. Adding to the problem was the widespread view that high inflation was here to stay, a \"fact of life\" to be accepted and adjusted to. Today we know that this view was too pessimistic.\nUnder Paul Volcker, the Federal Reserve made a commitment to get inflation down and keep it down. Chairman Volcker kept that commitment, and it has been unambiguously extended by his successors, Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke.\nAlthough the Federal Reserve's firm commitment to a policy of long-term low inflation was essential in this process, support from the public was critical as well. This was especially so during Chairman Volcker's tenure, when the shift to a consistent anti-inflationary policy entailed painful adjustments for many consumers and businesses. Chairman Volcker's public statements helped guide the public to a consensus that inflation hurts economic growth and thereby, over time, most citizens.\nInflation has now been reasonably well contained for roughly two decades or so, and the consensus in favor of price stability has been sustained. One reason, I think, is that under Chairman Greenspan, the Federal Reserve took a series of steps to communicate more clearly with the public, including financial market participants, about its objectives and its policies. Chairman Bernanke has embraced and extended that effort. As a result, the public continues to understand the long-term benefits of low inflation and thus to support the Federal Reserve's pursuit of this objective as one important element of our dual mandate. I think this is an excellent example of the value of economic knowledge.\nThe public was educated about inflation at a high price, amidst the economic dislocations of the 1970s and early 1980s. I prefer that economic education be pursued more benignly, in the classroom and the press, and more proactively, before rather than after it is needed. So I regret to note that today we are again witnessing some painful and belated learning, by policy-makers and consumers alike, in our consumer financial markets.\nAs you are probably well aware, consumers today have access to a wide array of borrowing and savings options. In itself, variety is good, because it expands choice and opportunity. However, variety also fosters complexity, which challenges both consumers in their decision-making and financial regulators in their writing and enforcement of rules.\nThis is not the time to go into the details of how the Federal Reserve and the other financial regulators are responding, but I would like to use some simple economics to make a connection between financial regulation and economic education. In short, I view consumer regulation and consumer education as substitutes. If consumers are more educated and able to make good decisions on their own, regulations can be narrower and more focused on clearly abusive practices such as deceit and fraud.\nThis is valuable, because as the scope of regulation widens, so does the cost. I'm not just referring to enforcement costs, which are high enough. More significant, in my view, are the extra compliance burdens that broad regulations impose on legitimate transactions and the opportunities forgone when legitimate potential transactions are prevented outright.\nDon't get me wrong. In some cases it is necessary and appropriate that we bear these costs in order to prevent even greater abuses elsewhere. However, regulation involves a tradeoff between preventing harm to some and allowing innovation, gains from trade, and free choice for others. At any given time, we write regulations as best we can to balance that trade off. Over time, however, we hope that better economic education will soften the trade off and allow us to rely more on the informed decision-making of consumers and less on formal restrictions.\nIn closing, I hope my remarks help to highlight the importance of economic education and of The Nations Report Card on Economics. I and many other Federal Reserve staff are actively involved in supporting economic education. We know that clear communication about public policy and an economically well-educated public are crucial in sustaining good monetary and regulatory policies and, in turn, a prosperous economy. Accordingly, we value the economics report card as a solid benchmark for measuring progress toward the complementary goals of better education, better policy, and economic growth.\nThank you.\nFor more information go to: Economics Report Card.\n\nI am pleased to join you this morning for release of the first Nation's Report Card on economics for at least three reasons. First, I clearly think that economic knowledge, and hence economics education, are very important. Although I am speaking only for myself today and not for the Federal Reserve System, it seems clear to me that economic policy-making becomes easier and more effective the better the general public understands economics, and I will return to this theme shortly.\n\nSecond, like many economists, I think that incentives, and thus accountability, matter. For that reason, I welcome the decision of the National Assessment Governing Board to extend their program of educational assessment to include economics. Assessment programs can be costly, for the assessors and the assessed alike. By drawing on its broad experience in educational assessment, the National Assessment can minimize these costs, so that they are outweighed by the benefits of enhanced incentives and accountability.\n\nFinally, and especially, I am pleased to see that our nation's economics report card is perhaps a bit better than I would have guessed. As a member and former chair of the board of directors of the National Council on Economic Education, I certainly see plenty of room for improvement, and I think this assessment can help guide our efforts toward more effective education in economics. As a result, I hope to see even better results, and smaller disparities among students of different backgrounds, in the next economics report card in 2012.\n\nBut as an economic policy maker, I am encouraged that even now a large majority of American high school seniors have at least a basic understanding of economic principles and that over 40 percent have reached the Proficient achievement level set by the Governing Board.

            "content": "Good afternoon. It is a distinct pleasure to join you in Dayton and to have the opportunity to speak at this forum. I have titled these remarks \"Perspectives on the Economy\" but a better description might actually be how to think about the U.S. economy. Since I gather that all of you share a keen interest in investments, the ability to accurately understand the economy, and its prospects, could be a significant asset in your human capital portfolio.\nThe U.S. economy is large, diverse, and complex with lots of moving parts, so it is not necessarily easy to gauge what is going on. Still, I think there are lessons from recent history, as well as implications from economic theory, that can aid our understanding and keep us grounded in an environment of exceedingly rapid transmission of data and almost instantaneous analysis, only some of which is of value. Accordingly, my plan today is to interweave a description of the current state of business activity with the performance of the economy over the past 2 ½ decades or so to elucidate some principles appropriate to understanding the economy and assessing its future course. Specifics will be forthcoming momentarily; first, though, let me remind you that I am speaking only for myself and not for others in the Federal Reserve.\nThe current economic expansion began in the fourth quarter of 2001, so it has now proceeded for about 5 ½ years. In itself, this duration is unremarkable; the expansions of the 1980s and 1990s (about which I'll have more to say shortly) lasted about 8 ½ and nearly 10 years, respectively. The latest extended period of growth may appear more impressive, however, when we recall all the concern expressed about its fragility just a few years ago. So, one question relevant to thinking about the economy and, by implication, its likely performance: is the U.S. economy fragile?\nI think the evidence of the past 25 years addresses this issue convincingly. The economy grew uninterruptedly from late 1982 until the middle of 1990, with a substantial net increase in employment economy-wide, diminishing inflation, and strong financial markets. Growth resumed in the spring of 1991, following a mild recession, and persisted, again uninterruptedly, through 2000. Again, the expansion of 1990s was accompanied by sizable job creation, healthy financial markets, and generally low inflation.\nOn the surface, these episodes don't depict a particularly fragile economy, and, if we look a little deeper, concerns about fragility seem even less compelling. Remember that during the 1980s and the 1990s there were on occasion material economic problems at some of our largest trading partners, including Mexico and Japan, and there was the stock market crash of 1987, the Asian financial and Russian debt problems of 1997-98, the demise of many domestic savings and loan institutions and major problems in commercial banking in the late 1980s-early 1990s. Note also that employment in the manufacturing sector peaked in 1979 and has been declining persistently if unevenly since. I'm sure I've excluded some of the shocks to which the economy responded, but the point is that the expansions proceeded largely unimpeded. Rather than fragile, the economy appears resilient and flexible, and these are the characteristics I would emphasize in thinking about the future.\nBut, you might object, didn't monetary or other policies play an important role in stabilizing the economy during these decades and, therefore, doesn't policy deserve credit for the record just described? There are two responses. First, I do think that policy played a constructive role over much of the period but, having said that, I do not think it deserves the lion's share of the credit, much as we policymakers might like to claim it. Rather, the relevant history is largely a testament to the fundamental soundness of our market-based system. Second, and in any event, if in thinking about the future you choose to assign a significant role to monetary policy rest assured that policy, too, will remain sound.\nSo, we have before us a flexible, resilient economy demonstrably capable of sustained economic growth even in the face of disruptions, characterized at the moment by persistent gains in employment and consumer spending, generally liquid financial conditions, and improving activity abroad. In these circumstances, the outlook would seem to be positive as, indeed, I think it is. To be sure, the housing sector has been a drag on activity and is of concern but I suspect that the bulk, although not all, of the adjustment in residential construction is behind us.\nAll of this is not to say that the business cycle has become an historical curiosity. Downturns in business activity will no doubt occur but, as I have learned from hard experience, their timing is exceedingly difficult to forecast accurately. And there may be comfort in recognizing that, overall, the economy appears to have become more stable since the mid-1980's, when the low inflation regime was established.\nAs you no doubt know, there is a virtually continuous flow of statistics on the economy over the course of a month and this \"high frequency data,\" as economists like to say, may assist in identifying changes in conditions. While paying attention to the weekly and monthly reports, I would caution against putting considerable weight on any one of them. Most of the data are notoriously noisy and subject to revision; moreover, they frequently provide inconsistent, if not contradictory, signals. It is valuable, I think, in assessing incoming high frequency reports, to ask whether they are basically in line with your fundamental long-run outlook for the economy or if, alternatively, they represent a significant departure from expectations? To the extent that Federal Reserve communications leave the impression that high frequency observations are of great value, then this is something which I think we need to address. In my experience, a considerable accumulation of evidence usually is required before it is wise to change your view.\nThis warning might provide a convenient place to conclude these remarks, but there is another issue I want to call to your attention because it has important implications for thinking about the economy of the future. Broadly speaking, the issue is demographics and, in particular, the implications of the aging of the population for the labor market and for economic growth. To be sure, demographics also have significant implications for entitlement programs and the Federal budget, but those are matters for another day.\nIn this country, we have become accustomed to (net) increases in employment of at least 150,000-160,000 workers per month on average, roughly equal to the average monthly addition to the labor force. But labor force growth is projected to slow appreciably over the next ten years as the baby boom generation retires; depending on which reputable set of projections you select, we should probably expect monthly increments to the labor force of 110,000 on the low end to 150,000 on the high side. Increases in employment will adjust down similarly, other things equal, since people who are not available cannot be hired. Moreover, to the extent that labor force participation rates level off or decline—and this is widely anticipated in part because of the end of the run-up of participation rates of women—increases in the labor force will be even smaller than the estimates I just cited, probably by several tens of thousands per month.\nDiminution of growth of the labor force could have pronounced implications for economic performance, since the volume of labor input is a major determinant of the aggregate supply of goods and services. Other things equal, slow expansion of the labor force would imply slow growth of the overall economy, at least relative to the experience of the past several decades. But other things may not be equal.\n\nAn acceleration in productivity, for example, could offset (or conceivably more than offset) the moderation in the increase in the labor force and sustain economic growth. Is such a development likely? It is difficult, to put it mildly, to answer this question definitively, but there are reasons to think that productivity may fill at least some of the gap. The fact that people on average live longer than formerly provides an additional incentive to investment in human capital, suggesting that skills, and therefore productivity, should benefit. Returns to education have been substantial for some time and this incentive works in the same direction. Business may also adopt more capital-intensive production processes over time.\nMoreover, it is probably worth taking the labor force projections with a grain of salt. To the extent that the demographics make labor relatively scarce, we would expect compensation to rise more rapidly than otherwise, thereby inducing some to stay in the labor force longer than they otherwise would have, some to enter the labor force earlier than they would have, and some to work longer hours. Employers may also become increasingly flexible about work schedules and locations, for example, in order to improve the attractiveness of participation. Note, also, that I would not expect inflation to accelerate even if compensation does, as long as the Federal Reserve remains committed to a stable, low inflation policy.\nIt seems doubtful that these labor market adjustments will offset fully the effects of changing demographics; nevertheless, they serve to illustrate the inherent flexibility of a market economy in responding to such factors. And, of course, the U.S. participates in a dynamic global economy, suggesting other avenues for flexible adjustment.\nLet me, in wrapping up, briefly summarize the theme of these remarks. Taking a step back, I have essentially been advocating the adoption of a long-run view of the U.S. economy—one that does not put inordinate emphasis on weekly or monthly developments. This longer-run perspective is appropriate to investors and reveals, I think, an economy anything but fragile; instead, a resilient and flexible economy is observed. And, even though demographic trends associated with the labor force might suggest slower growth in prospect over, say, the next ten years, the flexibility inherent in a market economy like ours suggests the likely emergence of changes which will work to moderate, and possibly eliminate, this prospect.\n\nGood afternoon.

            "content": "In these brief remarks, I'm going to explore the implications of two significant developments in financial markets for central bank, and in particular Federal Reserve, responsibilities. The two phenomena I intend to consider are: 1) heightened competition in the domestic financial environment, as evidenced by a proliferation of institutions, instruments, and new markets; and 2) the growing global integration of financial markets. These topics are in the spirit of the conference because I have had the sense that the organizers were interested in subjects that may not be captured altogether neatly in standard macroeconomic models.\nBy the way, both developments seem related to the observed increase in the liquidity of a wide range of assets, a trend which in turn derives from the reduction in information and transaction costs stemming from technological change. Liquidity is a concept the conference organizers also suggested might be worthy of attention, and I am happy to oblige; although the term is notoriously difficult to define, I would hazard that at its core the concept relates to the ease with which an asset can be converted to cash. And I do think that liquidity helps to explain the importance of the developments I will discuss. Finally, let me be clear at the outset that I make no claim for the originality of much of this commentary. I am explicitly drawing on well-established strands in the literature. And, of course, the usual Federal Reserve caveat applies; I am speaking for myself and not for others in the Federal Reserve.\nLet me start with the first phenomenon just noted and describe some of its implications more explicitly. The proliferation we have witnessed in institutions, instruments, and markets presumably allows, on average, both for improved diversification in finance and for greater flexibility in an institution's choice of its risk profile. There are other ramifications as well. As many have reported, investment banks, private equity firms, and hedge funds, among others, have invaded the traditional turf of commercial banks, increasing competition and thereby serving customers increasingly effectively. As financial innovation has progressed, banks—at least many of the largest, most sophisticated institutions—have responded by securitizing and selling off their most standard, commodity-like credits, leaving their balance sheets with a preponderance of relatively heterogeneous, information intensive, illiquid assets.\nSome might think that in this process, and particularly in view of heightened competition, commercial banks have become less important in the financial system overall. John Boyd and Mark Gertler carefully examined this issue about 15 years ago, when there were similar assertions about the diminishing importance of banks.1 Their results, which adjusted for banks' off balance sheet activities and so forth, indicated no quantitative change in banks' role in finance, and recent work by staff at the Minneapolis Federal Reserve, updating Boyd-Gertler, appears to confirm the earlier conclusions, although I should note that the recent work is still quite preliminary.\nNevertheless, I suspect that there has been a significant, qualitative change in the position of large banks as they have adapted to challenges in the environment. In particular, and as foreshadowed a moment ago, as banks have disposed of plain-vanilla, readily securitized assets, their balance sheets may have become more risky.2 Coupled with expansion of off balance sheet activities and growing reliance on trading in a range of instruments and markets, large institutions, and their exposures to various counterparties, likely have become more difficult to manage and to assess.\nThe policy prescriptions stemming from this situation seem relatively straightforward. Concern about the possible vulnerability of, say, hedge funds or the credit derivatives market is well taken, but it shouldn't distract supervisors and policymakers from appropriate focus on more \"familiar\" commercial banks. As I have argued previously, in the context of the too-big-to-fail issue, problems at one or more large, complex commercial banks could potentially have systemic repercussions, and recent developments in banking have not assuaged this concern.3\nSome have made a different argument for continued supervisory focus on commercial banks, suggesting that by assuring that banks have taken appropriate precautions in their lending to, and other transactions with, say, hedge funds and the like, adequate discipline will have been brought to bear on this latter group of institutions. But I'm not confident of this result for, as I implied a moment ago, to the extent that large banks do not face sufficient market discipline, we can't expect them to act altogether effectively as the levee against excessive risk taking outside the banking sector.\nNow, let me move on to the second phenomenon identified in my introductory comments, namely, increasing global financial integration. This is a trend which has received lots of attention and deservedly so. There appears to be a general perception that in fact financial markets worldwide have become more closely intertwined and that financial capital flows more readily across borders than formerly. There is statistical evidence quantifying this development and, from the perspective of resource allocation, such a development is clearly welcome.4\nAt the same time, growing capital market integration has raised some concern about the potential effectiveness of domestic (Federal Reserve) monetary policy. The argument seems to be—and let me emphasize that what follows is for illustrative purposes only—that the effects on long-term interest rates of a Federal Reserve-engineered increase in short-term rates could be largely offset by financial inflows from abroad. Thus, so the story goes, a larger-than-anticipated increase in the Federal funds rate would be required to achieve a given degree of policy restraint or, put more mildly, policymakers would necessarily be more uncertain about the appropriate level of the funds rate in view of the potential for a global response of financial flows.\nAll this strikes me as logical enough, but I am unsure if it is of much moment. In my experience, there is always some, usually considerable, uncertainty attending the appropriate level of and potential changes in the Federal funds rate. An international channel may complicate the analysis incrementally, but there is ample uncertainty in any event. Further, and also to conclude, it seems to me that policy ultimately must be judged against the background of the achievement of the well-recognized dual mandate. Relative to this metric, results look pretty good for the past two decades or so and, relevant to the issue at hand, this record has been established, skillfully or with a lot of good fortune, in an ever-changing environment.\nEndnotes\n1John H.

The two phenomena I intend to consider are: 1) heightened competition in the domestic financial environment, as evidenced by a proliferation of institutions, instruments, and new markets; and 2) the growing global integration of financial markets. These topics are in the spirit of the conference because I have had the sense that the organizers were interested in subjects that may not be captured altogether neatly in standard macroeconomic models.\n\nBy the way, both developments seem related to the observed increase in the liquidity of a wide range of assets, a trend which in turn derives from the reduction in information and transaction costs stemming from technological change. Liquidity is a concept the conference organizers also suggested might be worthy of attention, and I am happy to oblige; although the term is notoriously difficult to define, I would hazard that at its core the concept relates to the ease with which an asset can be converted to cash. And I do think that liquidity helps to explain the importance of the developments I will discuss. Finally, let me be clear at the outset that I make no claim for the originality of much of this commentary. I am explicitly drawing on well-established strands in the literature. And, of course, the usual Federal Reserve caveat applies; I am speaking for myself and not for others in the Federal Reserve.\n\nLet me start with the first phenomenon just noted and describe some of its implications more explicitly. The proliferation we have witnessed in institutions, instruments, and markets presumably allows, on average, both for improved diversification in finance and for greater flexibility in an institution's choice of its risk profile. There are other ramifications as well. As many have reported, investment banks, private equity firms, and hedge funds, among others, have invaded the traditional turf of commercial banks, increasing competition and thereby serving customers increasingly effectively. As financial innovation has progressed, banks—at least many of the largest, most sophisticated institutions—have responded by securitizing and selling off their most standard, commodity-like credits, leaving their balance sheets with a preponderance of relatively heterogeneous, information intensive, illiquid assets.\n\nSome might think that in this process, and particularly in view of heightened competition, commercial banks have become less important in the financial system overall.
