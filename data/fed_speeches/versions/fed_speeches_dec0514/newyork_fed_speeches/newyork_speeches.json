            "content": "Introduction\n\nIt’s great to be with you here today. Queens is a special place. There are so many features that make it unique. It’s one of the country’s most diverse areas. It’s home to not one, but two airports. And it’s the birthplace of so many famous actors and musicians.\n\nThat said, getting around can be complicated. The hyphenated numbers in street addresses. The avenues, roads, and drives that all start with the same number. The fact that you can have a 58th Street that meets a 58th Drive.\n\nNavigating through Queens can be quite a journey. And as the past few years have shown, the same can be said for the economy.\n\nTo give you a roadmap today, I’m going to discuss the rise and fall of inflation—from unacceptably high to within striking distance of the Fed’s 2 percent longer-run goal—as well as the labor market’s return to balance. I’ll also talk about how monetary policy is working to achieve our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. And I’ll provide my economic outlook.\n\nBut before I continue the journey, I will give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nStrong Demand, Strong Supply\n\nIn talking about where the economy has been and where it’s headed, it’s important to take stock of where we are.\n\nRight now, the economy is in a good place. The labor market is solid. Inflation is just above our 2 percent longer-run target—although there have been a few bumps along the way. And GDP growth continues to be strong, averaging about 3 percent per year over the past two years.\n\nAs the economy has returned to balance and inflation has come down, the FOMC has taken steps to move its monetary policy stance from one that constrains demand toward one that is more neutral. In September, the Committee lowered the target range for the federal funds rate by half a percentage point, and last month it lowered it by another quarter of a point.1,2\n\nBut with the strong growth that we’re seeing, I’m often asked the question: Why is the Fed cutting interest rates at all?\n\nThe simple answer is that while growth in demand has been strong, growth in supply has been even stronger. Specifically, robust growth in both the labor force and in productivity has meant that the economy can expand at a higher pace than we saw before the pandemic, without creating inflationary pressures.\n\nImportantly, our mandate is to achieve maximum employment and price stability. That means having demand in line with supply and keeping the risks to achieving our goals in balance.\n\nAnd now that we’ve achieved that balance, our job now is to ensure the risks remain in balance.\n\nOn the Way to 2 Percent\n\nSo that’s the big picture view. Before I go into more detail about monetary policy, I’m going to delve deeper into each side of our dual mandate, starting with inflation.\n\nThe onset of the pandemic in 2020 dealt enormous shocks to the global economy, resulting in extraordinary imbalances from high demand and unprecedented supply disruptions. That, along with Russia’s war against Ukraine and other factors, caused inflation to surge to a 40-year high of over 7 percent in June of 2022, as measured by the 12-month percent change in the personal consumer expenditures (PCE) price index. Inflation has now fallen to around 2-1/4 percent in the latest reading.\n\nStill, inflation remains above our 2 percent longer-run target, and it will take some time to achieve our inflation goal on a sustained basis.\n\nBut there are reasons to be confident that inflation is on its way to 2 percent. To start, it is helpful to look under the hood at various categories of goods and services. Inflation rates for goods and services excluding food, energy, and housing have slowed to levels that are roughly consistent with what we saw from 2002 to 2007, when core inflation was around 2 percent on average. Housing inflation, which largely encompasses rises in rents for rental units and in implied rents for owner-occupied homes, remains elevated compared to that time frame. But I expect the disinflationary process to continue here, too, as lower rates of rent increases for new leases are increasingly reflected in the official inflation measures.\n\nRecent analysis by researchers at the New York Fed reveals another contributing factor to inflation’s surge and subsequent decline.3 In 2021 and 2022, significant, simultaneous increases in wages and material input prices created a perfect storm in the traded goods sector. This extraordinary concurrence of outsized increases constrained the ability of businesses to adjust their input mix to mitigate the cost pressures they were facing. As a result, businesses passed more of those higher costs to the prices of their products.\n\nBut this dynamic began to subside in the middle of 2022, and it appears to be behind us now. This finding is consistent with what I am hearing in my discussions with business leaders in the Second District. Customers are increasingly pushing back against additional price increases, and margins are being compressed.\n\nAnother data point reinforcing my view that inflation is moving to 2 percent is that survey- and market-based measures show that inflation expectations remain well anchored. In particular, the latest Survey of Consumer Expectations shows inflation expectations have stayed within their pre-pandemic ranges across all horizons.4\n\nLabor Market Equilibrium\n\nWhile we are making strides to bring inflation down, the other side of our dual mandate—employment—has also come into balance.\n\nI’m sure many of you remember that in the aftermath of the pandemic, there were far too many job openings and not enough people to fill them. Since then, labor supply has increased meaningfully, and demand has eased.\n\nNow, a wide range of metrics—including measures of vacancies, quits and hires rates, surveys of job and worker availability, and job finding and layoff rates—indicate a cooling in the labor market from the very tight conditions we’ve seen in the past few years. My discussions with business leaders in the region also bear this out.\n\nIn addition, researchers at the New York Fed have developed a measure—the Heise-Pearce-Weber (HPW) Tightness Index—that provides a useful summary of the overall state of the labor market.5 This Index has declined for 10 consecutive quarters. And it is now at the level it was in early 2017, a time when the labor market was solid but not overheated. This decline also has been accompanied by slowing wage growth, which is in line with the model’s prediction. If the HPW Index remains near its current level, the growth rate of the Employment Cost Index should come in at levels that are broadly consistent with 2 percent inflation.\n\nTo cut to the chase, the labor market is unlikely to be a source of inflationary pressures going forward.\n\nShifting to Neutral\n\nWhat does this all mean for monetary policy?\n\nThe target range for the federal funds rate currently stands at 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent. Monetary policy remains in restrictive territory to support the sustainable return of inflation to our 2 percent goal. I expect it will be appropriate to continue to move to a more neutral policy setting over time.\n\nThe path for policy will depend on the data. If we’ve learned anything over the past five years, it’s that the outlook remains highly uncertain. Our decisions on future policy actions will continue to be made on a meeting-by-meeting basis. And they will be based on the totality of the data, the evolution of the economic outlook, and the risks to achieving our dual mandate goals.\n\nFrom what we know today, I expect real GDP growth to come in at about 2-1/2 percent for this year—or maybe a bit higher—reflecting solid supply-side growth. I anticipate the unemployment rate will run between 4 and 4-1/4 percent over coming months. And I expect inflation to be around 2-1/4 percent for the year as a whole. Looking ahead, I expect inflation to gradually come down to our 2 percent objective, although progress may be uneven at times.  \n\nThe Journey Continues\n\nThe word I’ve been using lately to describe the state of the economy is equipoise, which is a fancy way of saying equilibrium. And the journey to equipoise has been extraordinary.\n\nInflation that was once unacceptably high is now close to our 2 percent longer-run goal, and a labor market that was once exceptionally tight is now in balance. Our aim is to ensure that inflation continues its march toward 2 percent while sustaining the strength of the economy and labor market.\n\nWe’ve come a long way, and we’re committed to getting the job done."

            "content": "Introduction\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. It’s a pleasure to join you today. I’ll start by thanking you for your commitment to the economic development of communities across the New York region.\n\nMy remarks today will focus on the economic outlook in the United States and how the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy actions are helping restore price stability. I’ll also share some observations about economic developments closer to home in the New York metropolitan area. Before I go further, I need to give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s Mandate\n\nAt the Federal Reserve, our work and actions are guided by our dual mandate: to achieve maximum employment and price stability.\n\nWhen it comes to employment—the first half of the mandate—things are looking very good. The economy added nearly 2.9 million payroll jobs in 2023.1 The employment-to-population ratio of “prime-age” workers aged 25-54 has regained levels that prevailed in the months before the pandemic. And the national unemployment rate has been at or below 4 percent for two straight years now, the longest such stretch in over five decades. The current unemployment rate of 3.7 percent is in line with my 3-3/4 percent estimate for the unemployment rate that is likely to prevail over the longer run.\n\nOn the price stability side, the situation has improved significantly since the sharp rise in inflation that followed the onset of the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, surged to a 40-year high of about 7 percent in June of 2022. Over the past year and a half, the inflation rate has fallen back to just over 2-1/2 percent. This decrease is a clearly positive development, but it is important to stress that we still have a ways to go to get inflation back to the FOMC’s longer-run goal of 2 percent. Price stability is the bedrock upon which our economic prosperity stands and is essential to ensure maximum employment over the long term.\n\nThe Labor Market: U.S. and New York City\n\nI’ll now dive a bit deeper into the economic situation and outlook, starting with the employment side of our mandate. After the recovery from the pandemic, we saw a red-hot labor market take shape across the country. You’re familiar with the story—demand far exceeded supply, and that imbalance contributed to rapid wage growth and high inflation.\n\nOver the past year, even as the labor market has remained strong, we have seen a steady return toward better balance. Job growth ended the year on a strong note but has slowed considerably from the unsustainably high rates recorded in the first half of last year. Quits and hiring rates are back near pre-pandemic levels, as are the perceptions of job availability and the ability to fill jobs. The job openings rate—which reached all-time highs in 2022—has also trended lower but is still high relative to pre-pandemic norms.\n\nWe’ve seen a rebalancing in New York City as well, where the recovery in employment has taken longer than in the nation as a whole. Now, New York City has basically regained the jobs lost during the pandemic. Still, the recovery has been uneven. Even though employment in higher-wage sectors such as finance and business services has rebounded, sectors that tend to provide jobs to lower-wage workers that rely on foot traffic from office workers continue to lag, holding back the city’s recovery.\n\nThere have been meaningful improvements on the supply side of the labor market, too. Labor force participation has trended upward, and immigration rates have returned to pre-pandemic levels. But there are limits to how much supply can increase, and some further moderation in demand is likely needed to fully return balance to the labor market.\n\nThree Layers of Inflation\n\nI’ll now return to our price stability mandate. If you’ve read the speeches that I’ve given over the past year or so, you will know that I’ve been using a metaphor of an onion’s layers to explain inflation—how it climbed so high in 2021 and why it’s now moderating.2 In this metaphor, I describe three layers, so it’s become my “rule of three,” so to speak. Today, I’ll explain how each of the three layers represents a different sector of the economy.\n\nThe first and outermost layer of the inflation onion represents globally traded commodities. Demand for commodities soared when the pandemic hit, contributing to a surge in inflation, and then rose again when Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nNow that global demand has come into better balance with supply, commodity prices have come down significantly from their peak levels. Food price inflation has dropped below two percent, and energy prices have been falling over the past year, bringing down the overall inflation rate rather than pushing it higher.\n\nThe second layer of the onion—core goods, that is goods excluding food and energy—is also benefitting from the rebalancing of supply and demand, both here and abroad. The inflation rate in this layer of the onion has dropped to near zero, reflecting cooling demand and the resolution of supply chain bottlenecks that contributed to rapid price increases. The New York Fed’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index, which measures the extent of supply-chain disruptions, indicates that overall supply-chain pressures have returned to pre-pandemic levels.3\n\nWe’ve now peeled away the first two layers of the onion, which have seen the largest and most rapid improvements. We’re beginning to see significant progress in the third, innermost layer of the onion, too. Core services inflation has come down after peaking early last year. One factor contributing to this is slowing shelter inflation, as the growth of rents for newly signed leases returns to pre-pandemic norms. And the inflation rate for core services excluding housing has also slowed considerably.\n\nFuture Indicators\n\nWith that summary of the inflation onion in mind, what can we expect for inflation going forward?\n\nOne important factor behind inflation is inflation expectations, and the recent indicators here have been quite encouraging. Longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at levels consistent with the FOMC’s 2 percent goal. Medium-term inflation expectations are fully back to pre-pandemic levels. And one-year-ahead inflation expectations, which rose as inflation surged, have fallen dramatically to within the range seen in the seven years before the pandemic for which we have survey data.4\n\nA second useful indicator for future inflation is the New York Fed’s Multivariate Core Trend (MCT) inflation. After reaching nearly 5-1/2 percent in June of 2022, the most recent MCT reading is 2.3 percent.5 Other indicators of underlying inflation are showing significant declines toward pre-pandemic levels as well.\n\nThe third indicator I’ll mention—there’s my rule of three again—is wage growth. Economists at the New York Fed have developed a measure of trend wage inflation, which has declined to about 4-1/2 percent from its peak of near 7 percent in December 2021.6 This is another indicator that the labor market is coming back into better balance.\n\nIf we put all these pieces together, the data indicate that we are clearly moving in the right direction. However, we still are a ways from our price stability goal.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nSo, what does this mean for monetary policy?\n\nThe FOMC’s policy actions over the past two years have put in place a restrictive policy stance that is helping achieve balance between demand and supply and restore price stability. In December, the FOMC kept the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. In determining the extent of any additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.7\n\nSo here is my forecast for 2024 and beyond. Taking into account the effects of restrictive monetary policy, I expect GDP growth to slow to about 1-1/4 percent this year, and for the unemployment rate to rise to around 4 percent. I expect PCE inflation to continue to slow to about 2-1/4 percent this year, before reaching our 2 percent longer-run goal next year.\n\nAll of that said, the future remains uncertain. The risks are two-sided, with the possibility of supply-demand imbalances or inflation remaining stubbornly persistent weighed against that of a weaker-than-expected economy and labor market.\n\nMy base case is that the current restrictive stance of monetary policy will continue to restore balance and bring inflation back to our 2 percent longer-run goal. I expect that we will need to maintain a restrictive stance of policy for some time to fully achieve our goals, and it will only be appropriate to dial back the degree of policy restraint when we are confident that inflation is moving toward 2 percent on a sustained basis. The outlook remains highly uncertain, and I will continue to carefully watch and assess the data to judge whether the stance of policy is best positioned to achieve our goals. Our policy decisions will be made meeting by meeting and will follow another rule of three: by looking at the totality of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.\n\nI’d like to briefly mention the current state of the Fed’s balance sheet. At our last meeting in December, the FOMC said that it will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in our framework announced in 2022.8 The strategy and implementation of the reduction in our security holdings is working exactly as designed. Thus far we have reduced our securities holdings by about $1.3 trillion, with no signs of adverse effects on market functioning.9\n\nIn its plans, the FOMC said that to ensure a smooth transition it intends to slow and then stop the decline in the size of the balance sheet when reserve balances are somewhat above the level it judges to be consistent with ample reserves.10 So far, we don’t seem to be close to that point. The decline in securities holdings has been absorbed almost entirely by a drop in the overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility (ON RRP). As a result, aggregate reserve balances are little changed from their levels in mid-2022, when balance sheet reduction started. Looking ahead to this year, as the balance sheet continues to shrink and usage of the ON RRP continues to decline, we will closely monitor money market conditions and the demand for reserves.\n\nThe FOMC’s Commitment\n\nI’ll close with a final set of three. One, the strong actions that we have taken over the past two years are working as intended. Two, we have seen meaningful progress on restoring balance to the economy and bringing inflation down. And three, our work is not done. I am committed to achieving our 2 percent longer-run inflation goal and creating a strong foundation for our economic future."

            "content": "Albert Einstein famously said, \"Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.\" While charming advice to live by, it is also particularly salient when it comes to the rebalancing and movement taking place in the U.S. economy today.\n\nIn my remarks this evening, I'm going to discuss inflation, the continued imbalances between supply and demand, and the effects that monetary policy is having on different sectors of the economy. I'll share what this means for the economic outlook in the United States, and how the Federal Reserve's policy actions support our bedrock commitment to price stability.\n\nBefore I do that, I want to thank the Fixed Income Analysts Society for putting together this wonderful program. It's great to stay local, even if it means dodging rush hour traffic in Midtown. Although times like these make me wonder if I should take Einstein's bike riding advice more literally!\n\nI should also give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nInflation Indications and Implications\n\nI'll start by saying that although we are seeing some signs that inflation is moderating, it remains far too high, and it is my No. 1 concern going into 2023. Rapidly rising prices continue to have an immense impact on families and businesses, especially when it comes to essentials like food, utilities, and housing.\n\nHigh inflation is a new reality for many people. For the three decades preceding the pandemic, the inflation rate averaged almost exactly 2 percent, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index. But that changed dramatically in the spring of 2021, when inflation suddenly soared, ultimately reaching a 40-year high of 7 percent last June. While the inflation rate has since come down to 5-1/2 percent, it's still higher than any pre-pandemic reading since 1982 and far above the FOMC's 2 percent longer-run goal.\n\nPersistently high inflation undermines the ability of our economy to perform at its full potential, so it is critical for the Federal Reserve to bring inflation back down to our goal . We are firmly committed to doing so.\n\nShifts and Realignment\n\nThose who have been following my speeches lately will know that I've been quite devoted to a recurring theme: using the layers of an onion to describe inflation.1 But with the new year, I thought I would switch gears. I didn't have to look too far, because the mechanism of shifting gears is exactly what's going on in the economy. It also explains the effects that monetary policy is having on the economy and how that's helping to bring inflation back down.\n\nDuring the pandemic and its aftermath, we saw an enormous swing in demand, away from services like travel and entertainment and toward goods and housing, as people adjusted to work from home and avoided contact-intensive activities. More recently, we are seeing a rotation in demand from goods back into services. But through all these shifts, overall demand has remained very strong and has far exceeded supply.\n\nThis misalignment of supply and demand is true for the labor market as well. Although several indicators of labor demand—such as job openings, quits, and hiring—have stepped down from their very high levels of the first few months of 2022, they show that demand still far exceeds available supply. And the unemployment rate of 3.5 percent is historically low.\n\nThe same dynamics play out in the Federal Reserve's Second District, the region that the New York Fed represents. Our regional business surveys indicate that activity is slowing, with an especially sharp decline in the manufacturing sector. That said, many businesses continue to add staff, and consumer confidence is strong. Overall, inflationary pressures in the region are moving downward, but are still quite high.\n\nGears Are Turning\n\nWith inflation running persistently above its longer-run goal of 2 percent, the FOMC has taken strong actions to align demand with supply in the economy and bring inflation down. You can think of monetary policy as a large gear that is connected to smaller gears representing different sectors of the economy. But not all gears move at the same pace. Some turn more quickly, while others are slower, meaning they experience longer lags between policy actions and effects.\n\nThese effects of monetary policy are showing up in prices at different speeds. For example, the prices of globally traded commodities have already declined and are now well below levels we saw earlier last year. This reflects in part the effects of lower demand resulting from tighter monetary policy here and abroad.\n\nSimilarly, prices for many goods have started to plateau or even decline, reflecting weaker demand, lower import costs, and an easing of global supply disruptions that developed during the pandemic. For example, prices of used cars—a big driver of inflation during the first year of the pandemic—have been retreating toward more normal levels over the past few months. The combination of the general rotation of demand from goods to services and the effects of higher interest rates on demand for goods should contribute to further downward pressure on the prices of many goods this year.\n\nOne gear that is moving at a far slower pace is the price of non-energy services. The ongoing imbalance between supply and demand in this sector continues to contribute to inflationary pressures. But there is some good news on this front as well. One of the biggest drivers of the rise in inflation for services has been shelter costs, which soared as demand for housing increased during the pandemic. Recent data for newly-signed leases indicate that the tide is turning on rents, and we should see shelter cost inflation start to slow later this year. That said, inflation for other services besides shelter has remained high, and this gear is only starting to turn.\n\nInflation expectations represent another gear that is turning at an encouraging speed. Longer-run inflation expectations remain remarkably stable at levels consistent with 2 percent inflation.2 After rising moderately last year, households' three-year-ahead inflation expectations are now back to where they were in January 2021, and one-year-ahead inflation expectations have started to reverse the rise seen over the past year and a half.3\n\nThe FOMC's Policy Actions\n\nWith inflation still high and indications of continued supply-demand imbalances, it is clear that monetary policy still has more work to do to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal on a sustained basis.\n\nAt its meeting last month, the FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate to 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent, the seventh consecutive increase. The FOMC's December 2022 Summary of Economic Projections showed that a large majority of participants saw the federal funds rate reaching a level between 5 and 5-1/2 percent by the end of this year .\n\nThe FOMC statement indicated that \"the Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. In determining the pace of future increases in the target range, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.\"4\n\nBringing inflation down is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions. But restoring price stability is essential to achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer term, and it is critical that we stay the course until the job is done.\n\nI'll also add that the framework announced last May for reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet is working well, and the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities as planned.5\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nWe are seeing the shifting gears of tighter monetary policy having the desired effects. Broad indicators show that financial conditions have become significantly less supportive of spending. As a result, I expect real GDP growth to be modest this year at around 1 percent.\n\nRobust hiring, low unemployment, and strong nominal wage growth mean the labor market remains remarkably tight. But with growth slowing, I anticipate the unemployment rate to increase from its current level of 3-1/2 percent to around 4-1/2 percent over the next year.\n\nTurning to inflation, I expect cooling global demand and supply improvements to result in declining inflation for goods. These factors should contribute to inflation slowing further from its current rate to around 3 percent this year. While services inflation is still a sticking point, I expect overall inflation to come back down to 2 percent in the next few years as further tightening of monetary policy realigns the balance between demand and supply.\n\nConclusion\n\nI'll close by saying that the monetary policy gear is turning. But it will take time for supply and demand to come back into proper alignment and balance, so we must keep moving. While the route ahead is still uncertain, I am fully confident we will return to a sustained period of price stability."

            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and Happy New Year. Thank you, Charles, for that introduction. And thanks to Richard Haass for the opportunity to speak with the members of the Council on Foreign Relations once again.\n\nFor the past two years, I’ve begun my remarks by saying how much I wish we could meet together in person. This time, I really was hoping for a chance to rewrite the script. After seeing so much progress on vaccinations over the past year and a moderation in COVID-19 infections during the fall, just a short time ago many of us had expected that we’d soon be turning the page.\n\nThe story of the pandemic is a complicated one. It is writing itself as we live it, and the storyline has been far from predictable. This is, first and foremost, a health crisis. The unusual and extraordinary nature of the situation means that circumstances are constantly evolving.\n\nFor the economy, this has meant that what we’ve experienced is unlike any recession or recovery we’ve seen—or read about—in the past. While there have been significant improvements in the overall economy, setbacks persist in some areas, and new challenges have appeared.\n\nI’ll always take an opportunity to quote something from the Lord of the Rings canon, so I’ll continue with the story analogy and say that for many people, these past few weeks have felt like we’ve been “There and Back Again.”\n\nWe again find ourselves in a period of extraordinary difficulty. The emergence and rapid spread of the Omicron variant in the United States and around the world are resulting in new peaks of COVID infections and hospitalizations, as well as severe strains on the healthcare and essential services workforce. This is a reminder that the path of economic recovery continues to be driven by the course of the virus.\n\nIn my remarks this morning, I’ll share more about what we’re seeing in the incoming data and how it relates to the economic picture in the United States and the world more broadly. I’ll also highlight the significant progress we’ve seen in the labor market and my outlook for inflation. Finally, I’ll discuss the Federal Reserve’s recent policy actions and what they mean for the future.\n\nBefore I proceed, I need to give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nWhen I look at the economy, it is through the lens of the Federal Reserve’s “dual mandate.” These are two goals set by Congress: maximum employment and price stability. Given these goals, my focus is to study and understand the wide range of developments that affect employment, unemployment, and inflation as they play out in real time.\n\nAs we start a new year, it’s worth highlighting the key economic developments of last year, which were defined by a very strong recovery, both here and abroad. Although we don’t have all the data yet, I expect that U.S. inflation-adjusted, or real, gross domestic product (GDP) increased by about 5-1/2 percent last year, which would be the strongest growth rate between fourth quarters in over 35 years.\n\nThe economic snap-back here and abroad has led to global supply-chain bottlenecks and imbalances between supply and demand that have contributed to a sharp rise in inflation. Inflation in the United States, based on the personal consumption expenditures price index, will likely exceed 5 percent in 2021, and inflation rates are elevated in many other countries, too.\n\nLooking ahead, I expect the current Omicron wave to slow growth in the next few months as people once again pull back from contact-intensive activities. I also expect that the Omicron wave will temporarily prolong and intensify labor supply challenges and supply-chain bottlenecks that we have been experiencing. Current staffing challenges for essential service workers in the healthcare, transportation, and education sectors will likely have a ripple effect too. But, once the Omicron wave subsides, the economy should return to a solid growth trajectory and these supply constraints on the economy should ebb over time.\n\nConsidering the effects of Omicron on the economy in the first part of the year, I expect real GDP to increase around 3-½ percent this year. While this is not quite the blockbuster growth we saw in 2021, it is still well above its long-run trend and supportive of continued improvement in the labor market. Of course, experience has taught us not to be overly confident in predictions about COVID and its effects on the economy, and uncertainty around the economic outlook remains high.\n\nThe Labor Market\n\nNow I’ll turn to the employment side of our mandate, where the picture improved dramatically over the past year. About 6-1/2 million jobs were added last year, and the unemployment rate plummeted by 2.8 percentage points. In fact, with the unemployment rate now at 3.9 percent, we have retraced 96 percent of the COVID recession rise in less than two years. This is lightyears faster than the more than seven years it took for unemployment to retrace to the same degree after the global financial crisis. With the economy registering solid growth, I expect the unemployment rate will continue to come down further to 3-½ percent this year.\n\nThe strength in the labor market is seen in a wide variety of indicators, including job openings, quits, and wage growth. The labor market has been especially robust in recent months for workers at the bottom of the wage distribution. And female labor force participation and employment have improved, especially for women with young children.\n\nInflation and Supply-Chain Challenges\n\nOne of the foremost concerns surrounding the outlook is inflation, which rose considerably last year.\n\nThere are two main contributors to the current high inflation: very strong demand, especially for goods, and supply bottlenecks. Both have been prevalent throughout the pandemic. The shutdown of factories—particularly those in Asia—and widespread lockdowns led to disruptions to logistics networks, elevated shipping costs, and prolonged delivery times. A new index created by New York Fed research staff shows that global supply-chain pressures shot up last year, reaching historically high levels.1\n\nThese challenges are not just top of mind for companies selling their goods or consumers waiting for their purchases to be delivered. Elevated prices have real life consequences for so many, particularly for people who are struggling to cover the rising costs of food, housing, and transportation.\n\nThe circumstances we are facing today are unlike anything we’ve experienced in the past. Typical historical episodes cannot be used as reference points for current conditions. As an example, the very large increases in prices that we see today are primarily for durable goods. This is a striking turnaround from the past 25 years when those prices had been trending lower. In contrast, even with the recent increases, prices on services and non-durable goods are now fairly close to their longer-run trends. And, even though the Omicron wave is posing new obstacles, some supply issues are starting to work themselves out as the economy adjusts to the changing circumstances.\n\nJust as the pandemic has followed its own script, I anticipate that the dynamics of inflation will also be different than previous cycles. With growth slowing and supply constraints gradually being resolved, I expect inflation to drop to around 2-1/2 percent this year, much closer to the FOMC’s 2 percent longer-run goal. And looking further ahead, I expect inflation to get close to 2 percent in 2023.\n\nPolicy Actions\n\nThese developments in the labor market and for inflation inform the Federal Reserve’s policy response and recent actions. In its December 2021 statement, the FOMC said that it would keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent.2 With inflation having exceeded 2 percent for some time, the FOMC said it expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the FOMC’s assessments of maximum employment.\n\nBecause of inflation developments and the notable improvement in the labor market, the FOMC also decided to reduce the monthly pace of its net asset purchases.\n\nWith our actions, we have started the process of adjusting the stance of monetary policy away from one of providing maximum support for the economy. This movement in policy reflects the gains the economy has made since the beginning of the pandemic and the evolution of the risks to the achievement of our goals.\n\nThe next step in reducing monetary accommodation to the economy will be to gradually bring the target range for the federal funds rate from its current very-low level back to more normal levels. Given the clear signs of a very strong labor market, we are approaching a decision to get that process underway. The timing of such decisions will be based on a careful consideration of a wide range of data and information, with a clear eye on our maximum employment and price stability goals.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs we turn a page on the new year, it’s clear that we have not yet reached the end of this pandemic story. But despite the challenges, I am hopeful of a continued strong recovery this year."

            "content": "Hello, everyone. I'm really pleased to be joining your meeting today. Your work in bringing together leaders and visionaries in support of Black communities across our city is invaluable.\n\nWe're approaching the one-year mark since the pandemic took hold. At this time last year there was an increasing sense of fear and uncertainty about the future. And the events since then have posed tremendous challenges to families, communities, and the economy. The ongoing human toll is a tragedy we won't forget in our lifetimes.\n\nWhat has been an extraordinary public health crisis also has had profound consequences for the American and global economies. The cause of this recession—a global pandemic—means that our economic future will be determined in large part by the path of the virus and our collective success in overcoming it.\n\nWe still face many hurdles on the road to recovery from both COVID-19 and the severe economic hardship that has ensued. A lot depends on the success in quickly getting a large part of the public vaccinated against a backdrop of the spread of emerging new strains of the virus.\n\nDespite these challenges and uncertainties, I have become more optimistic about the medium-term outlook for the economy. I don't expect our lives to look like they did a year ago—our sense of \"normal\" may be forever altered—but with vaccinations well underway and a significant decline nationwide in confirmed new cases, I do expect that we can start to look toward a time that will be \"more like normal.\"\n\nIn my remarks today I'll set the scene for the economic picture locally, and for the U.S. economy as a whole. I'll also highlight some of the disparities we are seeing in the labor market. Finally, I'll share more about the Federal Reserve's response and how I view the path forward.\n\nBefore I continue, I need to give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nDual Mandate\n\nPrior to sharing the outlook, I think it's important to take a step back and explain some of the key factors that my colleagues and I at the Federal Reserve consider in reaching our policy decisions. The Fed has what we call a \"dual mandate,\" which are two goals set by Congress: maximum employment and price stability.\n\nWith these goals in mind, our focus is understanding developments that affect labor markets, inflation, and economic growth. But we also collect and analyze enormous amounts of other information, both in the form of data and reports from members of the communities we serve, to help us assess the state of the economy and inform our decision-making.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nI'll start off with the most common measure of the overall economy: gross domestic product, or GDP. I expect inflation-adjusted, or real, GDP to rebound sharply this year. Indeed, with strong federal fiscal support and continued progress on vaccination, GDP growth this year could be the strongest we've seen in decades. Such a robust rebound would be very welcome after the toughest period for the economy in living memory and a winter where the pandemic has been particularly severe.\n\nThe resurgence of COVID-19 over the past few months caused consumers to pull back on spending, resulting in significant job losses in some sectors—especially in leisure and hospitality. In past recessions, we have typically seen a decline in manufacturing jobs, while the service sector—establishments like hotels, bars, and restaurants—was not affected to the same extent. But the pandemic has flipped the script in that regard. Indeed, this time, both the manufacturing and housing sectors have rebounded sharply since last spring, while much of the service sector remains depressed.\n\nThe pandemic has had a truly devastating effect on employment. Overall, as of January of this year, we are down nearly 10 million jobs from the pre-pandemic level, a greater shortfall than we saw even at the worst point of the aftermath of the Great Recession.\n\nLocally, we've experienced considerable strain, given that much of New York City's economy hinges on the leisure and hospitality industry. Job losses have been dramatic: New York was hardest hit at the start of the pandemic, and almost a year later the data still show a city under stress. While national employment was 7 percent below pre-pandemic levels at the end of 2020, employment in New York City was 12 percent lower.1 I hope that as workers return to their offices and the weather turns warmer we will start to see people frequenting the small businesses that are the lifeblood of our city.\n\nUnfortunately, job losses have not been only highly concentrated in particular industries, but also more concentrated among certain demographic groups. The pandemic and the ensuing economic downturn have done disproportionate harm to women, communities of color, younger workers, and the lowest paid.2\n\nThe data are particularly sobering when we look at communities of color. Recent research by my colleagues at the New York Fed shows that more Black and Hispanic workers lost jobs compared to white workers, and Black workers have been more likely to drop out of the labor force entirely, making it more challenging to rejoin in the future.3 The Black-white unemployment gap, which had reached historical lows in 2019, widened considerably during the spring and summer, undoing much of the progress of the past decade. While the gap has narrowed some since, closing this gap further will be an important part of a full recovery.\n\nBlack-owned businesses have also suffered disproportionately.4 A report released by the New York Fed in August found that Black-owned businesses have been almost twice as likely to shutter during COVID-19 as white-owned firms.5\n\nA key area of our focus is to better understand what contributes to economic inequities and to finding solutions.6 Through our economic research and outreach efforts, we are working to understand how racial disparities play out in the labor market, and what can be done to change these outcomes.\n\nNow I'll turn to inflation, the other half of our dual mandate. Although we have seen swings in some prices from the effects of COVID, overall the inflation rate has been running below our 2 percent goal. With our economy and the global economy still far below full strength, I expect underlying inflationary pressures to remain subdued for some time. An encouraging sign is that measures of longer-run inflation expectations have retraced earlier declines as the economic outlook has brightened and are now at levels seen a few years ago. As the economy fully heals and reaches maximum employment over the next few years, I expect inflation will sustainably move to levels consistent with our 2 percent longer-run goal.\n\nThe Path Forward\n\nWhile the short-term outlook for the economy is highly uncertain, the longer-term picture is more favorable. With the ongoing vaccine rollout, more people will be able to travel, eat out, and shop in person safely.\n\nIn addition, the fiscal package enacted in December provides much-needed support to households and businesses until vaccinations are more widespread. Moreover, additional measures are currently being discussed in the Congress. Fiscal support, combined with highly favorable financial conditions and steady progress on vaccinations, are all reasons to be optimistic the economy will experience a strong recovery this year.\n\nBut the speed of the recovery will also depend on the global picture. We are seeing a slower rollout of immunizations in parts of Europe and a more subdued rebound in other parts of the world, which will have an effect on the United States. In addition, the emergence of new strains of the virus could slow the path to a post-COVID world.\n\nOur Response\n\nGiven all the factors I mentioned earlier, in January the FOMC decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at zero to ¼ percent. The FOMC stated that it expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with its assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.7 In addition, the Federal Reserve will continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage‑backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals.\n\nIn other words: Despite uncertainties, we are fully committed to supporting the economy through this period and reaching our maximum employment and price stability goals. We will continue to watch and learn and remain committed to using our full range of tools to help assure that the recovery will be as robust as possible.\n\nConclusion\n\nI'll conclude with this: Despite the progress so far in recovering from the recession, some of the numbers that I've shared are staggering. Families, businesses, and communities are struggling. Almost a year into the pandemic, there is still so much uncertainty.\n\nBut despite the near-term challenges, the longer-term outlook for the economy has improved, and our actions of the past year position monetary policy well to support a strong, full recovery and achievement of our goals of maximum employment and price stability. With this progress in mind, I am hopeful for a time soon that looks \"more like normal.\"\n\nThank you."

            "content": "Introduction\n\nGood afternoon, and happy new year.\n\nMonetary policy frameworks are complex, technical, and rarely make it into the public consciousness. But they are of vital importance to economic prosperity. And as we stand on the brink of a new decade, it is critically important that we understand how the frameworks central banks choose influence economic outcomes, both today and in the future.\n\nWhen Andy Haldane invited me to be on the panel, he posed the provocative question: What will monetary policy frameworks look like 30 years from now?\n\nAs a policymaker, I try to avoid making predictions for the future. But given that I will assuredly be an ex-central banker in the year 2050, I think I’m safe to have free rein!\n\nThat said, I should still give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIn my remarks today, I’ll discuss how the monetary policy landscape has evolved, and what that means for inflation targeting in 2020, 2050, and beyond.\n\nThe History of Inflation Targeting\n\nBefore I look forward, it’s worth looking back and highlighting that it’s now 30 years since the inception of inflation targeting.\n\nIn 1989, the central bank of the small country of New Zealand announced that the main objective of its monetary policy was to target the inflation rate.1 In the subsequent decades, most central banks in major economies coalesced around this approach of aiming for a low, publicly announced inflation rate.\n\nFor the past three decades, this approach has been remarkably successful at keeping inflation low and stable.2 The inflation targets have acted as a nominal anchor for inflation expectations, which play a big role in determining actual inflation.\n\nFor anyone who was trying to get a mortgage at a double-digit interest rate or seeing prices go up and up back in the days of high inflation, it’s almost unthinkable that in 2020 central banks are pondering the opposite challenge: how to prevent inflation from being too low.\n\nBut it’s the reality most policymakers face, and the one our monetary policy frameworks will need to grapple with long into the future.\n\nThe Future of Inflation\n\nSo, how did we arrive where we are today? Why is low inflation the current challenge, and why will that likely persist?\n\nTo answer these questions, we need to look at r-star, or the longer-run neutral rate of interest.\n\nOne estimate of r-star in the United States, from a model developed by Holston, Laubach, and myself, is around half a percent in the United States. That’s actually now lower than at any time before the Great Recession.3 We’ve seen similar declines in r-star in other advanced economies, including in Japan and the euro area.\n\nIn fact, the GDP-weighted average of estimates of r-star for Canada, the euro area, the United Kingdom, and the United States is now also half a percent, nearly 2 percentage points below where it stood at the turn of this century.4\n\nThese very low neutral rates are largely a result of global, longer-term structural factors. They’re driven by demographic changes, slow productivity growth, and demand for safe assets—all of which are unlikely to reverse any time soon.5\n\nOne key takeaway from these global trends is that interest rates and inflation are going to stay lower than we’ve come to expect in the past.6 This means that monetary policy will likely be more frequently constrained by the lower bound, or LB for short, creating a set of challenges for policymakers. In particular, life near the LB means central banks have much less room to maneuver using adjustments in short-term interest rates when faced with a downturn.\n\nThe Fundamentals of Inflation Targeting\n\nGiven that inflation targeting was designed in a world where inflation was undesirably high, does it still work for a world with the opposite problem?\n\nAs I peer into the future, the question is not so much what is wrong with inflation targeting, but rather what we need to preserve and, in fact, strengthen it. Any evolution of the current framework should involve doubling down on fundamental principles that have proven to be successful.\n\nWhat do I mean by that? There are three fundamental elements of inflation targeting that will be crucial as central banks work to prevent inflation from drifting too low: well-anchored inflation expectations, accountability, and transparency.\n\nInflation Expectations, Accountability, and Transparency\n\nThe most critical element is anchoring inflation expectations at the right level. For those of you who lived through the 1970s and 1980s, the specter of high inflation probably still looms large. But millennials and Generation Z have never faced the prospect of paying 15 percent on a mortgage.\n\nIt’s often claimed that we don’t really understand what drives inflation expectations. But, in fact, researchers have made significant progress on this topic. Research using a number of approaches has found that the history of inflation plays a big role in inflation expectations.\n\nNow, this does not mean that expectations are a mechanical average of past inflation, like in traditional versions of adaptive expectations. Instead, the key finding of this research is that inflation expectations depend on the historical behavior of inflation as shaped by the conduct of monetary policy.\n\nFor example, recent work using the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations shows a decline in longer-run inflation expectations by nearly half a percentage point over the last six years, to about 2-1/4 percent.7 This decline reflects both the low CPI inflation of recent years and demographic shifts, where members of older cohorts with high expectations (I’m afraid to say) die off.\n\nIf inflation continues to underrun target levels similar to the past six years, the downward trend in inflation expectations will likely continue. But there is still time to avert this fate—in this case, it’s fortunate that the young are impressionable. If inflation is sustained at target levels consistently, a further downward trend in expectations can be forestalled.\n\nBut expectations depend on deeds, not just words, which brings me to the issue of accountability. One reason inflation targeting has been so successful at keeping inflation low and stable is that policymakers held themselves accountable for consistently delivering low inflation near the target.\n\nFinally, as well as holding ourselves accountable, policymakers need to be transparent and communicate their actions and the rationale behind them. Much has been made about whether central banks can credibly commit to future actions and outcomes, but the experience with inflation targeting gives me encouragement. Inflation-targeting central banks have proved beyond a doubt that they could bring inflation down and keep it low and stable. This was not a foregone conclusion, and initially there were doubts about whether inflation targeting would succeed.\n\nIn addition, forward guidance delivered in the years following the financial crisis had a clear and direct effect on driving policy expectations and financial conditions. Keeping inflation expectations anchored at the right point will depend not just on policymakers holding themselves accountable for inflation, but on their ability to clearly execute and communicate their policies.\n\nConclusion\n\nI’ll finish with this. It’s risky to make predictions about the future. But in many ways the future is already here. Low r-star and declining inflation expectations are clear indicators of what’s to come. There’s been a great deal of discussion about how central banks around the world, and the Federal Reserve in particular, are going to deal with the challenges that lie ahead.\n\nAs the FOMC engages on its ongoing framework review, it is important to state again that any changes to our monetary policy framework must and will be carefully and thoughtfully considered. As long as we double down on the fundamentals of inflation targeting by anchoring inflation expectations at the target level, holding ourselves accountable to delivering on our objectives, and being transparent about our actions, we will be well positioned to handle whatever the future might bring.\n\nThank you."

            "content": "Introduction\n\nGood morning everyone. I wish every conference I went to had such an incredible opening—Joe’s certainly a hard act to follow. I have a son who’s a very talented artist, but he didn’t get those genes from me. So I’m going to stick to what I know—monetary policy.\n\nToday I’ll talk about the economy, how I’m assessing the outlook, and what that means for monetary policy. It’s early in the day, so I’ll try and keep the recitation of facts and figures to a minimum. But I know there are a lot of bankers in the room and that the direction of interest rates plays a vital role in your business, so, rest assured, I won’t skimp on that topic.\n\nGiven that I’ve promised to talk about interest rates, before I say another word I’ll give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Dual Mandate\n\nI want to start this morning by reminding everyone what the goals of the Federal Reserve are. It’s easy to think of the Fed as just setting interest rates, and of course that’s a major part of what we do. But we do so in order to achieve two goals set by Congress: maximum employment and price stability. In Fed-speak it’s called the dual mandate.\n\nThere are serious debates taking place amongst economists and policymakers about what maximum employment actually looks like, and they probably deserve another speech of their own. But I promised not to deluge you with numbers, so I’ll focus on a few highlights.\n\nThe unemployment rate last year averaged just under 4 percent, the lowest such annual figure since 1969. The latest jobs numbers also showed very strong growth, with over 2.6 million jobs added last year. The ongoing strength in the labor market has led to encouraging gains in wages. No matter how you cut it, the labor market is strong, consistent with our maximum employment goal.\n\nWhen we say price stability, our goal is to keep inflation around 2 percent.1 Those of you who are of my generation will remember the runaway inflation of the 1970s and early 1980s. Obviously that’s something we must avoid repeating. But the challenge of more recent years actually hasn’t been too high inflation. Instead, it’s been inflation that’s persistently too low. Over the past decade, inflation has more often than not come in below our goal.\n\nBut things are looking better. Underlying measures of inflation have been running just below 2 percent over the past 12 months, and I expect them to be right at 2 percent this year. And I don’t see any worrying signs of inflationary pressures building. So, from the perspective of the Fed’s dual mandate as a whole, things are looking very good.\n\nOf course, for this healthy jobs market and low and stable inflation to persist, we need solid growth in the economy. While GDP growth in 2018 looks to have been a robust 3 percent, we’re hearing anxiety both in the markets and the commentary, about what’s to come in 2019.\n\nI wish I could now tell you with certainty what will happen to the economy, but anyone who promises they can see into the future is a charlatan. However, what I can do is provide you with some insight into how I assess the health of the economy and what that means for my view on the monetary policy decisions before us.\n\nData Dependent\n\nI often say I’m data dependent, and I’ve talked about the major economic indicators, GDP growth, inflation, and employment. But these headline numbers aren’t the only things that inform my view on monetary policy, or the economy more broadly. I’m looking at a whole raft of information about what’s going on and where risks may be lurking.\n\nEmployment and unemployment numbers provide a useful summary measure of what’s happening in the labor market. But “data” doesn’t stop there. There are many sources of information on labor market conditions that I regularly consult. They range from very granular data that zero in on individuals’ experiences in the labor market, to indices of job openings, how many people are quitting their jobs, and labor market participation, to name a few.\n\nBut it’s not just these hard numbers that matter. I also find surveys of households and businesses provide valuable and timely perspectives about economic conditions. For example, there’s a questionnaire that asks people whether jobs are “hard to get.” It’s helpful because it gives the perceptions of normal people (and not economists!) about whether there are a lot of open positions. This survey continues to report that it’s relatively easy to find work, which is a very good sign about the strength of the economy.2\n\nBeyond the economic data and surveys, financial market indicators are a critical source of up-to-the minute information on how investors view the economy. In addition, stock prices and interest rates affect the spending decisions of households and businesses, and the value of the dollar affects demand for exports and imports, so these are important factors shaping the economy’s trajectory.\n\nMore broadly, I look at a wealth of data on international financial market developments and banking conditions, which feed into my understanding of the global outlook.\n\nFinally, and perhaps least well known, I spend a great deal of time speaking with members of the public, at our Board and Advisory Group meetings, community and business leader forums, and events like today’s. I get immense value from their insights, whether it’s the challenges they face in filling positions, their plans for capital investments, or how global developments are influencing their decisions. These discussions provide a huge amount of detail and texture to the economic picture. One of the great strengths of the Federal Reserve System is our extensive networks of contacts in our communities, and we share what we learn from these conversations when we meet at the FOMC.\n\nBeing \"data dependent\" means taking this holistic view when thinking about the economy and monetary policy. Not all of these types of data draw headlines the way shifts in the stock market do, but together they provide a much richer and more complete depiction of what’s happening. And they also tell me whether the signals we’re getting from the markets are reflected in the economy as a whole.\n\n2018 Tailwinds\n\nIn thinking about where the economy is heading, it’s worth reflecting on where we were 12 months ago.\n\nAt the start of last year the message I was getting—from business leaders, economic data, and the markets—was one of overwhelming positivity. This reflected three tailwinds: strong global growth, fiscal stimulus, and quite accommodative financial conditions. Each of these was giving the economy an extra boost. Indeed, these tailwinds provided even more of a boost over most of 2018 than forecasters had anticipated.\n\nFast forward 12 months and indicators in Europe and Asia point to less optimism about global growth. The initial lift from the fiscal stimulus will likely wane over the course of this year. And financial conditions have become less accommodative over the past several months. In addition, we are now seeing some emerging headwinds to growth from the partial government shutdown in the United States and elevated geopolitical uncertainties abroad.\n\nOther “data” confirm that the winds in our sails have calmed. The headlines have been about investors’ concerns around growth, which have contributed to volatility in markets. This is also showing through in surveys of households and businesses, who say that they are somewhat less confident about future economic prospects. For example, the latest Empire State Manufacturing Survey and New York Fed Business Leaders Survey both point to slowing growth in the region. And there is no doubt that my colleagues and I are hearing the same thing directly from our business and financial market contacts, who are more focused on the possibility of a weaker economic outlook this year.3\n\nBut let me be clear: a softer economic outlook doesn’t mean we should prepare for doom and gloom. On the contrary, it’s likely we’ll see GDP growth somewhere between 2 and 2½ percent this year. That’s a step down from 2018, but still consistent with a healthy, growing economy.\n\nSupporting a Strong Economy\n\nSo, how should the Fed respond to an outlook of slowing growth and one that’s less certain than, say, this time last year? In a word: carefully.\n\nAt the start of 2018, when the economy was growing well above trend and interest rates still were still quite low, gradually raising rates was the obvious and necessary choice. Twelve months later, the tailwinds have lost their gust, interest rates are closer to normal levels, and inflation is tame. The approach we need is one of prudence, patience, and good judgment. The motto of “data dependence” is more relevant than ever.\n\nIf growth continues to come in well above sustainable levels, somewhat higher interest rates may well be called for at some point. However, if conditions turn out to be less robust, then I will adjust my policy views accordingly.\n\nI assure you that I have my eyes wide open and my ear to the ground when it comes to thinking about how the economic outlook will unfold in the year ahead, and as ever I’ll be guided by the data in all its forms.\n\nThe Balance Sheet\n\nAside from my views on interest rates, the other issue I get asked about is the normalization of the balance sheet. When we first announced our plans in June 2017, I was poised to expound on them in great detail.4 But when I raised the topic I was sorely disappointed to be met with glazed eyes and general indifference. Sadly, nobody seemed to care!\n\nNow that’s changed, and I’m getting more interest on this topic.\n\nIt’s important to remember why the Fed took unconventional monetary policy actions in the first place. Large-scale asset purchases, forward guidance on the future path of interest rates, and seven years where the federal funds rate hovered close to zero, were all measures necessary for the full recovery from the Great Recession.\n\nA decade later and the FOMC has slowly but surely been moving monetary policy “back to normal.” We’ve moved interest rates closer to neutral, scaled back on forward guidance, and are over a year into the process of winding down the balance sheet.5\n\nOur goals throughout the policy normalization process have been twofold. First and foremost, to support a strong, sustainable expansion of the economy. Second, to do this in a predictable and transparent way that creates as little disruption as possible.6 So far, this plan has worked very well, with the economic expansion nearing record duration.\n\nBut it is important to stress that if circumstances change, I will reassess our choices regarding monetary policy, including the path of balance sheet normalization. Data dependence applies to all that we do. And, as always, if the outlook deteriorates in a material way, we stand prepared to deploy all our policy tools as appropriate in support of the economy.\n\nConclusion\n\nI’d like to conclude where I began, with the dual mandate. There’s sometimes a view that Fed policymakers are fixated on two data points: inflation and employment. And the reason is that’s how we’re judged by Congress at doing our job.\n\nBut underpinning these is a strong economy, and ultimately that’s what we’re always using monetary policy to support. So, as the year unfolds I’ve got my eyes wide open, looking at the data and listening to experience—whether it’s coming from household surveys, market indicators, or from leaders in my District.\n\nThe economy is strong, the outlook is healthy, and my number one priority is using monetary policy to keep it that way. In short, I’m watching, listening, and prepared to adjust my views depending on the data."

            "content": "Good afternoon.  It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak with you at this event.  Today, I will focus on the economic outlook for 2018 and beyond.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nBroadly speaking, the prospects for continued economic expansion in 2018 look reasonably bright.  The economy is likely to continue to grow at an above-trend pace, which should lead to a tighter labor market and faster wage growth.  Under such conditions, I would expect the inflation rate to drift higher toward the FOMC’s 2 percent long-run objective.\n\nOver the longer term, however, I am considerably more cautious about the economic outlook.  Keeping the economy on a sustainable path may become more challenging.  While the recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 likely will provide additional support to growth over the near term, it will come at a cost.  After all, there is no such thing as a free lunch.  The legislation will increase the nation’s longer-term fiscal burden, which is already facing other pressures, such as higher debt service costs and entitlement spending as the baby-boom generation retires.  While this does not seem to be a great concern to market participants today, the current fiscal path is unsustainable.  In the long run, ignoring the budget math risks driving up longer-term interest rates, crowding out private sector investment and diminishing the country’s creditworthiness.  These dynamics could counteract any favorable direct effects the tax package might have on capital spending and potential output.\n\nFavorable Near-term Outlook\n\nTurning to the near-term outlook, the prospects appear favorable for another year of above-trend growth.  Consumer spending should continue to grow at a moderate pace, supported by solid fundamentals.  Household income is being bolstered by faster compensation growth and continued healthy employment gains.  Moreover, the aggregate household balance sheet remains in good shape, due in part to rising home prices, a strong stock market, and only moderate growth in household debt.  Over the past year, home prices have risen by about 7 percent on a national basis, and the S&P 500 equity index has risen by nearly 20 percent.  In contrast, household debt has risen about 4 percent over the past year, only slightly higher than the growth in personal income.  Further, the household debt service burden is low, reflecting the extended period of low interest rates.\n\nOf course, the aggregate figures mask some underlying problems.  Two issues worth highlighting are the persistent growth in income and wealth inequality and the burden of rising student loan debt.2  Many people of more modest means don’t directly benefit from rising home and stock prices.  And, increasing student debt burdens have made it more difficult for many young adults to become homeowners.3  This is significant because homeownership is a major avenue for wealth accumulation for many households.  Nevertheless, the tightening labor market should provide greater opportunities for workers to obtain employment, build human capital, and gain greater opportunities to improve their financial circumstances.\n\nOn the business side of the ledger, investment spending should remain solid.  Business cash flows are strong, and the corporate sector is set to receive a meaningful lift from the recently enacted tax legislation.  The large reduction in the statutory corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and the 100 percent expensing provision for investment should drive down the effective cost of capital for business. \n\nIn addition, the U.S. economy should be well supported by the recent improvement in the global economic outlook.  More synchronized cyclical recoveries in Europe and Japan—and a revival of growth in many emerging market economies—should ensure that demand for U.S. goods and services remains strong. \n\nPutting it all together, I have raised my real GDP forecast for 2018 by about half a percentage point to three quarters of a percentage point to a 2½ percent to 2¾ percent range.  About one-third of this upward revision reflects the firmer momentum of the economy going into 2018 and about two-thirds the stimulative impact of the tax legislation. \n\nWhile this legislation will reduce federal revenues by about 1 percent of GDP in both 2018 and 2019, I anticipate the boost to economic growth will be less than that. Most importantly, most of the tax cuts accrue to the corporate sector and to higher-income households that have a relatively low marginal propensity to consume.  This suggests that a significant portion of the tax cuts will be saved, not spent. \n\nOn the business side, the boost to investment from the lower corporate tax rate and full expensing is likely to be relatively modest.  In the past, aggregate investment spending has not been very sensitive to the cost of capital, which is only one of many factors that influence investment spending.4  Moreover, the reduction in the effective tax rate for corporations—or what they typically pay in practice—is only about 3 to 4 percentage points, far smaller than the reduction in the statutory rate.  On the household side, the impact is likely to be attenuated by the temporary nature of many important provisions.  Households may not spend much of the additional after-tax income if they perceive the gains as likely to be transitory. \n\nFinally, the legislation is likely to generate some frictional costs that will mitigate its effects on growth.  In particular, it likely will have disparate impacts regionally and across economic sectors.  For example, the $10,000 cap on the amount of state and local income and property taxes that can be deducted will raise the effective cost of owning higher-end residential property in high-tax states.  This could adversely affect prices and construction activity of high-end housing in such states. \n\nIf the economy continues to grow at an above-trend pace in 2018, the labor market should tighten further.  In fact, I anticipate that the civilian unemployment rate will fall below 4 percent this year and reach the lowest level since at least 2000.  If this scenario proves accurate, this should lead to further firming of wage growth. \n\nOn this point, some wonder whether the relationship between tight labor markets and higher inflation has broken down.  I have not lost faith in this relationship.  As the labor market has tightened over the past few years, we have seen a discernible firming in the wage inflation trend from 2 percent to around 2½ percent.5  Also, data at the state level indicate that states with lower unemployment rates tend to have firmer wage trends.  This supports the case that tighter labor markets tend to be associated with higher wage growth. \n\nAs the labor market tightens and wage growth firms further, I would expect these conditions to push up price inflation, particularly for services.  Research by the New York Fed has found that prices of manufactured goods do not appear to be sensitive to labor market tightness.6  In contrast, tighter labor markets tend to be associated with higher price inflation for services.  This difference presumably reflects several factors.  First, prices of manufactured goods are determined in global markets, whereas prices for most services are determined locally.  Second, there remains significant excess capacity in manufacturing across much of the world.  In the United States, for example, the manufacturing capacity utilization rate was only 76.4 percent in November, about 2 percentage points below its average since 1972.  Third, for manufactured goods, there may be more scope for substituting capital for labor, and/or lowering labor costs by importing labor-intensive intermediate goods.  To the extent that this margin of adjustment is available, it would tend to dampen the impact of higher wage costs on prices of manufactured goods.  Finally, the so-called “Amazon” effect, which results in greater price transparency for buyers, may weigh disproportionately on goods prices. \n\nAlthough inflation remains somewhat below the FOMC’s 2 percent objective on a year-over-year basis, I still anticipate that it will stabilize around that level over the medium term.  As I noted earlier, above-trend growth should tighten the labor market further, pushing up wage inflation and eventually services prices.  In fact, we have already seen some increase in inflation in recent months.  Over the three months ending with November, core personal consumption expenditure prices rose at a 1.8 percent annual rate, up from a corresponding rate of just 0.4 percent last May.  The pronounced slowing of core inflation during the first half of 2017 was due, in part, to transitory factors, such as a sharp fall in prices for cellular phone services.  Those influences have been temporarily depressing the year-over-year figures. \n\nWhen these transitory influences drop out of the year-over-year numbers this spring, the inflation rate is likely to move higher.  Importantly, even as inflation undershot the FOMC’s objective over the past year, inflation expectations have been broadly stable.  I would be much more concerned if low inflation outcomes were contributing to a decline in inflation expectations.  That would make it more difficult to push inflation back toward our 2 percent objective and would increase the risk of getting stuck at the effective lower bound for interest rates following the next economic downturn, which inevitably will come. \n\nEven if inflation were to remain somewhat below 2 percent over the near future, that might not be a serious problem, if the economy were to continue to perform well in other respects.  To me, it would imply that the unemployment rate associated with “maximum employment” is lower than current estimates and that we could let the labor market tighten a bit further.  This would be a positive outcome because the productive capacity of the U.S. economy would be enhanced and more people would be able to find jobs, develop their job skills, and build their human capital. \n\nIn short, 2018 looks like it will be a good year for the economy.  I anticipate that the Federal Reserve will make further progress in achieving its dual mandate objectives of maximum sustainable employment and price stability.  If circumstances evolve close to what I have outlined today, I will continue to advocate for gradually removing monetary policy accommodation.  As I see it, the case for doing so remains strong.  While the fact that inflation is below the FOMC’s 2 percent objective argues for patience, I think that is more than offset by an outlook of above-trend growth, driven by accommodative monetary policy and financial conditions as well as an increasingly expansionary fiscal policy. \n\nMoreover, if the labor market were to tighten much further, there would be a greater risk that inflation could rise substantially above our objective.  But, let me be clear: A small and transitory overshoot of 2 percent inflation would not be a problem.  Were it to occur, it would demonstrate that our inflation target is symmetric, and it would help keep inflation expectations well-anchored around our longer-run objective.  In contrast, if inflation were to shoot appreciably above 2 percent for a considerable time, the FOMC would have to adopt a markedly tighter policy stance that would put the economic expansion at risk.  In such circumstances, it is unlikely that we would be able to sustain a low level of unemployment and also achieve our inflation objective.\n\nPotential Concerns for the Longer-term Outlook\n\nSo, if 2018 looks good, what about the longer term?  Let me start by discussing what I’m not worried about, before turning to those areas where I have greater concerns.  For one, I do not think the economic expansion—now in its ninth year—is vulnerable just because it is “old.”  As we like to say, expansions don’t die of old age—they die either because monetary policy needs to be tightened appreciably to combat rising inflation, or because the economy gets hit with a large shock that overwhelms the ability of the Federal Reserve and other policymakers to stabilize it successfully.  In general, with inflation below the FOMC’s long-run objective we can be cautious in how we adjust monetary policy. \n\nSimilarly, I am not concerned about the recent flattening of the Treasury yield curve even though some commentators believe that such a flattening foreshadows a recession.  At the end of 2017, the spread between the 10-year Treasury bond and 2-year Treasury note had narrowed to 52 basis points, from 125 basis points at the start of the year.  As I see it, some flattening in the yield curve should be expected as we gradually remove monetary policy accommodation.  If the yield curve were not flattening, it would suggest that we were behind the curve in removing accommodation.  Moreover, this recent flattening is not particularly pronounced.  For example, the 10-year/2-year spread of 52 basis points is only 46 basis points narrower than the average since 1978. \n\nIn addition, all else equal, we should expect the yield curve to be flatter than normal in the current environment.  Not only are bond term premia depressed due to quantitative easing both here and abroad, but the low inflation environment is also likely a contributing factor.  If investors perceive that the risk of significantly higher inflation has fallen over time as inflation has persistently undershot 2 percent, they should demand lower bond term premia as compensation for inflation risk.  Finally, while inverted yield curves have typically preceded recessions, I am unaware of any causal element in that relationship.  For example, I don’t believe that banks become unwilling to lend when the yield curve inverts and that this tightening of credit availability “causes” a recession.  I think it is noteworthy that in the current environment, higher short-term interest rates tend to raise—not lower—the banking industry’s profitability.  This is demonstrated, in part, by the strong performance of bank stocks in 2017 as the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates.\n\nAs I see it, the Treasury yield curve becomes inverted when investors believe that short-term real interest rates are high and monetary policy is tight.  Investors anticipate that such a regime will slow the economy and be followed by a reduction in short-term rates.  Because these expectations turn out to be validated eventually, we observe that inverted yield curves precede and signal recessions.  But, we are not in this situation currently. Investors expect short-term interest rates to rise, not drop, and to remain higher in the future than they are now.  Despite the flatter yield curve, the consensus view continues to be that monetary policy is not yet tight. \n\nOne area I might be slightly—but not particularly—worried about is financial market asset valuations, which I would characterize as elevated.  While valuations are noteworthy, I am less concerned than I might be otherwise because the economy’s performance and outlook seem consistent with what we see in financial markets.  Volatility in the real economy has been low, and this has been matched by low volatility in financial markets, which has helped support high valuations.  I am also less worried because the financial system today is much more resilient and robust than it was a decade ago.  Thus, even if financial asset prices were to decline significantly—which presumably would occur if the economic outlook were to deteriorate—I don’t think such declines would have the destructive impact we saw a decade ago.  Higher capital and liquidity requirements for major banks have made the banking system more resilient and better able to absorb market shocks without this impairing its ability to intermediate credit flows between borrowers and savers.  It was the collapse of confidence in the financial system in 2008 that caused credit availability to dry up, contributing greatly to the severity of the Great Recession.7 \n\nSo, what am I worried about?  Two macroeconomic concerns warrant mention.  The first is the risk of economic overheating.  Now, this seems like an odd issue to focus on when inflation is low, but it strikes me that this is a real risk over the next few years.  Not only do we have an economy that is growing at an above-trend pace—at a time when the labor market is already quite tight—but the economy will be getting an extra boost in 2018 and 2019 from the recently enacted tax legislation.  Moreover, even though the FOMC has raised its target range for the federal funds rate by 125 basis points over the past two years, financial conditions today are easier than when we started to remove monetary policy accommodation. \n\nThis suggests that the Federal Reserve may have to press harder on the brakes at some point over the next few years.  If that happens, the risk of a hard landing will increase.  Historically, the Federal Reserve has found it difficult to achieve a soft landing—especially when the unemployment rate has fallen below the rate consistent with stable inflation.  In those circumstances, the Federal Reserve has been unable to both push up the unemployment rate slightly to a level that is consistent with stable inflation and avoid recession.8  Now, I don’t want to imply that a recession is inevitable once the FOMC finds it necessary to nudge up the unemployment rate to a sustainable level.  The starting point in terms of the inflation rate is also important because it will influence how far the FOMC is likely to go in terms of making monetary policy tight.  Nevertheless, I think it is fair to say that the track record on this score is not encouraging.\n\nThe second risk is the long-term fiscal position of the United States.  Recognizing that fiscal policy is the domain of the executive and legislative branches rather than the Federal Reserve, I would emphasize several points.  For one, the current U.S. fiscal position is far worse than it was at the end of the last business cycle.  For example, in fiscal year 2007, the budget deficit was 1.1 percent of GDP; in fiscal 2017, it was 3.5 percent of GDP.  Similarly, federal debt held by the public was 35 percent of GDP in fiscal 2007, and 77 percent in fiscal 2017.  Additionally, three factors will undoubtedly cause these budgetary pressures to intensify over time: the tax legislation will push up the federal deficit and federal debt burden; debt service costs will rise as interest rates normalize; and entitlement outlays will increase as the baby boom generation retires.  Let me discuss each of these in turn. \n\nWith respect to the tax legislation, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the cost at around $1.1 trillion over the next 10 years.9  This estimate takes into consideration the likelihood that the legislation will boost the productive capacity of the U.S. economy somewhat—raising the economy’s potential growth rate—and that this incremental growth will generate additional tax revenues.  To me, this seems like a reasonable estimate, recognizing that with any complex tax legislation, there is a high level of uncertainty about its impact on longer-term growth and revenues.  It is possible that the boost to the nation’s productive capacity from higher capital spending and greater labor supply will be higher than anticipated, leading to faster growth and greater revenue.  But, on the other side, the revenue projections might also turn out to be overly optimistic as households and businesses react to changes in the tax code by adjusting how they conduct their activities in a way to minimize their tax liabilities.  This might especially be true as people look to take advantage of the lower top marginal pass-through rate that is available on sole proprietorships, partnerships, LLCs and S corporations compared to wage income. \n\nDebt service costs will undoubtedly be boosted by higher levels of federal debt and higher interest rates.  In fiscal year 2007, federal debt service costs totaled $237 billion on $5 trillion of federal debt held by the public.  By fiscal year 2017, although federal debt held by the public had nearly tripled to almost $15 trillion, debt service costs were $263 billion, only modestly above where they were 10 years earlier.  Over the past decade, the sharp decline in short- and long-term interest rates has kept a lid on debt service costs—that lid is now being lifted. \n\nAlthough the future path of interest rates is highly uncertain, the most recent 10-year projections of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) illustrate where debt service costs are heading.  For example, the CBO projects that debt service costs in 2027 will be more than $800 billion—nearly 3 percent of GDP, more than double their current share.10\n\nFinally, the retirement of the baby boom generation over the next decade will put considerable pressure on outlays.  The CBO projects that, by 2027, outlays on Social Security and Medicare will rise to 6 percent and 5 percent of GDP, respectively—each more than a percentage point higher than in 2017. \n\nAs the economist Herbert Stein once remarked, trends that are unsustainable must end.  How, precisely, the United States chooses to address its fiscal challenges will have important consequences for the economy, monetary policy, and financial markets in the years ahead. \n\nTo sum up, I am optimistic about the near-term economic outlook and the likelihood that the FOMC will be able to make progress this year in pushing inflation up toward its 2 percent objective.  The economy has considerable forward momentum, monetary policy is still accommodative, financial conditions are easy, and fiscal policy is set to provide a boost.  But, there are some significant storm clouds over the longer term.  If the labor market tightens much further, it will be harder to slow the economy to a sustainable pace, avoiding overheating and an eventual economic downturn.  Another important issue is the need to get the country’s fiscal house in order for the long run.  The longer that task is deferred, the greater the risk for financial markets and the economy, and the harder it will be for the Federal Reserve to keep the economy on an even keel.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions."

            "content": "I very much appreciate having the opportunity to participate in today’s program. Improving the culture of financial services is an important issue for me and my colleagues at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as well as for many senior policymakers both domestically and abroad. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nWhy should we seek better culture in the financial services industry? We do this to achieve better outcomes in terms of conduct and behavior—and, with that, greater trustworthiness in our nation’s financial system. Greater trustworthiness will make it easier for the financial industry to perform its role in supporting economic activity and rising living standards. Greater trustworthiness will also make it easier to attract top talent into the industry. Without that, the industry will suffer.\n\nThe focus of today’s event is the role you can play as future leaders of the industry. Your firms selected you to attend because of your career success thus far and your potential for senior leadership. It is timely, therefore, for you to consider what type of leader you want to be, what type of firm you want to lead, and what type of industry you want to work in and influence. I have some views on all three, which we will get to in a moment.\n\nI am encouraged that members of the industry have convened here today to engage on these issues. I think it is important that the industry tackle this together. You can learn from one another. And, given the scandals of recent years, you really do have to sink or swim together.\n\nBefore the recent spate of conduct problems, there were times when one might be secretly happy when a competitor stumbled through some sort of misconduct. All the better if such a stumble generated negative publicity and headlines. Today, the situation is vastly different. When each new scandal emerges, the industry is painted with the same broad brush. This underscores the importance of taking both individual and collective responsibility for reform. You have a personal stake in improving bank culture. Your firms have a stake too. And so does the industry.\n\nThere are three messages I am going to focus on today:\n\nFirst, stay in banking and be good role models of the behaviors and conduct that we all want to see. It’s important. The banking industry needs your talents. And, if done the right way, it will result in a fulfilling career.\n\nSecond, banking does not have its own ethics—nor should it have its own ethics. The qualities that you value in other aspects of your life should be the same qualities you apply at work and encourage in your colleagues.\n\nThird, candid assessment is critical to improving culture. I invite you to think in particular about the incentives and norms of behavior within your organizations. Do they support or impair the qualities and principles that guide you and that your firm espouses?\n\nBefore expanding on those points, let me explain why I believe that reforming culture is important, and justifies the time and effort of not only of today’s program, but of the ongoing work at your institutions and collectively across the industry.\n\nThe manipulations of LIBOR and foreign exchange rates prompted the New York Fed’s work on culture. Of course, widespread misconduct did not originate with either episode. The timing, however, was significant. Despite the near-death experience of the financial crisis, new rules and regulations, and―in some cases―large fines and penalties, the LIBOR and FX events made clear that serious ethical and behavioral problems had persisted in the industry. I was particularly struck by how the manipulation of foreign exchange rates occurred even after the LIBOR fixing was widely known. The appropriate lessons from the LIBOR scandal did not seem to have been learned. That was both surprising and profoundly disappointing to me.\n\nThe LIBOR and FX collusions were not occasional atonalities in an otherwise harmonious financial system. They were not two remote tail risks that both happened to materialize, or just a bad coincidence. There have been too many examples of other misconduct to list. Wells Fargo is the most recent example, but serious misconduct is not confined to a single jurisdiction or a business model. The evidence, which now stretches over a decade, has only reaffirmed my initial belief that there is an industry-wide problem.\n\nIn light of these continuing and widespread failures, my colleagues and I recognize the importance of culture—that is the unwritten norms and accepted practices of an organization. The culture of each firm will necessarily be its own. But the pervasiveness of problems—across firms and countries—points to common, industry-wide norms that need attention.\n\nAn industry-wide problem needs an industry-wide solution. I also think that, when the problem is cultural, any solution must be industry-driven. It is the public sector’s job to establish and enforce rules, but rules face some inherent limits in shaping conduct and behavior. It is natural to adapt to the behaviors that we observe around us. A common illustration of this point is the speed limit. Most drivers move with the flow of traffic. They pay less attention to a number posted on a sign.\n\nThis is not to deny the necessity and importance of regulation, or to criticize any of the particular rules imposed in response to the financial crisis. But, we also must recognize that it is impossible to create a rule for every situation. Also, rules tend to be reactive rather than proactive. Rulemakers—whether they be members of Congress, regulators or judges—are almost always responding to events. And, even if rules could cover every situation, having a rule does not mean that people will always follow it. In many recent examples, the behaviors we observed violated rules already on the books. Thus, more rules and penalties alone will not cure the industry’s underlying problems. They are necessary, but not sufficient.\n\nWhat’s more, establishment of too many brightline rules may prove counterproductive in encouraging a good culture. For one thing, intricate and detailed rules can be construed as implying that the responsibility for good conduct rests with supervisors and regulators. For another, rules may create opportunities or incentives for legal or regulatory arbitrage—finding creative ways around rules. And this activity may, in itself, have insidious effects on culture.\n\nAs I see it, the problem occurs when an organization’s culture equates “what is right” with what is legally permissible, and when “what is wrong” becomes equivalent to what is legally impermissible. The technical legality of the rule, not the propriety of our conduct, becomes the arbiter of our actions. A proliferation of rules may prompt us to ask first what we can do, not what we should do. Legal arbitrage is intellectually energetic, but ethically lazy.\n\nAnd, as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara has observed, if you spend your time thinking about how close to the line you can get, it is inevitable that you will at some point cross that line. No one gets the arbitrage right 100 percent of the time.2 When you make that mistake, you will not only have a bad culture, but you will also have to deal with Preet Bharara’s office.\n\nTherefore, what’s needed is a better culture. Culture can help to fill in the spaces between and beyond rules. Culture also shapes our attitude toward rules. A strong, ethical culture is one in which individuals within an organization demonstrate to each other a commitment to certain first principles. These principles must align with both the private purpose of the organization and the public rules governing its operations.\n\nOf course, it is possible for principles to conflict. When that occurs, determining the right course will be difficult. But, the more you wrestle with that conflict, the better you will become at resolving ethical quandaries. Aristotle called this aspect of ethics “habit,” but I prefer to think of it as ethical muscle memory. The more practice you have in thinking about it, the better you will be at determining what is right.\n\nBankers will be more likely to think about what is right, as opposed to what is merely legal, the more often they observe their colleagues doing the same. I doubt that rules alone can accomplish this. Telling people to be ethical doesn’t make it so. Seeing others engage in ethical decision-making is, by contrast, quite powerful.\n\nWith that prologue, let me turn to my first message: Stay in banking. This might be a surprising message in light of my introduction. Nonetheless, banking is important work. Society relies on its financial system to “create substantial value for our society.”3 As investor and author John Bogle has written:\n\nTo fulfill its potential for creating value for society, the financial system needs talented and dedicated people at the helm. This is especially true for banks, which are indispensable to our economic system.\n\nAs the philosopher Onora O’Neill has observed, banking requires more than just technical competence.5 Bankers must reproduce their efforts and results with reliability. And, above all, bankers must be honest. They must do what they say and say what they mean. This is necessary for the financial system to be viewed as trustworthy. Without that, the financial industry cannot be effective in performing its key roles.\n\nCultivating these three traits emphasized by Onora O’Neill—competence, reliability and honesty—will help enable you to have a personally fulfilling career. The best doctors or lawyers do their work not only because it pays well, but because it is interesting and contributes an important service to society. I hope you feel the same about what you do. And if you don’t, I urge you to consider how your industry can become more professionally fulfilling. What is needed for you to feel better about your work, to sleep more soundly, to worry less about the risk posed to your business by potential misconduct?\n\nYour professional fulfillment will grow if you also contribute to promoting these qualities in others—that is, by helping to improve the culture of financial services. It is easier to be smart, dependable and trustworthy when you are surrounded by other people who also fit that description.\n\nMy second message is to reject the idea that a separate regime of ethics or morality applies in banking. I’m sure you have heard this, or perhaps even thought this, at some point in your career. Let it end there. We often teach our children by asking them if they would engage in that type of behavior at home. This is good professional advice as well.\n\nBankers have been criticized for their ethical and moral shortcomings. That criticism has legitimate grievances at its roots. There have been far too many instances in which bankers have not lived up to expectations. But it is also true—and I’m sure you have experienced this—that you have advanced in your careers because you have demonstrated personal attributes that anyone would be proud to possess. I mentioned before honesty, competence and reliability. You could add to that list hard work, perseverance and responsiveness.\n\nMoreover, if you are like me, your careers will have benefitted from teamwork—the good fortune to work with capable colleagues. Individual effort is essential, but success often depends as well on the contributions of others.6 Whatever list you have come up with, make sure that teamwork is among your core personal principles.\n\nI would also like to make a slightly different observation on banker ethics. What’s missing is not so much a personal commitment to good conduct, but rather a commitment to call out bad conduct observed in others. You might think it is a paradox or a contradiction to praise teamwork in one breath, and then in the next breath to call for raising the red flag when you see bad conduct in others. I do not see it that way.\n\nWe hear often that integrity is a corporate value. I think what is often meant by this is honesty—doing what you say, and saying what you mean. But integrity, to me, has an additional meaning. It means operating according to a single, internally consistent set of principles. If you are honest only in some places or circumstances, but not others—or only with some people, but not others—then honesty is hardly integral or integrated into your life and work.\n\nThe importance of this particular meaning of “integrity” was made apparent to me on a recent visit I made to the United States Military Academy at West Point. The faculty and students there believe that strong individual ethics are what make large organizations like the U.S. armed forces succeed. The commitment of cadets to living the ideals of the institution was impressive and humbling. They embodied the word integrity—alignment of word and deed in all aspects of life.\n\nAnother lesson that I took from West Point is that cadets commit to integrity because their careers—and, in combat, their lives—depend on others. We are in this together—this city, this industry, this country. And if we’re in it together, we all have to behave in ways that benefit the group.7 We have to behave in ways that merit the trust of others.\n\nWhether we are citizens or soldiers, the most important relationships in our lives are built on trust. In our personal lives, we take action when our trust has been betrayed. To reform financial services, we need to bring the same expectations of trust—and the consequences of a breach of that trust—to the office each day. If you would not tolerate a practice in your personal life, do not tolerate it in the office.\n\nCalling out bad conduct is not easy. Let me share with you another observation from Preet Bharara. A common element in many of the frauds his office has prosecuted is the failure of colleagues to call out bad conduct by raising their hands. This is so telling of a culture that condones or promotes misconduct. People see something, but do not say something. And, it is so shortsighted. It prevents problems from being addressed while they are small. By not raising their hands, these colleagues are “quietly adding risk to your books [and] invisibly enlarging your liabilities.”8 They are also tacitly encouraging bad conduct by skewing incentives.\n\nThere may be many reasons for choosing silence over raising your hand. You may face a conflict of loyalties. It’s uncomfortable to tell on a colleague. You may think that the problem will just go away, or that calling attention to a problem will harm the firm. Raising your hand is difficult. But, it is also absolutely necessary. As rising leaders in the industry, you need to lead by example. In doing so, you will make it easier for others to follow your lead.\n\nMy final message is a request that each of you commit to a candid assessment of yourselves, your firms and your industry. For Adam Smith, candid observation was a cornerstone of economic behavior:\n\nCandid self-assessment is essential to knowing where you stand and how you are progressing toward your goal. Industry groups here and in other financial centers are working on useful ways to measure culture—consistent with the maxim, “if it’s important, you will measure it.” But, assessment cannot stop there, and it cannot be the job of someone else—such as management, compliance, audit or a regulator. Each of us must also be reflective about our own faults. We must also commit to do better going forward.\n\nWhen it comes to making a candid assessment of your group, your firm and your industry, I would like to suggest that you devote significant attention to incentives. I believe that incentives shape behavior, and behavior drives culture. If you want a culture that will support your long-term business strategy, you need to align incentives with the behaviors that will sustain your business over the long haul.\n\nThere are many ways of encouraging certain behavior through incentives. Promotion is quite powerful, as is compensation. They are powerful, in part, because they convey values and community esteem. People work hard to earn money. But, most also work hard to earn the trust and respect of colleagues, peers, subordinates and seniors. If you want to know what behaviors are valued or esteemed in reality, look to see who is promoted and well-compensated and the behaviors that they embody. Do the results match what is said? Do they match your expectation of fairness? Do you aspire to be one of these individuals, not because of their status and compensation alone, but because of the esteem you hold for them and their values?\n\nOver the long haul, the economy needs a vibrant and trustworthy financial sector in order to thrive, just as the financial sector needs a vibrant economy to thrive as well. You are the rising leaders of your firms. You can help accomplish these aims. A strong and ethical culture in the banking industry will make it more trustworthy, and therefore more effective in performing its mission. It will also help the industry be held in higher esteem and this will help attract the talent needed to sustain the industry. I am encouraged by today’s gathering, and hope you will take heart that an improved culture in the financial services industry is both necessary and possible. Thank you for your continued efforts and your kind attention.\n\n1 Stephanie Chaly, James Hennessy, Thomas Noone, Joseph Sommer and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks.\n\n2 See Criminal Accountability and Culture, Remarks by Preet Bharara, Reforming Culture and Behavior in the Financial Services Industry: Expanding the Dialogue, October 20, 2016.\n\n3 See John C.

            "content": "It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to join you again at the Economic Leadership Forum.  I would like to thank John McWeeney of the New Jersey Bankers Association and Rutgers University for the invitation to be here today.  Northern New Jersey is a vital part of the New York Fed’s district, and I don’t just say that because I live here.  My staff and I actively maintain ties with local community, business and banking leaders, and we always benefit from opportunities to hear about what is on your mind. \n\nI am particularly delighted to see that community banks are well represented here today.  The Federal Reserve understands the importance of a vibrant community banking sector and the crucial role community banks play in supporting the activities of local businesses and households.  While protecting the safety and soundness of the financial system is an important part of the Federal Reserve’s mandate, I believe that the regulation of community banks should be appropriately calibrated to reflect the lower degree of risk they pose to the financial system relative to larger banks.  In other words, community banks should not be subject to the same set of regulations that are applied to the most systemically important banking organizations.\n\nIn my remarks, I will discuss the U.S. economic outlook and the implications for U.S. monetary policy. I will focus primarily on last month’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) “lift-off” decision—the first increase in the federal funds rate target range in nearly 10 years. I’ll explain what motivated my vote to begin to normalize U.S. monetary policy. I’ll also offer a preliminary assessment of how things are going so far―both with respect to how the U.S. bond market reacted to lift-off and how well our new tools are working as we begin to push up short-term interest rates. Both issues are pertinent, as money market rates have spent a very long time close to zero and we have never attempted to tighten monetary policy with such a large balance sheet and high level of excess reserves. To summarize my conclusions: Generally so far, so good on both fronts.\n\nLooking ahead, I’ll talk about what comes next. No surprises here—it depends on the data. As noted in the December FOMC statement, we expect that the normalization of monetary policy will be quite gradual. But, there is no commitment here. The flow of the data—broadly defined―will drive our actions as it influences our assessment of the economic outlook and our view of the stance of monetary policy best suited to achieve our dual mandate objectives of maximum sustainable employment and price stability. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the FOMC or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nIn terms of the economic outlook, the situation does not appear to have changed much since the last FOMC meeting. Some recent activity indicators have been on the softer side, pointing to a relatively weak fourth quarter for real GDP growth. But this needs to be weighed against the strength evident in the U.S. labor market. I continue to expect that the economy will expand at a pace slightly above its long-term trend in 2016. In other words, I anticipate sufficient economic strength to push the unemployment rate down a bit further and to more fully utilize the nation’s labor resources.\n\nTurning to inflation, we continue to fall short of our 2 percent objective for the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) deflator. But I take it as a positive sign that the core PCE inflation rate—that is, excluding food and energy—has been quite stable despite the downward pressure being exerted by lower energy prices on the prices of non-energy goods and services, as well as the drop in non-energy import prices from a firmer dollar.\n\nGoing into more detail, U.S. economic activity has areas of both strength and weakness. On the stronger side of the ledger, domestic demand is doing reasonably well. In particular, consumption and housing activity continue to expand at a moderate pace. Consumer spending has been supported by solid real disposable income growth, which has been underpinned, in turn, by sturdy job gains and falling energy prices. Residential investment has been slowly increasing for several years and that trend seems likely to continue in 2016. Housing starts are still well below the rate consistent with the nation’s population growth rate, and the fundamentals of housing demand remain positive. Rising employment is likely to boost the household formation rate and low mortgage interest rates should keep housing relatively affordable, despite the ongoing recovery in home prices. Last month’s passage of a fiscal 2016 budget package should also provide support to economic activity. Not only does this budget package reduce uncertainty about the budgetary outlook, but its extension of a number of tax breaks and easing of the caps on domestic and military spending means that fiscal policy in 2016 will likely turn somewhat stimulative.\n\nOn the weaker side, the collapse in energy prices continues to pull down domestic investment in oil and gas drilling projects. Although this adjustment is now well-advanced, I suspect that there remains a further leg down given the sector’s diminished cash flows and the reduced access to credit. In addition, manufacturing remains very soft—hurt by the drop in energy-related investment, an ongoing inventory adjustment and the loss of competitiveness caused by the persistent strength of the U.S. dollar. Even the one bright spot in manufacturing over the past year—the auto sector—seems to be close to a cyclical peak. Thus, I suspect manufacturing will continue to be soft in 2016. Overseas developments, especially with respect to the emerging market economies, pose a risk to the U.S. economic outlook—potentially exerting greater restraint on the demand for U.S. exports and contributing to greater turbulence in global financial markets. Putting these positives and negatives together, the most likely outlook seems to be more of what we have experienced in this expansion—an economy that grows at slightly above a 2 percent annual rate this year.\n\nThe inflation outlook also has not changed much. Inflation remains well below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent objective. In my assessment, this is due mainly to weaker energy prices and the impact of a stronger dollar on non-energy import prices. However, the fact that core measures of inflation are considerably higher than the headline readings, and have been quite stable in recent months, suggests to me that we are likely to see inflation rise once energy prices stop falling and the dollar stops appreciating—clearly neither trend can persist indefinitely. Of course, this assumes that the U.S. economy grows sufficiently rapidly so that pressure on available labor and capital resources continues to increase.\n\nWith respect to the risks to the inflation outlook, the most concerning is the possibility that inflation expectations become unanchored to the downside. This would be problematic were it to occur because inflation expectations are an important driver of actual inflation. If inflation expectations become unanchored to the downside, it would become much more difficult to push inflation back up to the central bank’s objective. Japan’s difficult experience indicates the importance of avoiding such an outcome.\n\nFor this reason, we closely monitor inflation expectations. Inflation measured by the PCE deflator has been running below the FOMC’s objective since May 2012. A concern is whether these persistent underruns in inflation may be beginning to weigh on inflation expectations. Some surveys of inflation expectations have softened recently. For example, the University of Michigan measure of median long-term household inflation expectations—that is, expected inflation at a five-to ten-year horizon—is currently at 2.6 percent. This is near the very bottom end of its range over the past two decades.\n\nThe New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations also shows softness. The median of 3-year inflation expectations has declined over the past year, falling by 22 basis points to 2.8 percent. While the magnitude of this decline is small, I think it is noteworthy because the current reading is below where we have been during the survey history. Up until July 2014, the median largely stayed in the range from 3.2 to 3.4 percent, and from July 2014 to July 2015 it remained near 3 percent.\n\nWhile it has a short history, I put more weight on the New York Fed’s survey because its methodology should be more robust in accurately assessing consumer inflation expectations. Compared to the more widely followed University of Michigan survey, for example, the New York Fed survey has several advantages. The sample size is larger, most of the people that are interviewed are the same each month, and the inflation expectations question is posed differently to focus the respondent’s attention on inflation rather than on prices. We believe that all these factors lead to a more reliable estimate of inflation expectations.\n\nObviously, I didn’t think the degree of weakness we have seen in our survey measure of inflation expectations was of sufficient concern to defer the start of monetary policy normalization. And, as long as the economy continues to grow at an above-trend pace, I expect the increase in resource utilization will be sufficient to push both inflation and inflation expectations higher over time. That said, should the economy unexpectedly weaken, then this fall in inflation expectations would become more concerning.\n\nAssuming, as I anticipate, that inflation does move back towards our 2 percent target, I am often asked how tolerant would I be of an overshoot? In other words, is the 2 percent inflation target a ceiling or not? I don’t think of the 2 percent objective as a ceiling. I would be equally intolerant of misses relative to 2 percent in both directions, above or below, with my intolerance growing the further we deviated from our 2 percent objective. We will almost certainly never be precisely at our 2 percent objective for any length of time given all the forces—many of which are not under our control—that influence actual inflation outcomes over a business cycle. Thus, with a neutral monetary policy, my goal would be to spend about the same amount of time slightly above as slightly below our 2 percent objective.\n\nTurning now to U.S. monetary policy, why did I favor raising the federal funds rate target last month? Basically, my assessment was that our conditions for lift-off had been met. Recall, these two conditions were: 1) further improvement in the labor market that we anticipated would be sustained in 2016, and 2) greater confidence that inflation would begin to move back towards our 2 percent inflation objective over the medium term.\n\nThe timing of policy normalization involves a balancing of risks. I don’t disagree with our critics that there were risks from lifting off in December versus waiting a little longer. First, the economy might turn out to be more fragile than we anticipate, or economic shocks could push the economy off-course relative to our expectations. In other words, our economic projections might be too optimistic. Second, the first tightening move might itself provoke another taper tantrum characterized by higher bond yields and tighter financial market conditions that could be sufficiently strong to impede the economic recovery.\n\nMy judgment was that these risks were manageable. First, downside forecast errors are certainly possible, but the U.S. economy appears to be on sufficiently sound footing to withstand downside shocks better than was the case a few years ago. Second, I felt that the likelihood of a substantial tightening in financial market conditions due to lift-off was relatively low, in part, because the rate hike was widely anticipated. Market conditions had adjusted quite smoothly—except for some strains observed in the high-yield debt market—as market participants placed higher odds of tightening in the weeks preceding the December FOMC meeting. This reinforced that conclusion. A large market reaction would have been a surprise given that this was one of the most anticipated monetary policy events in history. Also, the policy action needs to be viewed in context. While this decision was the first upward adjustment to short-term rates in nearly 10 years, the actual move was small—only 25 basis points—which, by itself, should have only a very mild impact on the overall trajectory of the economy. As we noted in the FOMC statement and as Chair Yellen pointed out in her December press conference, even after this rate hike, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative.\n\nMoreover, it is important to recognize that there are also significant risks from waiting longer to lift off. Upside forecast errors are also certainly possible. For example, while the pace of growth has generally been weaker than expected in recent years, the pace of labor market improvement has generally been stronger. By waiting, we would increase the risk that we would need to raise rates more aggressively in the future. This could unduly threaten the economic expansion. In balancing these risks, relatively “early and slow” seems like a better strategy than “late and fast”—especially when one is uncertain both about the degree of accommodation being provided by monetary policy and the level of unemployment consistent with our price stability mandate. Because monetary policy works with a lag, policy normalization needs to begin before the economy reaches its employment and inflation objectives. That is, if we are to get to a neutral monetary policy setting before inflation materially overshoots our 2 percent objective, then we need to get started. Once underway, the pace of policy tightening can be calibrated to how the economy and financial market conditions are responding.\n\nA particular risk of late and fast is that the unemployment rate could significantly undershoot the level consistent with price stability. If this occurred, then inflation would likely rise above our objective. At that point, history shows it is very difficult to push the unemployment rate back up just a little bit in order to contain inflation pressures. Looking at the post-war period, whenever the unemployment rate has increased by more than 0.3 to 0.4 percentage points, the economy has always ended up in a full-blown recession with the unemployment rate rising by at least 1.9 percentage points. This is an outcome to avoid, especially given that in an economic downturn the last to be hired are often the first to be fired. The goal is the maximum sustainable level of employment—in other words, the most job opportunities for the most people over the long run.\n\nSome of you may be wondering whether the risk of a recession isn’t already quite high? And, if so, doesn’t this imply a need for special care in adjusting monetary policy? After all, the current economic expansion is more than six years old—a bit long in the tooth by post-war standards.\n\nEven so, recession risk did not play a major factor in my thinking. Economic expansions don’t simply die of old age. They primarily end either because monetary policy is kept too loose for too long, thereby necessitating a subsequent sharp tightening in monetary policy to prevent a significant inflation overshoot, or because some large adverse shock hits the economy that the central bank cannot easily offset. Mitigating the first risk of being forced to choke off the expansion argues for getting started with policy normalization now rather than holding off. With respect to the second risk of unanticipated shocks, this is obviously very difficult for the central bank to insulate the economy from. Making sure the financial system is robust and resilient is probably the most important thing the central bank can do in this respect.\n\nI would like to turn now to the issue of how the initial step in normalization is going. The U.S. bond market response to lift-off has been very mild. There has been no bond market “taper tantrum” such as what occurred in 2013 when Chairman Bernanke discussed the possibility of tapering Federal Reserve asset purchases. Normalization is also going very well in the sense that, even with an extraordinarily large balance sheet, the tools we have developed to raise the federal funds rate (and other money market rates) have so far worked well. The federal funds rate is trading close to the middle of the new target range of 25 to 50 basis points and other money market rates have moved up in tandem.\n\nWhy is this noteworthy? To explain, I’ll first have to provide some background on how monetary policy used to work before the crisis and then compare that regime with how it works now.\n\nBefore the financial crisis, banks valued reserves―even though the Federal Reserve paid no interest on them―because the Federal Reserve kept their supply scarce. When the FOMC wanted to adjust its federal funds rate target—that is, the interest rate banks earn or pay when lending or borrowing overnight reserves with another bank—it directed the System Open Market Account (the Desk) manager in New York to alter the supply of reserves within the banking system (up or down) as needed to match the estimated demand for reserves in order to keep the federal funds rate very close to the FOMC’s target.2 In this setup, the amount of banking reserves in the system—required and excess—was very small and the Desk typically conducted open market operations that added or drained no more than a few billion dollars of reserves from the banking system to ensure that the federal funds rate traded around the FOMC’s target.\n\nIn October 2008, after passage of the TARP legislation, the Federal Reserve was authorized to implement a new tool, the ability to pay interest on required and excess reserves.3 This tool was significant because it meant that the FOMC would be able to control interest rate policy even with a much larger balance sheet and a much larger amount of excess reserves in the banking system. This was important because it gave us more scope to expand the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet to help address the financial crisis and to provide support for the economic recovery, knowing that later, when the recovery took hold, we could raise interest rates even with an enlarged balance sheet. The Fed wouldn’t necessarily be forced to return to the much smaller balance sheet we had prior to 2008 before we could begin the monetary policy normalization process.\n\nWhen interest is paid on reserves, these reserves retain value even when they are no longer scarce. Banks may be able to borrow funds at lower interest rates from financial entities such as money market funds that are not permitted to hold deposits at the Federal Reserve and place these borrowed funds with the Federal Reserve to earn the higher interest rate paid on reserve balances.\n\nHow well the ability to pay interest on reserves works in practice in raising the entire constellation of short-term interest rates depends critically on the willingness of banks to engage in such arbitrage activity. Prior to lift-off, we were uncertain how much friction there might be that would limit the willingness of banks to expand their balance sheets. These frictions include limits on bank leverage that can make the use of balance sheet capacity costly, competitive frictions given the relatively narrow range of banks that are viewed as sufficiently creditworthy to warrant being recipients of large uncollateralized loans and, for those banks that accept FDIC insured deposits, insurance premiums that increase when they borrow reserves and their total liabilities increase.\n\nTo help ensure that money market rates would track the federal funds rate regardless of these frictions, the FOMC developed a second tool—the overnight, fixed-rate, reverse repurchase facility (overnight RRP). In this facility, a number of financial entities, such as money market funds, that cannot hold reserves at the Federal Reserve can lend funds overnight to the Federal Reserve against the Fed’s Treasury collateral and receive the overnight RRP rate—currently 25 basis points. The overnight RRP provides these institutions with an alternative investment if the interest rate offered by banks is unattractive. Consequently, these financial entities should be unwilling to lend funds to banks and others at lower rates than the overnight RRP rate. The overnight RRP rate should act, therefore, as a floor on money market rates.\n\nAs I noted earlier, the tools are working as anticipated. Not only is the federal funds rate trading close to the middle of the new 25 to 50 basis point target range, but the entire complex of money market rates, such as LIBOR deposits and GCF repo, has also risen as well. Moreover, apart from a temporary spike in usage around year end, which was expected, the usage of the overnight, fixed rate reverse repo facility has fallen back to levels similar to what we saw during the testing phase. In recent days, usage has averaged less than $100 billion per day. Thus, the facility has been absorbing only a small fraction of the $2.4 trillion of excess reserves in the banking system. This demonstrates that to firm interest rates, we don’t necessarily have to drain reserves or shrink the size of our balance sheet.\n\nWe are very pleased by how well our tools are working, and this has reinforced our confidence that they will support the policy normalization process going forward. This is what we expected given our extensive testing, but there are always uncertainties that only can be resolved by actually getting underway. For example, there was some residual uncertainty about how important a factor the zero lower bound of interest rates had been in supporting the federal funds rate and other money market rates. This uncertainty now has been at least partially resolved. Even as we have moved away from the zero lower bound, the relative yield relationships we saw before December’s federal funds rate hike have persisted.\n\nSo what’s on the docket for monetary policy in 2016? The answer is that it depends on how the incoming data weighs on the outlook, and how changes in the outlook influence our views on the appropriate setting for monetary policy. What I can say is that our expectation at the December FOMC meeting was for further interest rate hikes in 2016 and beyond. Participants anticipated that the federal funds rate would likely continue on a gradual upward path. Over the longer term, FOMC participants expected that the federal funds rate would eventually reach 3 to 4 percent as inflation rose back to our 2 percent objective and the headwinds from the financial crisis that had been restraining economic activity fully dissipated.\n\nEven though this path is shallow relative to previous tightening cycles, the median federal funds rate path of FOMC participants in the December Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) is well above the path implied by the federal funds futures market. Should this be a concern? Does this imply that there is a significant risk of an abrupt future spike in short- and long-term interest rates as market rates realign to levels more consistent with the median FOMC participants’ projections?\n\nI don’t think so for several reasons. First, the SEP projections are modal forecasts—that is, what the participants believe is most likely to happen—whereas those embodied in market prices are a mean—that is, an average across all possible outcomes. One might reasonably expect these modal forecasts to be above the mean when inflation is low and the economic outlook is uncertain. Second, the median federal funds rate forecasts for primary dealers and for buyside participants surveyed just prior to the December FOMC meeting differed only marginally from the December SEP median projections of FOMC participants. This reinforces my judgment that the difference between means and modes is the main factor for the gap between the federal funds futures market and the SEP paths. Third, the differences between the interest rates implied by futures markets and the SEP have been quite small at shorter-term time horizons, such as the end of 2016, and grow much larger as the time horizon lengthens. I think this is noteworthy because the confidence one has at longer horizons should be much lower than at shorter horizons.\n\nBecause I do not know what the federal funds rate target range will be at the end of 2017 or 2018 with any confidence, I am not very concerned if others have a different modal forecast. Projections will adjust as incoming information changes the economic outlook. I would expect convergence over time of the SEP and market expectations as new information informs the outlook.\n\nLet me close with some observations about my current thinking concerning our reinvestment of maturing Treasury securities and paydowns in our agency MBS holdings. As we noted in the December FOMC statement, we anticipate that we will continue reinvestment “until normalization of the federal funds rate is well underway.” I think this policy makes sense not only because the decision to end reinvestment will represent a further tightening of monetary policy, but also because it is difficult to assess ahead of time the impact of such a decision on financial market conditions given the lack of historical experience.\n\nI also believe that continuing reinvestment until the federal funds rate reaches a higher level makes sense. We want to ensure that we have the ability to respond to adverse shocks by easing monetary policy by lowering the policy rate. Having more “dry powder” in the form of higher short-term interest rates seems more desirable than less dry powder and a smaller balance sheet.\n\nNow the words “well underway” in the FOMC statement are vague—what does that mean in terms of the level of the federal funds rate? Reiterating the disclaimer that I am speaking for myself, my view is that we should not set a numerical tripwire for ending reinvestment. If the economy were growing very quickly and the risks of an early return to the zero lower bound for the federal funds rate were deemed to be low, then I could see ending reinvestment at a relatively low federal funds rate. In contrast, if the economy lacked forward momentum and the risks of a return to the zero lower bound were judged to be considerably higher, I would want to continue reinvestment until the federal funds rate was higher. Consistent with the general principles I mentioned before, the evolution of the overall monetary policy stance—both interest rate decisions and balance sheet developments—should be data dependent.\n\nIn my view, good monetary policy-making requires ongoing assessment and judgment, not the adherence to mechanical rules. I know market participants desire certainty, but in the uncertain world in which we live, that desire is not consistent with the policy that would best achieve our objectives. We will strive to communicate as clearly as we can so you can think along with us and alter your expectations just as we do in response to incoming information.\n\nThank you for kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n1 Antoine Martin, Jamie McAndrews, Jonathan McCarthy, Paolo Pesenti and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks.\n\n2 In this arrangement, the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet was mainly driven by the amount of currency in circulation. As the amount of currency in circulation increased, this drained reserves from the banking system. The Federal Reserve offset this by increasing its holdings of Treasury securities.\n\n3 The Federal Reserve gained the authority to pay interest on reserves earlier as part of the Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006; that legislation authorized the Federal Reserve Banks to begin payment of interest on reserves in 2011. As part of the TARP legislation, Congress moved up the date at which the Federal Reserve could exercise that authority to October 2008."

            "content": "Good morning.  I’m happy to welcome you to the New York Fed for this workshop that is intended to increase our understanding of student debt and how it affects individuals, their families and the economy.  I am delighted to see such widespread and growing interest in this important topic.  Making continued progress on understanding these issues will depend critically on efforts to identify and address existing data gaps that hamper its study.  I am particularly happy to welcome Deputy Secretary Sarah Bloom Raskin, who has spoken frequently and eloquently in the past about the need for improvements in student loan servicing and debt collection, the macroeconomic consequences of increased student debt, and the need for better data and analysis.  I look forward to her remarks today.\n\nBefore I make some specific comments on student debt, let me take a step back and say a few words on household finance more generally.  As always, what I say represents my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nThere are several reasons the New York Fed has increased its focus on household finance.  First, the financial crisis made it obvious that an ability to understand and anticipate what is happening in the household sector is essential to gauging the strength and resiliency of the U.S. economy.  Second, our policy actions are intended to change the incentives facing households, so it is important to be able to gauge how our policies are transmitted into household financial decisions.  Good information on household borrowing, for example, allows us to see how monetary policy affects outcomes such as auto loan originations.  Third, better household finance research helps support our community outreach and development missions.\n\nA major challenge to achieving these goals is that household finances have traditionally been poorly documented.  We have lots of information about corporate sector debt and equity, but comparable basic facts about the household sector are much harder to come by.  For example, the lack of timely, comprehensive data made it more difficult to understand how vulnerable the household sector’s financial position had become by 2007.\n\nI’m happy to say that we’ve made progress in beginning to close this data gap.  At the New York Fed, we’ve been able to develop products that support a much better understanding of the household sector’s borrowing behavior, ranging from loan-level mortgage information to credit card utilization and borrowing limits.  This has greatly improved our knowledge of household debt burdens, new borrowing activity, debt repayment as well as delinquencies.  We’ve made a point of passing along these insights to the public through our Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit, various blog posts and interactive online maps of mortgage delinquencies.  It has required a substantial commitment of resources to obtain the data and extract the information from them, but I’m convinced that it’s been the right course of action.\n\nWhich brings me to the subject of today’s workshop: student loans.\n\nAs you know, student debt is an increasingly important form of credit both for households and for the economy.  In 2010, aggregate outstanding student loan balances surpassed credit card indebtedness, and in 2013 eclipsed a trillion dollars.  During the historic household deleveraging that took place between 2008 and 2013, student debt bucked the trend, and was the only form of household credit that continued to increase each year.\n\nThere are many reasons for this growth, some of which are well-documented—including increasing numbers of individuals who are pursuing post-secondary education, increasing durations in school and higher tuitions.  A less well-known contributor to the growing student debt balances was highlighted recently by a team of New York Fed economists.2  Using credit bureau data that track the quarterly balance and payment status of student loans, they have shown that the overall rate of repayment of outstanding student loans is very low, with many borrowers being delinquent on their loans.\n\nNow, it’s probably fair to say that each form of household debt has distinctive features.  A researcher must understand these differences in order to understand the role that a particular kind of debt plays in household decision-making.  But student debt is perhaps the most distinctive form.  Let me explain what I mean.\n\nUnlike virtually all other forms of credit, student loans are generally not underwritten: they are frequently offered to young borrowers who have little or no credit history and little to no current income.  The amount of credit extended, on average, runs in the tens of thousands of dollars.  These loans are also not collateralized, nor are the interest rates risk-based.  However, lenders (now primarily the taxpayers), are given additional security in that student loans, unlike other forms of debt, are not dischargeable in bankruptcy.  This also means that delinquent student loans tend to remain on a borrower’s credit record long after the borrower has stopped making payments, thus leading to very high measured rates of delinquency.  In addition, many special programs exist to allow borrowers to postpone repayment on their student loans to an extent not available for other kinds of household lending.  New York Fed economists have shown that for the 2009 cohort of graduates, only 17 percent of their original debt had been paid down after five years.3  More than 20 percent of high-balance student borrowers owe more now than when they graduated in 2009.  For the 2005 cohort of graduates, only 38 percent of their original student debt had been paid down, on average, nearly ten years after graduation.\n\nThese loans are used to finance human capital investment projects with returns that are highly uncertain.  It’s true that virtually every study finds that the returns on college degrees are high, on average, relative to their cost.  But some people who take out student loans don’t end up with these high average returns.  The net returns for some may, in fact, be negative.  For example, many who have pursued vocational training may be less remunerated in the market.  Similarly, some students attend certain for-profit universities with track records that indicate that their graduates have lower lifetime earnings than other types of educational institutions.  While others drop out before receiving a degree—just 59 percent of the 2006 cohort had received their four-year degree by 2012.  Of course, uncertain returns are a feature of most investments, but for other loan types this uncertainty is generally managed more effectively through credit underwriting, collateralization and risk-based interest rates.\n\nWe are fairly confident in the aggregate statistics—over a trillion dollars in loan balances outstanding, 43 million borrowers and the highest delinquency rates of any form of household debt.  But we know a lot less about the precise causes and consequences of the heterogeneity in the net returns to educational investments that I just described.  What we know so far, based on very imperfect data, suggests that this heterogeneity is likely to be very important.  We have gained an increasing understanding that how we finance post-secondary education has significant effects on a variety of critical economic outcomes, including economic growth and inequality.  For example, our research suggests that higher student debt and delinquencies reduce household formation and depress homeownership.\n\nBut there are many important questions still left unanswered.  What is the relationship between the amount and type of educational investment that people make and their outcomes?  What attributes are associated with borrowers who are more successful at repaying their student loans?  Are there particular types of degrees that are associated with better performance with respect to student debt repayment or with better living standards earlier in life?  What are the best interventions to help borrowers avoid the consequences of delinquency and default, and to limit any default costs to taxpayers?  Do borrowers who use programs like income-based repayment eventually succeed in paying off their debts?  How do income-based repayment programs affect important decisions such as labor supply, consumption and household formation?\n\nThese are important questions for the nation, as the human capital of our citizens is far and away our most important asset, and student loans are an important mechanism for financing needed investments in that asset.  But it is very hard to answer these questions with existing data.  We need to link information on borrower decisions about the kind and amount of education they receive to long-run outcomes for them and for the overall economy.\n\nSo I commend to you the work before you—finding new ways to get the information that policymakers need to answer important questions about how we finance higher education.  I look forward to your insights and recommendations.\n\n1 Andrew Haughwout, Joseph Tracy and Wilbert van der Klaauw assisted in preparing these remarks.\n\n2 ,3 Payback Time?

            "content": "It is a pleasure to be here today and to have the opportunity to talk about the role of economics and economists at the Reserve Banks.  Economics is a critical discipline at the New York Fed, just as it is at the Board of Governors and the other Reserve Banks. \n\nNevertheless, I expect that my perspective will differ a bit from that of Eric, Charlie, or Narayana1. In part, this is because my background is different.  Although I have a Ph.D. from Berkeley, unlike Charlie and Narayana, I never spent time in academia, and, unlike Eric, I spent most of my career not in public service, but working in the private sector.  My focus during my time in the private sector was also somewhat different than my colleagues, with an emphasis on those issues that affect financial markets. Don't get me wrong, I am very happy I got a Ph.D. in economics, the training has been invaluable.  It's just that my career path is a bit unusual relative to other central bankers, so that must influence my perspective. \n\nOf course, another important point of differentiation is where I am now and the unique role that the New York Fed performs within the Federal Reserve System.  All of the Federal Reserve Banks have their areas of specialization.  In my opinion, the New York Fed has at least four that are worthy of mention today because these affect the work of the New York Fed's economists. \n\nFirst, we are the operational arm of the Federal Reserve, responsible for the implementation of monetary policy.  This means we have a unique set of relationships with the securities dealer community and with respect to monitoring financial markets.  It also means that we work very closely with the Board of Governors and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in implementing monetary policy.  \n\nSecond, we have a unique endowment and responsibility by virtue of our location.  New York City is a global financial center, and finance is a very important aspect of the Second District's economy. Most of the largest global financial institutions have a major presence here.  With delegated authority from the Board of Governors, we are responsible for the supervision of most of the major financial institutions headquartered in our district, as well as numerous foreign banking organizations that do business here.\n\nThird, we are the fiscal agent for the Treasury and conduct the Treasury debt auctions on their behalf.  Additionally, we are responsible for Fedwire, which along with Clearing House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS), is one of the two large-dollar, real-time payment systems in the U.S. \n\nFourth, we have a unique set of international duties.  We provide banking services to foreign central banks, including investment of reserves and administration of foreign exchange swap lines.  We also have a seat at the table in Basel with respect to the activities of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), its various committees, and the Financial Stability Board (FSB).\n\nAs I noted earlier, economics is a critical discipline at the New York Fed.   The New York Fed economists are not just theoreticians.  Most have a strong empirical orientation and work very closely with those in the Bank that are responsible for the execution of policy—be it with respect to monetary policy, financial stability, supervision or payments services.  What's special to me about the Bank is how the economists and non-economists work together to develop practical policy solutions to real-world problems and then implement those policies effectively.\n\nThe breadth of activities at the New York Fed means that our economists contribute to policy in many different ways, working closely with other areas of the Bank including those who execute on our supervision, monetary policy, and payments responsibilities.  We have about 60 Ph.D. economists in our Research Group.  But we also have many more in other areas of the Bank, such as part of our open markets desk, in our supervision group, and in our risk functions.  In fact, many of those with economics Ph.D.s elsewhere in the Bank started their careers at the Bank in the Research Group.  They moved to other areas of the Bank as their interests evolved and they became less focused on research and more focused on policy development.  This movement of economists throughout the organization has helped build a deep reservoir of human capital within the Bank and has fostered close collaboration between Research and other areas of the Bank. \n\nOur model with respect to attracting economists into our Research Group is to hire people with strong research skills, with the highest academic credentials and who already have or are likely to develop a policy orientation related to the Bank's work.  We give our economists plenty of time and opportunity to conduct independent research, and expect them to publish their research in the major academic journals and to engage with the economics profession outside the Bank.  As they progress in research capability, we require economists to apply the skills and techniques they use in research to policy issues.  We expect that, as their academic careers develop, there will be a natural convergence between their research interests and the Bank's policy agenda. This usually happens as a matter of course because the Bank has a rich agenda of policy issues to work on and the economists at the Bank often have unique access to data and information that would not be available elsewhere.  The convergence works in both directions: research informs the policy work and policy work generates research questions. The end result is that our economists have the ability to be both highly respected in their disciplines from a research perspective, and also to make a significant contribution to policy development and implementation.  There is an excellent value proposition both for the Bank and the economists that work here, as indicated by the publication record of our economists and their contribution to policy initiatives. \n\nLet me give you some more concrete examples of what our economists have worked on or are currently working on.  I will focus on three broad buckets: prudential policy and financial stability; monetary and macroeconomic policy; and microeconomic and regional economic policy.\n\nPrudential policy and financial stability\nNew York Fed economists, inside and outside our Research Group, provided substantial assistance to the design and development of the numerous emergency lender of last resort facilities implemented during the financial crisis.  This was done in conjunction with the Board of Governors, but the contributions from the New York Fed were critical because of our unique vantage point with respect to operational implementation, financial markets, and financial market infrastructures.\n\nIn a different vein, New York Fed economists assisted in designing, developing, and implementing supervisory stress testing, including the annual Comprehensive and Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) supervisory stress tests.  The New York Fed's economists perspectives and measurements on how downturns affect bank portfolio values was crucial to the design of these tests.  A critical aspect of CCAR was the development of independent detailed models for the key bank business lines to act as an independent check on the risk assessments by the banks. Of course, this effort also drew on work at the Board of Governors and the rest of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAs well, our economists have played a role in developing international and domestic regulatory policy with respect to bank capital and liquidity standards.  For instance, measurement of capital losses over time, and various run-off rates of different types of liabilities by our economists informed this work.  Also, our economists' work on broker-dealer liquidity informed the design of the liquidity coverage ratio. \n\nFinally, our economists pay special attention to the emerging area of financial stability monitoring.  This takes place in a number of realms, including participation in the work of the Basel Committees, such as the Committee on Global Financial Stability (CGFS) of the BIS, that I currently chair, and the Committee on Payments and Settlement Systems (CPSS), which I once chaired, the numerous workgroups and committees of the Financial Stability Board, and ongoing contributions to the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC).  With respect to the FSOC, for example, New York and Chicago Fed economists have played a key role in editing the FSOC annual reports.  \n\nA few other examples of our economists' involvement in prudential and regulator policy include:\n\nMonetary policy and macroeconomic policy\nEconomists provide invaluable input to the New York Fed President, who serves as Vice-Chairman of the FOMC, and to the Markets Group, which is responsible for the operational aspects of monetary policy implementation. \n\nThis work has many aspects, including: \n\nMicroeconomic and regional policy\nNew York Fed economists also have important opportunities supporting microeconomic and regional policy.  These include the survey of consumer expectations, which will launch this month, and the consumer credit panel, which, using raw data supplied by Equifax, allows us to develop insights into consumer indebtedness at the micro-level.  These panels give us and the public unique insights into household beliefs and behavior.  One example is the work highlighting the growing aggregate student loan debt balance and repayment burden.\n\nAn important responsibility for each of the Reserve Banks is coverage of economic development in its region. A significant aspect of this work at the New York Fed involves our regional press briefings, business surveys, and white papers.  One notable example has been the New York Fed economists' work in developing a white paper that highlighted some key choices that Puerto Rican policymakers might make to eliminate structural constraints that have impinged on the Island's economic performance. \n\nI'm very pleased by the contributions of our economists in the Bank, whether they sit in the Research Group or elsewhere in the Bank.  I think we have helped to contribute to the considerable progress made on a number of fronts, including making the financial system more resilient and robust and helping make monetary policy more effective, even at the zero lower bound.\n\nBut there is much more work to do.  In particular, I think we have just scratched the surface in understanding how developments in one area, such as capital and liquidity requirements for large, complex financial institutions, affect other areas, such as effective monetary policy implementation. We still don't have well developed macro-models that incorporate a realistic financial sector.  We don't understand fully how large-scale asset purchase programs work to ease financial market conditions—is it the effect of the purchases on the portfolios of private investors, or alternatively is the major channel one of signaling? \n\nThere are many other riddles that remain to be solved.  How does one design an effective reference rate that is informative, verifiable and not vulnerable to manipulation?  If you manage to come up with one, how do you migrate the trillions of dollars of existing contracts to the new standard?  The U.S. unemployment rate has declined more sharply than one might expect given the economy's growth rate over the past few years.  Is this permanent or will it reverse if the economy continues to grow and the pressure on labor market resources increases in the coming years?   How does one end “too big to fail” for large global firms operating across different jurisdictions?  The list goes on and on.  There is plenty to work on and think about.\n\nFinally, let me take up one other question that Stan has posed: Do I think you need to be an economist to be the President at the New York Fed?  I don't think so.  If you look at the past five Presidents—Volcker, Corrigan, McDonough, Geithner, and myself, some have been economists, some haven't.  Yet I think all my predecessors have been very effective. \n\nI think there are other attributes that are more important than being an economist: 1) An analytical orientation; 2) the ability to synthesize a broad range of material so as to understand the interactions of markets, financial institutions, and regulatory and macroeconomic policy; 3) open-mindedness and pragmatism—the world is complicated and ever changing; and 4) the ability to lead—that means identifying the key issues and motivating people to do their best work in order to develop new insights and approaches. \n\nHaving an economics background probably helps, especially on the analytics side, but, in my view, is by no means necessary and certainly not sufficient.  One point on which I am certain is that regardless of the background of the President, having a very strong research group is essential.\n\nThanks for your kind attention."

            "href": null,
            "content": "Thank you for having me here to speak today.  As you all know from daily experience, the financial system plays an essential role in modern economies.  Because financial intermediation is critical to economic activity, disruption to it can cause severe damage to the economy.  The experience of recent years revealed serious flaws in the system.  Risk was mispriced and there was a build-up of excesses before the crisis.  Structural weaknesses in the financial system then amplified the effect of the bursting of the bubble in U.S. house prices, and the result was a widespread financial crisis.\n\nOne critical factor was the extensive use of short-term wholesale funding in the years leading up to the crisis.  Not only did this aspect of our financial system create the potential for a firm to fail in an extraordinarily rapid manner when faced with a loss of market confidence, but it also served as a channel through which the effects of those failures were widely propagated throughout the broader financial system. \n\nAlthough much has been done over the past few years to mitigate the structural flaws that make wholesale funding a point of weakness in the global financial system, some important issues and vulnerabilities remain.  I will focus my remarks today on some of those vulnerabilities—including the areas of tri-party repo and money market mutual funds markets—and discuss what could be done to make wholesale funding markets more stable.1\n\nI will also consider the larger issue of the appropriate role of wholesale funding in the financial system.  How comfortable should we be with a system in which critical financial activities continue to be financed with short-term wholesale funding without the safeguards necessary to reduce the risk of runs and the fire sales of assets that can threaten the stability of the entire financial system?\n\nAs always, my remarks reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System. \n\nWholesale funding as a structural vulnerability\nAs this audience knows, in the two decades before the financial crisis, the global financial system underwent rapid transformation.  During this period, there was a shift from bank-based financial intermediation to capital markets-based financial intermediation,2 and an increase in the scale and complexity of securitization activities.\n\nIn the pre-crisis period the growth of securitization was accompanied by a growing reliance on short-term funds raised in wholesale markets to finance securities and activities essential to securitization.  This ranged from the use of repo3 funding to finance inventories of securities held for market-making4 purposes to the issuance of asset-backed commercial paper by conduits5 created to acquire and hold securities.\n\nThe increased use of short-term wholesale finance was driven both by demand and supply factors.  On the demand side, it was more profitable to use shorter-term funds to finance longer-term assets.  On the supply side, such funding was plentiful because it was viewed as safe and because of the growing institutionalization of savings with corporations and institutional investors in need of deposit-like products in which to place their cash balances.   After all, the funds were only exposed for a short period of time, and in the case of repo, secured by collateral.\n\nThe growing reliance on short-term wholesale funding to finance longer-term assets increased liquidity and maturity mismatch risk.  This was particularly dangerous because many of the assets being financed were structured-credit products, some of which were opaque, difficult to value and illiquid.  \n\nShort-term funding of longer-term assets is inherently unstable particularly in the presence of information and coordination problems.  It can be rational for a provider of funds to supply funds on a short-term basis, reasoning that it can exit if there is any uncertainty over the firm’s continued ability to roll over its funding from other sources. But if the use of short-term funding becomes sufficiently widespread, the firm’s roll-over risk increases.  In this situation, there is a strong incentive for each lender to “run” if there is any uncertainty that could undermine the borrower’s ability to continue to roll over its funding from other sources.  This is the case even if the provider of funds believes that the borrower would remain solvent as long as it retained access to funding on normal terms. \n\nOf course, this insight is not a new one.  Prior to the establishment of a lender of last resort and retail deposit insurance for banks—which came with the quid pro quo of prudential regulation—bank runs were a regular and disruptive feature of our financial system.  These innovations solved the coordination problem and stabilized this source of funding.\n\nWhat was new prior to the crisis was the extent to which maturity transformation and financial intermediation began to take place outside of commercial banks.  This activity occurred largely without the types of safeguards—robust prudential regulation, deposit insurance, lender of last resort—that have safeguarded the commercial banking system from the types of widespread panics and runs that are capable of destabilizing the entire financial system.  The risk created by this gap in coverage was not well recognized by regulators or the private sector.  Market participants had little incentive to internalize the negative externality of run-risk created by their collective choice of finance and made erroneous assumptions about the liquidity of asset markets and the capacity and willingness of banks to distribute central bank liquidity to the wider financial system during periods of stress. \n\nBecause the boom years resulted in strong earnings, low price volatility and few credit losses, firms were able to operate at extreme levels of leverage.  When the housing bubble started to deflate, the vulnerabilities of this type of business model soon became apparent.\n\nHeavy reliance on short-term wholesale funding exposed the system to a series of intertwined downward spirals in asset and funding markets.  This spread in waves, beginning in the market for asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) issued by off-balance-sheet conduits, and spreading via auction-rate securities, to the repo, money market and financial commercial paper markets that formed the core financing for market-based financial intermediation.\n\nInitial declines in asset prices forced leveraged holders with maturity mismatches to sell assets.  This increased price volatility and reduced the value of the assets that collateralized other firms’ borrowings.  Higher volatility led banks and secured lenders to raise margins, while concern about counterparty risk and their own funding needs made banks reluctant to on-lend liquidity. \n\nHigher margins on repo and increased collateral calls due to credit ratings downgrades reduced the quantity of assets that could be financed in repo markets and elsewhere, prompting further asset sales.6  As wholesale investors started to exit, this set in motion a bad dynamic—a fire sale of assets that cut into earnings and capital.  This just increased the incentives of investors to run and for banks to hoard liquidity against the risk that they could themselves face a run.  This downward spiral of fire sales and funding runs was a key feature of the financial crisis.\n\nSpecific institutional weaknesses\nThe fragility of short-term wholesale funding was greatly aggravated by certain critical institutional shortcomings in these markets, particularly in the structure of the tri-party repo system and the U.S. money market mutual fund business.   \n\nThrough the tri-party repo market, the two large clearing banks were providing a large amount of intraday credit to securities firms each day to facilitate the daily “unwind” of the prior day’s transactions.7 In the run-up to the crisis, the daily “unwind” practice helped make tri-party repo look like a very liquid investment while still being an apparently highly durable source of funding.  This masked the underlying risks and contributed to weak risk management practices.\n\nAs the concerns about the U.S. housing market escalated in 2007, participants in the tri-party repo market became increasingly concerned about the liquidity and credit risks that they faced.  The clearing banks became uncomfortable with their large intraday exposures to their tri-party securities firm customers.  After all, if a securities firm were to fail suddenly, the clearing banks could be stuck with huge loans to these counterparties, secured by securities that were not necessarily high quality and liquid.   Thus, as the condition of the most troubled securities firms deteriorated, there was a risk that one morning a clearing bank might decide not to unwind a firm’s tri-party transactions in order to avoid a large intraday exposure.  \n\nThis risk faced by the clearing banks, in turn, unnerved the tri-party repo investors.  After all, if the unwind did not occur, they would be stuck with the collateral securing their loans from the night before.  Most of these investors were not prepared to take possession of and liquidate such collateral, and had no interest in doing so.  The incentives for these investors were to run at the first sign of trouble to avoid getting stuck with the dealer’s collateral. \n\nThis incentive to run was reinforced by the fact that if the investors were stuck with the collateral, they would have strong incentives to sell it quickly in order to generate the liquidity needed to meet redemption calls or to keep their portfolios in line with regulatory guidelines.  Such “fire sales” of assets could result in losses and could be extremely destabilizing to markets.\n\nThe crisis also made it clear that the monies provided to the money market mutual funds by their own investors were also inherently unstable.  This made such funds, in turn, an unreliable source of finance in repo, commercial paper and other markets.  Investors in a fixed net asset value (NAV) money market fund could take their money out on a daily basis at par value, with no redemption penalty.   This could occur even if the money market fund did not have sufficient cash or liquid assets that it could easily sell to meet all potential redemptions.  This created an incentive for investors to be the first to get out whenever there was any uncertainty over the underlying value of the assets in the fund.  By being first in line, they could exit while the fund could still repay at par, leaving others to bear any losses.  The longer the investor waited, the greater the risk that the fund would be forced into the fire sale of assets to meet redemptions and end up “breaking the buck.”\n\nAs the crisis unfolded, the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury and others took a series of actions to contain the spiral of funding runs and asset fire sales.  First, the traditional lender of last resort function was strengthened through the introduction of the Term Auction Facility (TAF) and foreign exchange swaps with foreign central banks.\n\nThen, as the crisis intensified, lender of last resort liquidity provision was extended to directly backstop key wholesale funding markets and opened to certain nonbank firms.  The Federal Reserve created a direct backstop to the tri-party repo system through the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF).  When the Reserve Fund broke the buck after the failure of Lehman Brothers, precipitating a run on money market mutual funds, the Treasury guaranteed money market fund assets and the Fed introduced the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Fund Liquidation Facility (AMLF).  The Fed also backstopped the commercial paper market (formerly funded in large part by money market mutual funds) by introducing the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF).  When wholesale funding for non-residential mortgage securitizations evaporated, the Fed rolled out the Term Asset-Backed Lending Facility (TALF).  \n\nThese actions ultimately stabilized funding markets and crowded back in private funds.  But, they were an emergency response, not a sustainable, long-term solution.  After all, because most of the special Fed liquidity facilities were authorized under Section 13.3 of the Federal Reserve Act  they were required to be temporary in nature and end when times were no longer “unusual and exigent.”\n\nStatus of reforms\nSince the crisis, a number of steps have been taken that reduce the vulnerability of the system to funding runs in short-term wholesale markets.  Capital and liquidity requirements for large complex financial institutions have been raised sharply, the largest broker-dealers have become part of bank holding companies subject to additional regulation, and risk-weights on assets have been adjusted to better capture risks and to reduce the scope for regulatory capital arbitrage by banks.\n\nHigher capital levels for bank holding companies reduce the incentive for providers of funds to run from these firms at the first sign of trouble.  Higher liquidity buffers8 also help so that banks do not have to sell illiquid assets at the first signs of funding difficulties.  This reduces the fire sale risk: that the sale of illiquid assets will depress asset values, potentially turning a solvent firm into an insolvent one. \n\nMeanwhile, the New York Fed has led a Federal Reserve effort to make the tri-party repo system more resilient to stress.  In particular, the Fed has pressed the two large clearing banks to make changes to their settlement processes that will diminish their own intraday exposure and enable the market to operate with much less reliance on intraday credit.9 These efforts are starting to bear fruit: the share of trading activity that requires intraday credit extensions by clearing banks has declined from 100 percent before November 2012 to approximately 80 percent currently, and is expected to fall to 10 percent by the end of next year.10\n\nReducing the market’s dependency on intraday credit will make the market more resilient to future stress events, by forcing all participants to consider the credit and liquidity risks they are exposed to.\n\nMeanwhile, in 2010, the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) tightened the liquidity requirements and concentration limit rules for 2a-7 money market mutual funds and increased the fund manager disclosure requirements.  These changes, which were intended as a first step, make money funds somewhat less risky.  But, they do little to reduce investors’ incentives to run at the first sign of trouble. \n\nWorthwhile as the steps taken thus far are, we have not come close to fixing all the institutional flaws in our wholesale funding markets.  The tri-party repo system and the money fund industry that plays a crucial role financing collateral through it are both still exposed to runs.  In fact, in each of these areas, one could argue that the risks have increased compared to prior to the crisis.  That is because the Dodd-Frank Act raised the hurdle for the Federal Reserve to exercise its Section 13.3 emergency lending authority and because Congress has explicitly precluded the U.S. Treasury from guaranteeing money market mutual fund assets in the future.   With extraordinary interventions ruled out or made much more difficult, this may cause investors to be even more skittish in the future.  This is why it is essential to make the system more stable.\n\nTurning first to the issue of tri-party repo reform, there is still considerable work to do.  In particular, the risk that investors will run at the first sign of trouble persists.  That is because the costs of running are very low relative to the potential costs of staying put.  The potential costs of staying are elevated in part because investors often don’t have the capacity to take possession of the collateral or liquidate the collateral in an orderly way should a large dealer fail.  Both aspects result in run risk, fire sale risk and potential financial instability.\n\nLet me be clear.  We must deal with the fire sale issue in tri-party repo and the heightened run risk it creates.  I believe there are three potential ways forward, all of which are superior to the status quo.   First, tri-party repo transactions could be restricted to open market operations (OMO) eligible collateral.11 Such collateral would likely remain quite liquid during a time of crisis.12 In addition, such collateral could, in a crisis, potentially be passed directly by a broker-dealer to the discount window under Section 13.13 authority, or, because of beneficial treatment under Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act, be financed by a banking affiliate that would then itself borrow at the discount window.  Thus, one could construct an effective lender of last resort backstop for an OMO-eligible- only tri-party repo system. \n\nHowever, there are also some significant disadvantages to such an approach.  The less liquid collateral could just migrate to be financed elsewhere, with associated run and fire sale risks.  Also, given that housing finance reform could cause the agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to be replaced by something different that was not OMO eligible under the Federal Reserve Act, the share of assets that are OMO eligible could diminish over time.  Finally, this approach would do little to mitigate the risk of fire sales of a defaulted dealer’s collateral by its investors once a dealer is bankrupt.\n\nThe second option is to have a mechanism or process to facilitate the orderly liquidation of a defaulted dealer’s collateral.  One could imagine a mechanism that was funded by tri-party repo market participants and potentially backstopped by the central bank.  This would have the advantage of dealing with the entire tri-party repo market and not artificially favoring one type of collateral over another.  It would also push against the underpricing of liquidity and credit risk during good times by forcing market participants to pay for the costs of a liquidation facility up front. \n\nBecause no single market participant has a strong incentive to develop such a mechanism, however, sustained regulatory pressure may be required to reach such a solution.  From the perspective of the tri-party repo borrowers and investors, the status quo undoubtedly is viewed as superior because neither group is forced to fully bear the externalities associated with their actions.  Instead they anticipate that emergency liquidity would be made available in the event of a future systemic crisis.\n \nThird, if borrowers and investors did not embrace an orderly collateral liquidation mechanism, supervisory oversight could be brought to bear to limit the use of tri-party repo funding on the grounds that it is still an unstable source of funds.  For example, the use of tri-party repo could be restricted unless borrowers demonstrated that there was an adequate means of orderly collateral liquidation upon the failure of a major dealer.\n\nTurning next to the issue of money market mutual funds, further reform to directly address the incentive for investors to run is essential for financial stability.\n\nIn November, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) put out for comment three alternative paths forward:13\n\n1. Moving to a floating net asset value (NAV).\n2. Retaining a stable NAV, but adding a new NAV buffer and a minimum balance requirement.  The minimum balance would be at risk for 30 days following withdrawals.  If the fund subsequently “broke the buck” during this period by suffering losses greater than the size of its NAV buffer, the minimum balance would be first in line to absorb these losses.\n3. A larger NAV buffer than in the second alternative, but without a minimum balance at risk buffer.\n\nI have stated my views on money fund reform before.14 Although any of these proposals—depending on the fine print of course—would likely be an improvement over the status quo, the first and third proposals don’t fully eliminate the incentives to run.  In the case of a floating rate NAV, fund managers faced with large redemption requests typically sell their most liquid assets first, leaving the remaining investors with a riskier, less-liquid portfolio and a greater risk of loss. Similarly, with a stable NAV and a capital buffer, unless the capital buffer were very large, there would still be an incentive to run because the buffer might not prove large enough to shield the investor from loss.\n\nBecause the second option is the only one that actually creates a disincentive to run, as I stated before the FSOC proposal, I view it as the best one for financial stability purposes.  The requirement that investors who withdraw funds must maintain a small balance for a short period to absorb near-term losses would deter investors from pulling out at the first glimpse of trouble and make the system safer.  The modest withdrawal restrictions, which create a “minimum balance at risk,” might be set at 5 cents on the dollar, based on the high-water mark of recent holdings, with more favorable treatment for small retail investors.15 \n\nA minimum balance at risk of loss would also increase market discipline. Corporations and other sophisticated investors would have an incentive to monitor risk-taking more carefully, rather than rely on their ability to get out ahead of small retail investors when trouble materializes.\n\nThe larger question\nReforming the tri-party repo system and the money market mutual fund industry is essential and would make the financial system significantly more stable. But even after such reforms, we would still have a system in which a very significant share of financial intermediation activity vital to the economy takes place in markets and through institutions that have no direct access to an effective lender of last resort backstop.16\n\nThe financial crisis clearly demonstrated that we can no longer assume that in periods of stress banks will be willing to access lender of last resort loans and on-lend to the nonbank financial sector at sufficient scale to stabilize the system of market-based financial intermediation, as happened in earlier periods such as the commercial paper crisis in the mid-1970s.\n\nThe financing needs outside the commercial banks may be too large relative to the capacity of the banking system, banks may be reluctant to lend to competitors, be concerned about their own liquidity and funding needs, or simply be deterred by elevated counterparty risk.  \n  \nWe need to consider whether our current architecture is satisfactory.   If we were to decide that the existing state of affairs is not acceptable in financial stability terms, there are two broad paths we could follow.   \n\nThe first option would be to take steps to curtail the extent of short-term wholesale finance in the system.  In principle, regulators across a broader set of institutions and markets could take steps to directly limit the use of short-term wholesale funding to finance longer-term assets, and take actions that reduced the amount of maturity transformation associated with securitization markets.  In other words, regulators could require that a greater proportion of market-based finance be funded by longer-term debt.  Alternatively, additional legislation or regulatory changes could be implemented to reduce the volume of wholesale-funded, capital markets activities.\n\nIt is also true that some of the measures under debate in the area of limiting the scope of activity or the scale of certain financial institutions, three of which were explored by  my colleague Federal Reserve Governor Dan Tarullo in a recent speech, would likely have the effect of reducing the use of short-term wholesale funding relative to the current status quo.17  For example, if regulators were to cap the size of a bank’s overall liabilities relative to gross domestic product (GDP) not only would this have the effect  of capping the size of individual firms, but it also would likely limit the use of short-term wholesale funding by the largest institutions. \n\nThe other path would be to expand the range of financial intermediation activity that is directly backstopped by the central bank’s lender of last resort function. This expanded range could be defined either in terms of access by the types of firms that are systemically important in market-based finance, or by types of activity or assets.\n\nIt is worth pausing here to review in a little more detail the two key functions performed by a lender of last resort.  The first function is to provide a precautionary backstop:  to reduce the risk of a financial panic beginning in the first place by ensuring that collateral can always be financed.18 The first function is important because it makes it less likely that investors will back away from firms because they think others perceive an elevated risk of insolvency, even if they themselves do not share this view. Thus, a lender of last resort facility can reduce the risk of financial instability due to coordination problems even if the lender of last resort is not utilized.19 In contrast, an emergency facility is unlikely to be as effective.  There will be uncertainty around whether it will be deployed, whether it will arrive in time, and how broad it will be.     \n\nThe second function of a lender of last resort is to prevent the fire sale of assets by firms facing a sudden loss of funding from spreading contagion across the system and disrupting the provision of credit to the economy.  This is particularly important during a financial panic, when the demand for liquidity increases sharply.  Only the central bank has the ability to meet this increased demand under any potential circumstances.\n\nWe have banking activity—maturity transformation—taking place today outside commercial banks.   If we believe these activities provide essential credit intermediation services to the real economy that could not be easily replaced by other forms of intermediation, then the same logic that leads us to backstop commercial banking with a lender of last resort might lead us to backstop the banking activity taking place in the markets in a similar way.   \n\nHowever, any expansion of access to a lender of last resort would require legislation and it would be essential to have the right quid pro quo—the commensurate expansion in the scope of prudential oversight.  Substantial prudential regulation of entities—such as broker-dealers20 —that might gain access to an expanded lender of last resort would be required to mitigate moral hazard problems.  For example, firms might take less care in managing liquidity and capital if they know they have a lender of last resort backstop and be subject to less counterparty and creditor discipline.  In addition, the fact that an institution has access to a lender of last resort facility has value to the institution, even if that institution never taps the facility.  Thus, without a corresponding imposition of offsetting obligations and costs, the granting of access would create a significant competitive advantage. \n\nExtension of discount window-type access to a set of nonbank institutions would therefore have to go hand-in-hand with prudential regulation of these institutions.   Many thorny issues would have to be resolved.   For example, who would have access and on what terms and conditions? How would foreign-owned broker-dealers be treated?  Would an insurance-type payment be appropriate for firms that enjoyed lender of last resort access but did not have insured deposits?  How would the Fed’s role, as the lender of last resort, be coordinated with the oversight responsibilities of the primary regulators? \n\nConclusion\nWhich path to go down—limit wholesale funding or backstop it more broadly—would depend in large part on the social value of the capital markets-based activities presently being financed in unstable short-term wholesale markets and the utility of short-term wholesale funding for lenders.\n\nOf course, the choice might not be as black and white as this.  Some activities undertaken by securities firms or other nonbank entities presumably are much more socially useful than others.  In this case, legislators might deem that certain classes of securities firms should be granted access to a lender of last resort facility, but restricted in the scope of their permitted activities to those that do clearly create social value.  \n\nThe sheer size of banking functions undertaken outside commercial banking entities—even now, after the crisis—suggests that this issue must not be ignored.  I don’t think we should be comfortable with a situation in which extensive maturity transformation continues to take place without the appropriate safeguards against runs and fire sales.  Pretending the problem does not exist, or dealing with it only ex post through emergency facilities cannot be consistent with our financial stability objectives.\n\nThe issue of the social value created by market-based financial intermediation and appropriate scope and terms associated with a lender of last resort function are complex ones that require further study and analysis.  However, regardless of where we come out on these questions, we must make the basic structure of the wholesale funding market as sound as possible.  Thus, we must push ahead with tri-party and money fund reform. \n\nThank you for your attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n1 I note that the set of issues relating to wholesale funding are closely related to the challenge of ending ”too big to fail” I discussed in a November 15, 2012, speech (see www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2012/dud121115.html). The more stable the sources of funding, the more resilient each firm would be, and the less the failure of any one firm would disrupt the provision of credit to the economy.\n\n2 Banking groups retained a prominent role in credit supply via nonbank affiliates outside the commercial bank.\n\n3 A repo is a sale of securities coupled with an agreement to repurchase the securities at a specified price on a later date.\n\n4 Market makers are institutions such as securities brokers and dealers that buy and sell securities on behalf of customers. Market making accommodates the asynchronous arrival of sellers and buyers, thus providing liquidity to financial markets.\n\n5 Conduits are bankruptcy-remote, special purpose vehicles that fund pools of securities in short-term funding markets. The securities might consist of loans, mortgages, receivables and securitized products such as asset-backed securities (ABS). The securities in asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) conduits serve as collateral for the issuance of asset-backed commercial paper, while repo conduits fund in the repo market. Most conduits are so-called single-seller conduits that only serve individual banks or finance companies. Multi-seller conduits provide funding for asset pools of multiple institutions. Conduits are backed by credit lines from commercial banks, which allow the conduits to have a credit rating. Asset-backed commercial paper conduits are also defined in \"Shadow Banking: A Review of the Literature.\" Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Reports, no. 580, (October) 2011. www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr580.pdf.\n\n6 The problem was particularly acute for those firms with large securities trading and over-the-counter derivative businesses operated outside of depository institutions. In the United States, even those securities firms that were part of bank holding companies were vulnerable because Section 23A restrictions in the Federal Reserve Act that govern transactions between the bank and the nonbank affiliates as part of a bank holding company complex sharply limited what assets the securities firm could pass through to the bank and on to the Fed’s discount window facility.\n\n7 In the unwind, cash was transmitted back from securities firms to wholesale investors each morning, to hopefully be reinvested and returned back to the securities firms by the end of the day to finance their inventories of securities.\n\n8 The new global liquidity standards adopted by the Basel Committee provide a global minimum standard.\n\n9 At the end of 2011, the New York Fed disbanded a private-sector taskforce that had generated some good ideas but was running into trouble on implementation, and adopted a supervisory approach to pushing forward further reform.\n\n10 These estimates are based on data from the clearing banks with analysis by New York Fed staff.\n\n11 OMO eligible is collateral that the Fed can purchase or repo in its open market operations.\n\n12 In addition, because the Federal Reserve is authorized to intervene in the Treasury, agency debt, and agency MBS markets, it could act to stabilize these markets during times of stress. This would make it easier to liquidate such collateral without unduly depressing prices.\n\n13Financial Stability Oversight Council. 2012. \"Proposed Recommendations Regarding Money Market Mutual Fund Reform.\" (November).\nhttp://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/Documents/Proposed%20Recommendations%20Regarding%\n20Money%20Market%20Mutual%20Fund%20Reform%20-%20November%2013,%202012.pdf\n\n14 See William C. Dudley. 2012. \"For Stability’s Sake, Reform Money Funds.\" www.bloomberg.com, August 14. http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-14/for-stability-s-sake-reform-money-funds.html.\n\n15 For a more detailed discussion, see “The Minimum Balance at Risk: A Proposal to Mitigate the Systemic Risks Posed by Money Market”. www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr564.pdf\n\n16 Although the largest stand-alone securities firms adopted bank holding company status during the crisis, their non-depository institution arms do not have access to the discount window backstop because Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act restricts the ability of the holding company to transfer assets from the non-depository institution to the commercial bank affiliate that has access to the discount window.\n\n17 See Daniel K. Tarullo. 2012. \"Industry Structure and Systemic Risk Regulation.\" December 4. http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/tarullo20121204a.htm. In this speech, he explores three policy proposals: (1) breaking up large financial institutions by reinstating Glass-Steagall restrictions or by imposing other prohibitions on affiliations of commercial banks with certain business lines; (2) placing a cap on the nondeposit liabilities of financial institutions; and (3) requiring financial institutions above a specified size to hold minimum amounts of long-term debt available for conversion to equity to avoid or facilitate an orderly resolution of a troubled firm\n\n18 A lender of last resort finances with an appropriate haircut.\n\n19 This was demonstrated recently by the European Central Bank’s Outright Monetary Transactions program\n\n20 Several of the largest broker-dealers adopted bank holding company status in recent years, but Section 23A rules restrict the capacity of their banking subsidiaries to channel liquidity to their broker-dealer operations."

            "content": "In a recent speech1 I talked about a number of the challenges facing the economy as we seek to secure the recovery and build for the future. Today I will focus on one of these: the problems in the U.S. housing market. In focusing today on housing, I would emphasize that this is only one factor behind the frustratingly slow economic recovery. Nevertheless, it is an important one that deserves our attention. As always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe New York Fed is deeply committed to contributing to efforts to resolve the housing crisis that still afflicts our nation. Our economists monitor the housing market and analyze its impact on the national economy. My outreach staff work with community groups and housing practitioners to support local programs that aid distressed homeowners. Our lawyers perform pro-bono work for homeowners facing foreclosure and advise on legal reforms, while our researchers and market analysts have developed proposals to mitigate current problems and improve the future structure of housing finance.\n\nIn my presentation today, I will explain why a more robust housing market matters for the wider economy. I will also highlight those factors specific to the housing market that create a risk that it will linger in an extremely weak state for longer than is necessary and remain vulnerable to further weakness.\n\nI will make the case for further housing-related policy interventions that would help stabilize home prices, improve the housing outlook and generate an earlier recovery in housing activity. I believe such actions would support growth and make monetary policy more effective in promoting the dual mandate given to the Federal Reserve by Congress—maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability.\n\nThe Housing Bust\nGiven the excesses of the housing boom that took place in the early to middle part of the last decade, a substantial downward adjustment in housing was unavoidable. Since peaking in the second quarter of 2006, home prices have fallen by about 30 percent,2 returning to levels that last prevailed in mid-2003. In the states of Arizona, California, Florida and Nevada, where home prices rose much more than the national average, prices have declined by roughly 40 percent. Over the past year, house prices have declined by another 4 percent, though they remained roughly flat, when one excludes distress sales.\n\nHome construction collapsed with new single family starts falling from a peak rate of 1.75 million homes per year to a low of 360,000 in early 2009. After a very slight pick-up, they have been bumping along at about a 425,000 annual rate for over a year.\n\nAlthough the number of mortgages becoming delinquent is off its peak, it remains very elevated and increased in the third quarter of 2011.3 According to the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, at the end of that quarter there were roughly 1.5 million first lien mortgages 90 or more days past due, and 2 million first lien mortgages in some stage of foreclosure.\n\nOver time, without an improvement in housing and the labor market, more loans will become seriously delinquent. Moreover, absent more aggressive efforts to find economically efficient alternatives to foreclosure — loans already seriously delinquent and in foreclosure will become real estate owned by the lender, or REO. My staff estimate that the flow of properties into lender REO in 2012 and 2013 could be as high as 1.8 million per year, up from around 1.1 million in 2011 and around 600,000 in 2010.\n\nThe overhang of properties in the foreclosure/REO pipeline continues to exert downward pressure on house prices and housing activity. Recent surveys by MacroMarkets and by Fannie Mae indicate that households expect negligible gains in home prices over the next few years, with many expecting that prices will continue to decline.\n\nMacroeconomic Consequences\nThe ongoing weakness in housing has made it more difficult to achieve a vigorous economic recovery. Housing has inhibited economic activity through a number of channels.\n\nFirst, the strong rebound in residential investment that typically powers economic recoveries following deep recessions has been absent. For example, nine quarters following the ends of the mid-1970s and early 1980s recessions, residential investment had climbed by 65 percent and 55 percent, respectively, above the level at the corresponding troughs. In contrast, during this cycle, there has been no rebound. In the third quarter of 2011, residential investment was still somewhat below the level in the second quarter of 2009.\n\nSecond, by eroding household wealth, the decline in housing prices has contributed to greater weakness in consumption. For most American households the family home is by far the largest tangible asset, a buffer against misfortune, and often a significant savings vehicle to fund retirement.4 \n\nSince home values peaked in 2006, homeowners have lost more than half their home equity—about $7.3 trillion—and expectations of future gains have also declined. At present roughly 11 million households are in negative equity with the aggregate amount of negative equity estimated to be roughly $700 billion.5 \n\nThird, the weakness in home prices has reduced credit availability. Because the home is the primary source of collateral for most households, financial institutions are less willing to lend when house prices have declined substantially and could fall further. In addition, problems in the foreclosure process and obstacles to efficient modification of loans in securitizations, which I'll describe in a moment, make a house of a given value less attractive as collateral to secure a loan. As a result, as home prices have fallen, financial institutions have tightened lending standards. This has reduced the amount of credit available for households, including for small business formation.\n\nFourth, the big drop in house prices has made it more difficult for borrowers to refinance. This has undercut to a degree the ability of monetary policy to support demand.\n\nTraditionally, refinancing activity has been an important channel through which lower interest rates support spending and employment. Refinancing frees up borrower income. Because those who refinance tend to have a higher marginal propensity to consume from income than the investors receiving the mortgage payments, such refinancing activity increases overall demand. However, the fall in home equity combined with a pro-cyclical tightening of refinancing standards and fees means that many borrowers who would like to refinance cannot do so.\n\nProblems in Housing\nBy many measures—including affordability ratios and price-to-rent ratios—home prices have fallen back to or below their pre-boom levels. Indeed, housing no longer appears overvalued. In many former boom localities, the price of existing homes has fallen below the cost of building a new home.6 Also, after several years of depressed construction the national stock of housing no longer looks excessive relative to the nation's population.\n\nNevertheless, housing currently remains in excess supply, in part, because household formation rates remain depressed.\n\nNormally, when there is excess supply, markets self-correct fairly efficiently. Prices fall until they reach a level at which supply and demand are balanced. Unfortunately, the housing market has a number of specific features that complicate this adjustment process and mean it could undershoot — and remain weaker for longer than is necessary.\n\nHousing is a very long-lived asset. Once new building ceases in stressed markets, further reductions in demand cannot be matched by further supply reductions.7 This means that the market clearing price for housing is highly sensitive to those factors that influence demand.\n\nMoreover, there is a feedback loop from prices to demand, with weaker prices leading to weaker demand. If house prices are anticipated to increase, then the expected capital gain helps to offset the financing cost of owning a home. However, if households believe that house prices could decline further, the expected capital loss adds to the financing cost of owning a home and prospective buyers will be reluctant to buy even if mortgage rates are low.\n\nThat said, it should also be recognized that the factors that affect demand and home prices are not immutable. They depend, in part, on policy choices. Consider, for example, the fact that most home purchases are financed with long-term mortgage credit. This means that the demand for housing is highly sensitive to the availability and cost of that credit.\n\nOutcomes in housing are also affected by the legal and operational infrastructure of the mortgage market. This apparatus has been wholly inadequate for dealing with a systemic shock to housing and employment, and is amplifying bad outcomes. A flawed resolution regime—very different from the more efficient regime for resolving excess debt in private commercial property—exacerbates the risks of under-shooting.\n\nConflicts of interest are embedded in mortgage securitization structures and between first and second lien-holders. There are challenges to how the industry records and transfers interests in these mortgages. For mortgages that are part of securitizations, the legal obstacles to loan modification that preserve value are substantial. Meanwhile, mortgage servicers lack the systems, processes, governance, resources and incentives to deal effectively with a large volume of delinquent borrowers—who often suffer poor customer treatment at a time of personal distress.8 \n\nThe result is inefficiently low levels of mortgage modification, too few \"short sales\" 9 by mutual agreement between distressed borrowers and lenders, and too much reliance on the foreclosure process. This process also has many legal impediments and has become even more inefficient as the volume of loans in the pipeline increases. One consequence has been lengthening delays in completing foreclosures—including unavoidable foreclosures. These delays have increased the economic damage caused by foreclosure and reduced recovery rates.\n\nThe damage caused by inefficient foreclosures is worth emphasizing. It is not just the direct loss of value in terms of deterioration of homes that are ultimately foreclosed. In addition, as I have personally witnessed in my outreach visits across the New York Fed's District, foreclosures impose significant costs on families, surrounding neighborhoods and communities. Unmaintained homes facing foreclosure drag down the value of nearby homes. Also, property taxes on non-foreclosed homes often go up due to a declining tax base and this puts additional downward pressure on housing prices.\n\nForeclosures also undercut housing demand. Households that go through foreclosure need to repair their credit records and to accumulate new downpayments. For several years they are no longer available as potential home buyers and this also contributes to softer demand and weaker housing prices.\n\nFurther declines in home prices also could be reinforcing because they would likely make the already daunting foreclosure/REO pipeline even larger. Currently, households in negative equity or \"underwater\" on their loans owe $65,000 on average more on their mortgages than the value of their homes. Since the recession, most defaults have been by necessity — that is, they have been prompted by a job loss, health problems or divorce coupled with the household being in negative equity. No doubt, however, there is some degree or duration of negative equity that may cause households to conclude that a default is inevitable and should be taken sooner rather than later. If this point were reached, defaults by choice could significantly swell the flow of homes into the foreclosure pipeline.\n\nThe Case for Housing Intervention\nAll these factors imply that there are many potential equilibrium outcomes in terms of housing demand and home prices—some considerably more desirable than others. Negative price expectations and flawed financing and administrative mechanisms, if left unaddressed, can contribute to ongoing weakness in housing demand and make it harder to generate a robust economic recovery.\n\nPersistent weakness in housing is particularly problematic because it acts as a drag on spending and job creation in an environment in which such weakness can not be easily offset by other policy adjustments. Housing policy should seek to break adverse feedback loops, promote more economically efficient outcomes in housing and support growth.\n\nIn recent speeches,10 I have called for a \"comprehensive approach\" to stabilize the national real estate market and lay the foundations for recovery. I believe this should include measures to improve access to mortgage credit, reduce obstacles to refinancing, lessen the flow of homes into foreclosure through bridge financing and accelerated principal reduction, and to facilitate the absorption of REO back into use as owner- or renter- housing.\n\nMany of these policies simply seek to solve or bypass the legal and incentive problems in the market today and mimic efficient private actions that might be taken if mortgage loans were all held in portfolio and accounting rules did not discourage net present value maximization.\n\nOthers seek to solve coordination problems and take account of the externalities or spillovers to generate outcomes that are superior from the broadest perspective of the nation as a whole.\n\nEarlier this week Chairman Bernanke sent members of Congress a thoughtful analysis of housing policy11 by staff at the Board of Governors in Washington that evaluates a number of these same issues. What I would like to do today is to elaborate on some specific proposals we have developed in New York, in order to try to persuade you that there are workable solutions to our housing problems at costs that I deem very reasonable relative to the economically inefficient path we are on. Of course, I am open to other promising alternatives that would address the same issues.\n\nI note also that a truly comprehensive approach would also include long-term reform —including reform of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac—to put housing finance on a more stable footing and to equip the market to deal more effectively with any future systemic shocks.\n\nBut I will not discuss these issues in-depth today.\n\nAccess to Mortgage Credit\nRestoring demand for housing requires new mortgage debt to be offered to creditworthy borrowers on reasonable terms. This is important because residential mortgage lending terms tightened significantly during the crisis, and have not eased subsequently.12\n\nIndeed, over 50 percent of all new loans—and 70 percent of new prime conforming loans—go to borrowers with FICO scores of 760 or above, compared with about 30 percent before the crisis. Borrowers with credit scores of 720 or less now make up less than 30 percent of new originations, although they represent 52 percent of the population with credit scores.\n\nSteps should be taken to improve households' access to credit. Currently, lenders are discouraged from making new prime conforming loans due to excessively stringent put-back rules on these mortgages. Such rules give Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac broad scope to force the originator to repurchase at par loans that go delinquent if there are any errors in the mortgage loan paperwork—even if the error has no direct link to the delinquency.\n\nIt is essential that lenders are accountable for the representations they make and are appropriately penalized for any misrepresentations. However, doing this via a blanket repurchase regime leads to bad outcomes at a time when there is an unusually high risk of job loss leading to delinquency. It would be better to establish alternative ways to penalize lenders for misrepresentation that were not in practice so closely tied to the risk of job loss.13 \n\nThe current repurchase regime exposes lenders originating prime conforming loans to significant credit risk and encourages them to focus only on the lowest-risk customers.\n\nLenders are applying tougher restrictions than the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac formally require in order to limit the risk that they will have to take back such loans when they become delinquent.\n\nFor mortgages guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a better balance between incentives for sound underwriting and credit availability could be achieved by inserting a materiality test in the rep and warranty agreement.\n\nIn the future, it would be worth exploring whether a better regime in general would be to have representations and warranties with a finite duration, but supplemented by a rigorous quality control check of the underwiting based on a random sample of the mortgages as they are being securitized.14\n\nToday's tough underwriting standards and high risk-based premiums for conforming loan borrowers should also be reviewed. I do not want to see a return to the lax standards and underpricing of credit risk of the boom period. But the guarantee fees for new purchase mortgages should be based on the expected losses on these mortgages—not the realized losses on loans of earlier vintages.\n\nThere is also a strong case for tackling the downward bias on appraisals, which are voiding many transactions between willing buyers and willing sellers. Incentives for individual appraisers favor conservatism today—just as they favored over-optimism during the boom.\n\nThis problem is aggravated by the difficulty in establishing benchmark prices in markets with few transactions and a high share of distress sales. The industry could establish appraisal standards that avoid such procylical outcomes.\n\nMortgage Refinancing\nIncreasing refinancing would support the housing market by promoting aggregate demand and employment. Refinancing creates additional cash flow for borrowers to absorb any adverse income shocks and this reduces the likelihood of default, distress sales and foreclosures.\n\nHowever, there are significant obstacles to refinancing in current circumstances. Declines in home equity have been aggravated by tighter standards, high refinancing fees, burdensome administrative processes, and legal risks to the lenders refinancing the loan.\n\nBecause the taxpayer, via Fannie and Freddie, is already exposed to the risk of conforming loans defaulting, it makes no sense to make it expensive or difficult for borrowers with these loans to refinance. After all, refinancing reduces the credit risk to which taxpayers are exposed. It is also inefficient to fully re-underwrite applications for such refinancings. For example, appraisals could be greatly simplified and made less expensive by using automated valuation models.\n\nThe Home Affordable Refinance Program, or HARP, was set up to facilitate refinancing of high loan-to-value prime conforming mortgages. The announced goal of the HARP was to refinance 3 million to 4 million mortgages. However, shortcomings with the original program mean that less than a million HARP refinancings have taken place.\n\nLegal risks discouraged lenders from participating more fully in HARP to date. Notably, if a lender refinanced a loan made by another company, it was liable for the underwriting associated with the original loan. The profit from refinancing was unattractive relative to the risk of being forced to repurchase the loan. Given this, lenders had little incentive to compete to refinance loans and this led to higher mortgage rates and less refinancing.\n\nMany of these issues have been addressed by recent revisions to HARP and related decisions by Fannie Mae, but more could and should be done. Remaining legal issues could be alleviated by harmonizing standards between Fannie and Freddie.\n\nI would like to see refinancing made broadly available on streamlined terms and with moderate fees to all prime conforming borrowers who are current on their payments. This could substantially increase the number of refinancings.\n\nBridge Financing\nTo stabilize the housing market, we also need to weaken the link between unemployment and new foreclosures. The primary reason for distress sales and mortgage defaults today is the loss of a job. Even if it were possible, it would be inefficient for homeowners with mortgages to self-insure against a job loss.\n\nSome support for unemployed homeowners has been provided in some states under the Hardest Hit program. I favor a broad program to provide bridge financing for all qualified borrowers with demonstrated ability to service their debts who become unemployed involuntarily—though categorically not those who quit or are terminated with cause. In economic terms, this is a form of collective insurance.15 \n\nMy staff estimates that there are 4 million to 5 million \"at risk\" homeowners who can afford their mortgage, but who would struggle to make their payments in the event that the primary earner in the household became unemployed.\n\nWith the current weak labor markets, they estimate around 600,000 of these at-risk households will experience an involuntary job loss that lasts longer than a month over the next year. The average annual amount that would be required to keep the mortgage current for these households while unemployed and receiving unemployment insurance is around $21,000. This would be a loan not a grant.16 \n\nThis implies an annual bridge lending program of $15 billion per year during the current stress period. This seems expensive, but this is not the cost of such a program, just the cash outlay in the early years. In the future, loan repayments would help to offset the program cost.\n\nMoreover, when one factors in the reduced negative externalities achieved by limiting distress sales, the expected program cost would be even lower.\n\nOf course, any bridge financing loans would need to be properly secured in order to protect taxpayers interests. In situations in which the value of the loan already exceeded the value of the home, it might be appropriate to require lenders to write down the excess debt as a condition for the borrower obtaining a bridge loan. This would ensure that the bridging funds did not \"bail out\" the lender. Writing down excess debt would likely be in the lender's rational self-interest given the borrower's situation, since a distress sale or foreclosure at current market prices would generally yield larger losses.\n\nEarned Principal Reduction\nInvestment firms that purchase delinquent mortgages routinely reduce principal in order to maximize value on these loans. It would make sense for Fannie and Freddie to do this as well in order to minimize loss of value on the delinquent loans they guarantee.\n\nHowever, I am uncomfortable with the notion that \"underwater\" borrowers who owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth should have to go delinquent before they have a chance of securing a reduction in their mortgage debt. I believe we should also develop a program for earned principal reduction for borrowers who are underwater but keep on making their mortgage payments. Such a program would strengthen the incentives for mortgage holders who are underwater to continue to stay current on their loans, and reduce the likely number of defaults and REO sales.\n\nNegative equity is one of the most significant predictors of mortgage default across all types of mortgage products, including when you control for credit scores and level of income documentation. While recent underwater borrowers have not been defaulting at a rapid pace, they are also not prepaying, implying that underwater mortgages remain \"at risk\" for a prolonged period of time to any adverse shock to the borrower.\n\nIt is admittedly challenging to predict how underwater borrowers will ultimately perform and this performance will be sensitive to the path of home prices. Nonetheless, analysis by my staff that looks at likely borrower behavior over an extended time horizon suggests that without a significant turnaround in home prices and employment, a substantial proportion of those loans that are deeply underwater will ultimately default — absent an earned principal reduction program.\n\nOne option developed by my staff is for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to give underwater borrowers on loans that they have guaranteed the right to pay off the loan at below par in the future under certain circumstances, including that the borrowers have continued to make timely payments. For instance, the borrower could be given an open-ended option to pay off the loan at an LTV of 125 percent, and the right to pay off the loan at an LTV of 95 percent after three years of timely payments.\n\nThe borrower would be protected from further declines in home prices, but in return would give up a portion of any upside from future capital gains on the home via a shared appreciation agreement. Note that under this arrangement some of the reduction in the loan amount would be paid by the borrower as the outstanding balance was amortized by continued monthly payments.\n\nREO Portfolio\nEven with aggressive policies to minimize the flow of loans into foreclosure, my staff estimates that large volumes of properties would still flow into lenders' REO over the next few years. This growing overhang could continue to depress prices.\n\nThus, along with more incentives to promote short sales, steps should be taken to facilitate the timely and orderly absorption of these properties back into the market including as renter-occupied housing. An interagency group including the Federal Reserve is working on issues relating to REO-to-rental conversions. Appropriate policies would simultaneously lessen downward pressure on home prices and upward pressure on rents.\n\nAmong other steps, investors could be encouraged to purchase REO to be made available as rental housing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could increase the number of loans offered to individual investors, provided the investor puts up an adequate amount of equity for each mortgage. And REO properties in a given locality could be bundled for sale.\n\nThe government might consider a package of tax incentives for purchases of REO that are used as rental properties. Such incentives might include a reduction of the current 27½ year depreciation period and/or a reduction of capital gains tax liability if the property is held for a minimum period, such as five years.\n\nOne idea developed by my staff—let's call it \"homes for heros\"—would be to create a new tax credit or other home purchase subsidy specifically for veterans of our foreign wars that would enable these veterans to purchase such properties at a discount. There are over 2½ million Gulf War II veterans alone, many of whom served multiple tours of duty overseas, and a significant proportion of them might otherwise not be able to purchase homes today.\n\nOur nation owes them a great debt, and such a policy would provide a boost to housing demand quickly.\n\nMoral Hazard\nSome argue that any interventions to improve the real estate market would lead to moral hazard—that is these intervention would reward bad behaviors. I think these concerns are overstated. First, the programs that have been proposed can be designed with the proper incentives to limit moral hazard and to encourage desireable behavior.\n\nSecond, in contrast to the earlier phase of housing crisis when mostly subprime borrowers came under stress, many of the borrowers running into trouble with their mortgages today took out conforming loans subject to standard downpayment requirements, had respectable FICO scores and borrowed a moderate amount to finance an average house. The problem was that these purchases occurred near the peak in the market and now many of the buyers have suffered an adverse life shock such as unemployment or illness. This isn't a moral hazard issue, this is just the bad luck associated with the timing of the purchase and an exceptionally weak jobs market. Punishing such misfortune accomplishes little.\n\nThe Taxpayer Interest\nI believe that the proposals I put forward are strongly in the public interest. I also believe that they would be good for taxpayers. Consider, for instance, the proposal for earned principal reduction. While this would certainly involve outlays, these would be offset by reduced defaults. Whether there is a net cost or not depends on the reduction in the default rate that would come with principal reduction and how this reduction would affect the performance of the overall housing market and the economy.\n\nBased on recent data on borrower behavior,17 my staff calculates that the taxpayer (through the effect on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) would be better off with earned principal reduction under a base case of roughly flat house prices and persistent weakness in the jobs market. Under a scenario of modest house price increases, the combination of fewer defaults and shared appreciation also produces a net benefit.\n\nThis result occurs before taking into account the positive externalities of nudging house prices onto a stronger path, which would reduce the magnitude of losses on loans that do default. On an expected value basis, such a program appears still more compelling, since Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are currently exposed to the downside risk of further declines in home prices.\n\nOf course, just focusing on the impact on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is much too narrow even from a taxpayer perspective. If you believe as I do that improving the outlook for housing would materially strengthen the over economy, one must also include the fiscal benefits generated by stronger economic growth.\n\nHousing Policy and Monetary Policy\nIn closing, the housing policy agenda I describe would address one factor that has impeded the economic recovery. Implementing such policies would improve the economic outlook and make monetary accommodation more effective.\n\nHowever, because the outlook for unemployment is unacceptably high relative to our dual mandate and the outlook for inflation is moderate, I believe it is also appropriate to continue to evaluate whether we could provide additional accommodation in a manner that produces more benefits than costs, regardless of whether action in housing is undertaken or not.\n\nMonetary policy and housing policy are much more complements than substitutes.\n\nAs I hope I have convinced you today, while the Fed has will do all it can to achieve our dual mandate of maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability, we have to recognize that there is more to economic policy than just monetary policy. Low interest rates help housing, but cannot resolve the problems in that sector that are pressing on wider economic activity. With additional housing policy interventions, we could achieve a better set of economic outcomes than with just monetary policy alone.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n___________________________________________________\n1 William C.

            "content": "Good morning and welcome once again to the New York Fed's Quarterly Regional Economic Press Briefing. I am pleased to have this opportunity to talk with the journalists covering our region—and through you, to the people in our District. This morning I will discuss national and regional economic conditions, with particular attention to household debt in the nation and especially in the Second Federal Reserve District, which covers New York; northern New Jersey; Fairfield County, Connecticut; Puerto Rico; and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Following my remarks, my colleagues will provide more detail. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nNational Economic Conditions\nTo provide context, let me first comment on national economic conditions. Since the Great Recession ended in 2009, the economy has grown at a modest pace. When we last met, in October, the available data showed that we hit a soft patch at mid-year. The recovery had slowed, extending the time before employment and inflation could be expected to return to levels consistent with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. And, with the loss of economic momentum, downside risks had increased.\n\nIn order to foster greater economic momentum, reduce downside risks and speed up the return to more normal levels of unemployment and inflation, in early November the Federal Reserve announced its intention to purchase $600 billion of Treasury securities. These purchases helped to ease financial conditions, thereby stimulating economic activity.\n\nMore recently, we have seen signs of a pick-up in the pace of growth, with activity in the second half of 2010 turning out to be considerably stronger than most analysts expected. Real final sales grew at a 4 percent annual rate over the second half of 2010, up from 1 percent over the first half, led by surprisingly strong growth of consumer spending, continued strong growth of exports and slower but still healthy growth of business fixed investment.\n\nSeveral notable forces combined to encourage the resumption of stronger growth. On the policy side, as I mentioned, the Federal Open Market Committee provided further stimulus through purchasing Treasury securities. This, plus the lagged effects of its previous measures, helped to improve financial conditions. Also, the Board of Governors' Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey indicates that, while the absolute level of lending standards remains tight, banks did begin to ease standards somewhat in the second half of 2010.\n\nThe pick-up in the economy has occurred despite renewed weakness in the housing market. Home prices have softened anew and construction activity remains stuck at a very low level, likely reflecting the continued large supply of unsold homes. We believe that it will take more time, perhaps as much as another year, for enough of these homes to be bought that residential construction might begin a meaningful recovery.\n\nOn the labor front, the most recent employment report for January 2011 is quite difficult to interpret. Only 36,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added, well below expectations. Yet, we get a very different perspective from the unemployment rate, which fell by 0.4 percentage points for the second month in a row and now stands at 9.0 percent. Job growth was undoubtedly held down by the severe winter storms that affected many major cities, including our own. The decline in the jobless rate was not an unmitigated positive, as a significant part of this decline was due to fewer people looking for work.\n\nThus, neither the disappointingly slow job growth nor the welcome steep drop in unemployment seems to paint the full picture. The truth lies somewhere in between. Despite the stronger job growth that we expect in the months ahead, we will continue to have a substantial amount of slack in our labor markets that will take time to absorb.\n\nAt this point, while the soft patch is over and the risk of a double dip has subsided, the economy still faces headwinds as a result of the aftermath of the financial crisis, the housing bust and the high level of unemployment that still prevails. As banks and other financial institutions seek to strengthen their balance sheets and avoid future credit losses, they may keep credit conditions tighter than normal. In addition, many consumers' borrowing options may be limited by their impaired credit histories, and the recovery is not getting the strong boost from home construction that most previous recoveries have benefited from. Furthermore, as I will discuss later, households are still feeling the financial impact of lost wealth and jobs, which makes some cautious about spending and investing.\n\nThe economy is healthier, but it is not yet well. In order to reduce joblessness significantly over the coming quarters, the economy needs to grow at a considerably faster rate than we have seen so far in this recovery.\n\nI am happy to say that we believe that conditions are in place for such higher growth in 2011 and 2012. We entered this year with a fair amount of momentum. Business and household spending has strengthened, presumably reflecting greater confidence in the economic outlook and progress in the repair of household balance sheets. Businesses are expanding their investments in equipment and software at a healthy pace. And, their spending on nonresidential structures, such as office and factory space is no longer contracting as sharply as it was a year ago. Further support comes from the agreement by Congress and the administration to postpone some tax increases, to reduce payroll taxes temporarily and to extend unemployment benefits. In addition, our exports continue to expand, supported by strength in demand abroad, particularly in Asia.\n\nHigher growth, a steady reduction in spare capacity in the economy and continued stability in inflation expectations should also slowly begin to reverse the recent decline in core inflation. Inflation was quite low during the second half of 2010, but we expect that to be the low point of the cycle.\n\nIn short, viewed through the lens of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate—the pursuit of the highest level of employment consistent with price stability—the current situation remains unsatisfactory. However, we appear now to be moving in the right direction.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions (update since the October regional press briefing)\nNow, how is our region doing? Overall—in contrast to the pick-up in the nation—the regional economic recovery appears to have paused in the fourth quarter. More similar to the nation, joblessness in the region has retreated somewhat from the peaks recorded toward the end of 2009, but remains unacceptably high.\n\nAs attendees at previous regional press briefings may recall, the New York Fed produces Indexes of Coincident Economic Indicators to help monitor the performance of the regional economy.\n\nBased on these measures, the upturn in economic activity that we saw for much of 2010 in both New York State and New York City has paused. To be sure, activity in both the state and the city is higher than a year ago, but we saw no increase over the prior quarter. This pause is particularly evident in New York City where the economic recovery had been relatively strong. By the way, let me note that this pause occurred before mid-December, so it cannot be attributed to the recent spate of heavy snow storms.\n\nBy contrast, New Jersey's economy has seen no pick-up in activity and, in fact, activity there continued to decline at a modest pace through the end of 2010.\n\nWe monitor Puerto Rico using an index produced by the Government Development Bank of Puerto Rico. This index shows that the recession there, which started back in 2005—well before that experienced in the mainland—appears to have subsided. As of November of last year, activity was no longer falling, although indications of a recovery are still mixed.\n\nTurning to jobs, the latest data indicate that businesses in the region, on balance, were not expanding their workforces at the end of last year. As a result, the total number of jobs in the region has held steady, lagging behind the job growth rate experienced nationally.\n\nMuch of this recent weakness in employment stems from job losses in the retail, wholesale and manufacturing sectors in our region. In the rest of the nation, these sectors expanded during the last quarter. Moreover, our state and local governments cut jobs much more severely than governments did elsewhere.\n\nAt the same time, job gains in some of the region's strongest sectors—professional and business services, finance, education and health—were not large enough to completely offset these losses. At this point, it is difficult to say whether the recent pause in job growth is short-lived or not. As such, we will continue to closely monitor our region's job situation.\n\nMeanwhile, unemployment rates have ticked down across the region. Given the disappointing job numbers, it is not surprising that this change is largely due to a decline in labor force participation. In the fourth quarter of 2010, the labor force of both New York and New Jersey declined by about 0.3 percentage points, meaning that fewer people were actively seeking work. December's unemployment rate in New York and New Jersey, at 8.2 percent and 9.1 percent, respectively, were below the national jobless rate of 9.4 percent for that month, though these rates remain painfully high. Puerto Rico's 15.7 percent unemployment rate, although down from its high of over 17 percent, still shows little evidence of a sustained improvement.\n\nOverview of Household Debt during the Crisis\nNow, let me turn to this session's special topic: household debt. This topic provides an important lens into economic conditions in our country and our region. How families are adjusting their saving, borrowing and spending in the aftermath the mortgage crisis and the Great Recession will help shape the path of the recovery.\n\nHere at the Federal Reserve, we try to answer questions such as: what is happening to households' credit, debt and delinquencies and what economic consequences will that have? This monitoring and research on household debt and credit conditions helps us better understand the connections between financial market developments, the broader economy and families' well-being. We follow a variety of metrics, including lending activity, the level of interest rates and of interest rate spreads, survey data on lending standards, delinquency rates on loans, and home and other asset price changes.\n\nOne new, key source of information on household debt and credit conditions is the New York Fed's Consumer Credit Panel. As you heard a few moments ago, these data are now available for all of 2010. They come from a nationwide sample covering all households where at least one member has a credit report. The records tell us about five major categories of household debt—mortgages, home equity lines of credit, and credit card, auto and student loans.\n\nTo set the stage, one can think about the recent path of household debt in three phases.\n\nThe nature of the run-up to the crisis has been well-documented, so let me focus here on the latter two phases: the crisis and convalescence.\n\nDuring the crisis, weakness in the housing market contributed to financial strains as many families found that their mortgages were \"underwater,\" that is, their homes were now worth less than their mortgage balances. As a result, they had no financial buffer they could tap if their finances came under stress. And, as the economy weakened further, many households faced sharply reduced incomes as family members lost their jobs or had their work hours cut. So, more families found it difficult to pay their credit card bills and other debt obligations on time.\n\nAs a consequence of these strains, households began the painful process of deleveraging. They started reducing the amount of debt they owed, relative to their income. During the run-up to the recession, households were saving only about 2 percent of their income; now they are saving around 6 percent of their incomes. This increase in saving was mostly used to pay down their debts, but it also included adding to their savings accounts and borrowing less. Of course some of the reduction in debt reflects loan charge-offs of bad debts. But work done here with the Consumer Credit Panel shows that some consumers also became more frugal, rebuilding their net wealth by paying down their debts. These actions enabled families to rebuild their financial reserves—precautionary funds that could be used in the event of a job loss or illness—to maintain their consumption and keep up with their mortgage payments. But to save more, it also means that they had to consume less, which dampened economic activity further.\n\nInterestingly, student loans are the only part of household debt that continued to rise throughout the crisis. More families and students may have needed to rely on loans to fund education during the difficult times. And going to school was more attractive for some, given the deterioration in labor market conditions.\n\nJust as households began deleveraging during the crisis, banks needed to respond in light of the large loan losses that they were taking. As defaults rose, banks tightened their underwriting standards and raised the margins that they charged on loans. As a consequence, they made fewer loans. This tightening of credit availability exacerbated the decline in real activity. It created an \"adverse feedback loop\" between the financial and real sectors of the economy that deepened the recession.\n\nWhere are we now?\nThere are several signs that we are now convalescing; this damaging dynamic—the adverse feedback loop—now appears to be reversing. From historical experience with financial crises we know that this phase is a gradual transition process—not a quick event—as households and banks slowly complete their painful adjustments. Once the adjustments are completed, households can consume more and regain their access to credit, and these developments help to support a more vigorous economic recovery.\n\nOf course, we don't yet know precisely where we are in this adjustment process. For example, families may choose a permanently higher rate of saving in order to rebuild their retirement savings. What they decide to do will depend in part on their expectations for future income, their outlook for the economy, what they think will happen to housing and stock prices, and prospects for taxes and benefits such as social security and Medicare payments. However, we do know that during good times few households are likely to be delinquent on their bills. And, overall, we'd expect their borrowing to grow at least modestly as the economy strengthens.\n\nThe Household Debt and Credit Report released today indicates that there has been a pick-up in credit flows. Households increased their non-mortgage debt last quarter, a development not seen since the fourth quarter of 2008. The number of credit card applications increased—an indication of a pick-up in consumer demand for credit. And, the number of open credit card accounts also increased slightly—as more accounts were opened than were closed. Of course, signs of distress continued: households are still reducing their housing-related debt and delinquencies continue to be a problem. So, the adjustments remain far from complete.\n\nIt is encouraging that credit flows are no longer contracting because households' renewed demand for credit has no doubt supported some of the recent rise in consumer spending.\n\nTrends in Household Debt in the Region\nOne key question we'll address today is how this process is playing out for households in our region. In general, our region has fared well in comparison to the nation as a whole. Following the three phases of the cycle that I noted for the nation, I will consider three questions:\n\nOne reason that households in our region have weathered this credit cycle relatively well is that debt levels are lower relative to income and this debt rose more modestly in the run-up to recession than in the nation as a whole. Using the debt-to-income ratio to help us make meaningful comparisons across different geographies, debt levels are particularly low in upstate New York and New York City. Three key exceptions to this generalization are Long Island, Edison, New Jersey and Puerto Rico, where household debt-to-income ratios have risen to levels above the U.S. average.\n\nSince the vast majority of household debt is related to housing, it is not surprising that debt-to-income ratios were highest and rose most in places that experienced rapid rises in home prices. So, for example, debt-to-income ratios are among the highest in the nation in those places most associated with the housing bubble, such as California, Florida, Nevada and Arizona.\n\nThis relationship can also be seen within our region. For example, household debt grew more slowly than nationally and has remained relatively low in upstate New York, which was largely bypassed by the housing boom. The key exception is New York City, where a large share of residents rent their homes. Overall, city residents still have relatively low levels of mortgage debt, even though these debt levels rose during the run-up to the recession. Elsewhere in the region, debt levels tended to rise most in places where housing prices increased the most, such as Long Island and parts of New Jersey.\n\nDuring the crisis, in most parts of our region, households reduced their debts. But, because they had not accumulated as much during the run-up, the decline was well below the national average. In general, households in our region—with some exceptions that I will mention in a moment—have not been under as much pressure to deleverage. It's particularly notable that in upstate New York, where debt levels are well below the national level, households have actually continued to very slowly add to their debt. Clearly, deleveraging has not been particularly consequential for many upstate New York households. The deleveraging process in other parts of New York and New Jersey, while quite severe by historic standards, has proved milder than elsewhere in the nation.\n\nNevertheless, many families in the region have had to make painful adjustments to their spending in order to pay down debts. These families tend to be concentrated in neighborhoods where households took on more debt during the run-up or sustained more severe income losses during the crisis. These factors contribute to delinquency rates that run well above average in certain areas, including certain parts of New York City and Long Island. In fact, some neighborhoods in these areas now have delinquency rates two to three times the national rate.\n\nLooking forward, we see some signs that the region is turning the corner on the credit cycle. After declining during the crisis, credit applications have begun to increase, suggesting that the demand for credit is rising. Although housing debt is still declining and delinquencies are still high, households in many parts of the region have sought and taken on some new debt in recent months. In particular, auto debt has been rising over the past year across New York, northern New Jersey and Puerto Rico—a signal that households in the region once again want to increase spending on durable goods, and are willing and able to borrow to do so.\n\nConclusion\nTo sum up, although the national economy experienced a pick-up in activity during the last quarter of 2010, the region saw a pause. The loss of momentum locally is disappointing because until the fourth quarter, much of the region was recovering somewhat faster than the nation. However, I would not be overly discouraged by this. After all, soft patches are not uncommon during economic recoveries. Both nationally and regionally, unemployment remains stubbornly high, but many indicators suggest that conditions are in place for stronger growth in the coming months.\n\nWith respect to debt, households in most parts of the region are in better shape than the nation as a whole. They increased their debt burdens less during the boom and thus have had less need to deleverage. In addition, there are emerging signs both nationally and regionally that consumers have begun to spend more and appear willing to take on some new debt. This bodes well for another step forward in terms of economic momentum in the nation and the region. However, high delinquencies in New York City and Long Island are a reminder that many households remain under significant stress."

            "href": null,
            "content": "In my opinion, this crisis demonstrated that a systemic risk oversight framework is needed to foster financial stability. The financial system is simply too complex for siloed regulators to see the entire field of play, to prevent the movement of financial activity to areas where there are regulatory gaps, and, when there are difficulties, to communicate and coordinate all responses in a timely and effective manner.\n\nEffective systemic oversight requires two elements. First, the financial system needs to be evaluated in its entirety because, as we have seen, developments in one area can often have devastating consequences elsewhere. In particular, three broad areas of the financial system need to be continuously evaluated: large systemically important financial institutions, payments and settlement systems and the capital markets. The linkages between each must be understood and monitored on a real-time basis. Second, effective systemic risk oversight will require a broad range of expertise. This requires the right people, with experience operating in all the important areas of the financial system.\n\nIn this regard, I believe that the Federal Reserve has an essential role to play. The Federal Reserve has experience and expertise in all three areas—it now oversees most of the largest U.S. financial institutions; it operates a major payments system and oversees several others; and it operates in the capital markets every day in managing its own portfolio and as an agent conducting Treasury securities auctions. Also, as the central bank, it backstops the financial system in its lender-of-last-resort role.\n\nCompared with where we were in late 2008 and early 2009, financial markets have stabilized, and the prospect of a collapse of the financial system and a second Great Depression now seems extremely remote. Even with this progress, however, credit remains tight, especially for small businesses and households. Economic growth has resumed, but unemployment has climbed to punishing levels. So while circumstances have improved, they are still very far from where we want them to be. We have no cause for celebration when the challenges facing so many businesses and households remain so daunting.\n\nAggressive and extraordinary official interventions were imperative to bring about this nascent stabilization of our financial markets and economic recovery. The Federal Reserve has been at the center of many of these interventions. For example, its efforts over the past two years to promote market functioning and minimize contagion were critical in preventing the strains in our financial markets from resulting in even more severe damage to the economy. These “lender of last resort” interventions on the part of the Fed, including facilities such as the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) and the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), as well as programs such as the foreign exchange reciprocal currency agreements, are examples of the rapid and responsive application of basic central bank tenants to the unique challenges we faced as this crisis evolved. Indeed, in many ways, the crisis has underscored why the Federal Reserve was created almost a century ago: to provide a backstop for a banking system prone to runs and financial panics.\n\nWhere it proved necessary and feasible to do so, the Fed also used its emergency lending authority to forestall the disorderly failure of systemically important institutions. These actions truly were extraordinary—well outside the scope of our normal operations, but our judgment was that not taking those actions would have risked a broader collapse of the financial system and a significantly deeper and more protracted recession. Faced with the choice between these otherwise unpalatable actions and a broader systemic collapse, the Fed, with the full support of the Treasury, invoked its emergency lending authority and prevented the collapse of certain institutions previously considered to have been outside the safety net.\n\nThe fact that the Fed needed to take those actions provides a stark illustration of the significant gaps in our regulatory structure, gaps that must be eliminated. Among those holes was the absence of effective consolidated oversight of certain large and deeply interconnected firms; the collective failure of regulators—including the Federal Reserve—to appreciate the linkages and amplification mechanisms embedded in our financial system; and the absence of a resolution process that would allow even the largest and most complex of financial institutions to fail without imperiling the flow of credit to the economy more broadly. Addressing these shortcomings will require important reforms in our country's regulatory architecture.\n\nWe entered the crisis with an obsolete regulatory system. For one, our regulatory system was not structured for a world in which an increasingly large amount of credit intermediation was occurring in nonbank financial institutions. As a result, little attention was paid to the systemic implications of the actions of a large number of increasingly important financial institutions—including securities firms, insurance conglomerates and monolines. In addition, many large financial organizations were funding themselves through market-based mechanisms such as tri-party repo. This made the system as a whole much more fragile and vulnerable to runs when confidence faltered.\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that the Fed and other regulators, here and abroad, did not sufficiently understand the importance of some of these changes in our financial system. We did not see some of the critical vulnerabilities these changes had created, including the large number of self-amplifying mechanisms that were embedded in the system. Nor were all the ramifications of the growth in the intermediation of credit by the nonbank or “shadow banking” system appreciated and their linkages back to regulated financial institutions understood until after the crisis began.\n\nWith hindsight, the regulatory community undoubtedly should have raised the alarm sooner and done more to address the vulnerabilities facing our banks and our entire financial system. But this was difficult because our country didn’t have truly systemic oversight—oversight that would be better suited to the new world in which markets and nonbank financial institutions had become much more important in how credit was intermediated. Without a truly systemic perspective, it was unlikely that any regulator would have been able to understand how the risks were building up in our contemporary, market-based system. The problem was that both banking and nonbank organizations played an important role in credit intermediation but were subject to differing degrees of regulation and supervision by different regulatory authorities.\n\nAlthough these gaps had existed for years, their consequences were not apparent until the crisis. Difficulties in one part of the system quickly exposed hidden vulnerabilities in other parts of the system, in a way that our patchwork regulatory system had not been designed to detect or readily address. In the same way, the crisis revealed the critical deficiencies in the toolkits available to the regulators to deal with nonbank institutions in duress. Emergency lending by the Fed might be enough to forestall the disorderly failure of a systemically important institution and all the wider damage such a failure might cause, but it was a blunt and messy solution, employed as a stopgap measure because better alternatives were not available. What is needed—what our country still lacks—is a large-firm resolution process that would allow for the orderly failure even of a systemically important institution.\n\nThus, in the fall of 2008, regulators and policymakers found themselves facing the prospect of the total collapse of a complex and interconnected system. It was these circumstances, and the prospect they created for an even deeper and more protracted downturn in real economic activity and employment, that required truly extraordinary actions on the part of the Federal Reserve, as well as the Treasury and many other agencies. This is a situation in which the United States must never again find itself.\n\nFor its part, the Federal Reserve is hard at work on developing and implementing new regulations and policy guidance that take on broad lessons of the recent crisis. We are working with other banking regulators in the United States and overseas to strengthen bank capital standards, both by raising the required level of capital where appropriate and improving the risk capture of our standards. We are issuing new guidelines on compensation practices so that financial sector employees are rewarded for long-term performance and discouraged from excessive risk-taking. And we are working with foreign regulators to develop more robust international standards for bank liquidity. We are working to make the tri-party repo system more robust and reducing settlement risk by facilitating the settlement of over-the-counter derivatives trades on central counterparties (CCPs). But more needs to be done and much of this requires action by Congress.\n\nCongress is now considering several proposals for comprehensive regulatory reform, proposals that merit careful study and debate. Let me offer some general thoughts on the principles that should guide how we approach reform.\n\nFirst, it's important to take a clear-eyed and comprehensive view of the financial system we have today. As I've already suggested, if there is one overriding lesson to be drawn from the events of the past 18 months, it is that the financial system is just that: a system, and a very complex one at that. The operational, liquidity and credit interdependencies that characterize contemporary financial markets and institutions mean that the well-being of any one segment of the system is inextricably linked to the well-being of the system as a whole. Because of this, our approach to reform must be guided by a coherent sense of the system as a whole, not merely by a focus on some of its component parts, as important as they may be.\n\nWe need a new regulatory structure that provides for comprehensive and consistent oversight of all elements of the financial system. This includes effective consolidated oversight of all our largest and interconnected financial institutions and oversight of payment and settlement systems. We must make sure that the people doing the regulation have the power and expertise to ferret out and bring to heel regulatory evasion as it occurs to prevent abuse and excess from building up in the financial system. In the end, the gaps, not the overlaps, have been the main shortcoming of our existing regulatory framework.\n\nA second fundamental point is that regulatory reform has to ensure that the financial system will be robust and resilient even when it comes under stress so that it will not fail in its critical role in supporting economic activity. No economy can prosper without a well-functioning financial system—one that efficiently channels savings to the businesses that can make the most productive use of those savings, and to consumers that need credit to buy a home and support a family. The fact that our financial system isn't functioning well right now is part and parcel of our current economic difficulties. This critical link between the “real” and the “financial” is why we care so much about the systemic risks inherent in banking and finance.\n\nOne critical element of systemic risk is what is known as the “too big to fail” problem. Without sufficiently high capital and liquidity standards, and, as a backstop, a resolution mechanism that is credible, regulators are faced with a Hobson’s Choice when a large, systemically important financial firm encounters difficulties. On the one hand, if authorities step in to respond to prevent failure, contagion and collapse of the broader system, that action rewards the imprudent and can create moral hazard—that is, encouraging others to act irresponsibly or recklessly in the future in the belief that they will also be rescued or “bailed out.” On the other hand, if authorities do nothing and let market discipline run its course, they run the risk that the problem will spread and unleash a chain reaction of collapse, with severe and lasting damage to markets, to households and to businesses.\n\nSo what can we do about the “too big to fail” problem? It is clear that we must develop a truly robust resolution mechanism that allows for the orderly wind-down of a failing institution and that limits the contagion to the broader financial system. This will require not only legislative action domestically but intensive work internationally to address a range of legal issues involved in winding down a major global firm. Second, we need to ensure that the payments and settlement systems are robust and resilient. By strengthening financial market infrastructures, we can reduce the risk that shocks in one part of the system will spread elsewhere. Third, we need to reduce the likelihood that systemically important institutions will come close to failure in the first place. This can be done by mandating more robust capital requirements and greater liquidity buffers, as well as aligning compensation with the risks that are taken by the firm’s employees. In addition, instruments such as contingent capital–debt that would automatically convert to equity in adverse environments–need to be considered. Such instruments would enable equity capital to be replenished automatically during stress environments, dampening shocks rather than exacerbating them.\n\nI would now like to take some time to discuss some of the proposals that Congress is debating regarding regulatory reform. As Congress and the Administration consider what legislative changes are warranted, the Federal Reserve's actions before and during the crisis have been getting close inspection. Given the Federal Reserve's key role in our financial system, and the scale of the damage caused by the financial crisis, this careful scrutiny is necessary, appropriate and welcome.\n\nNot surprisingly, there are legislative proposals that would significantly alter the Federal Reserve's powers and responsibilities, particularly with respect to supervision of bank holding companies. Again, that's entirely within Congress's purview: the Federal Reserve only has the powers and responsibilities that Congress has entrusted to us. But in drawing up new legislation, it's important not to throw the baby out with the bathwater—we should preserve what has worked and fix what hasn’t. A dispassionate analysis of what is needed will almost certainly lead to better decisions and a more effective regulatory framework.\n\nThe legislative proposals concerning the Federal Reserve are not limited to the Federal Reserve’s role in supervision. Consider, for example, one proposal that calls for what it terms \"audits\" of the Federal Reserve by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), an arm of Congress. These wouldn't be audits at all in the commonly understood sense of the term. The Federal Reserve's financial books and transactions are already audited by wide range of professionals internal and external to the institution. Rather, these new audits would involve ex-post review of Federal Reserve monetary policy decisions, a potential first step toward the politicization of a process that Congress has carefully sought to insulate from political pressures.\n\nThe notion that the Federal Reserve's financial dealings are somehow kept hidden from the public is a surprisingly widely held view—and it is simply incorrect. An independent outside audit of the Federal Reserve's books is conducted annually. You can find the results online, including a detailed accounting of the Federal Reserve's income and operating expenses in its annual report. The financial books of the regional Federal Reserve Banks also undergo independent outside audits, also available online. In addition, the GAO is empowered to review almost all Federal Reserve activities other than the conduct of monetary policy, including the Federal Reserve's financial operations, which the GAO has done so frequently. The Federal Reserve's balance sheet is posted online weekly, with considerable detail, in what's called the H.4.1 report. Finally, an additional accounting of the Federal Reserve's emergency lending programs created over the last two years is available online in a monthly report.\n\nBut my objection that GAO oversight would be broadened to include a review of monetary policy decisions is not based just on the fact that the Fed is already subject to considerable oversight. My principal concern is the damage that could potentially result to the Fed’s ability to achieve its mandate of price stability and maximum sustainable employment. The effectiveness of monetary policy depends most of all on the Federal Reserve’s credibility with market participants and investors. In particular, both groups need to know that the Fed will always act to keep inflation in check. That's why Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin famously joked that the Fed would sometimes need \"to take the punchbowl away just as the party gets going.\" As you can well imagine, this may not always enhance our popularity, especially among those who were enjoying the party. But, the fact that markets know that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy when needed helps keep inflation expectations in check. This, in turn, helps keep inflation low since inflation expectations affect actual inflation. The consequence is credibility with respect to the conduct of monetary policy. This gives the Fed more latitude not to tighten when inflation rises for transient reasons—say, due to a short-lived spike in oil prices—and more scope to ease credit to support the economy during economic downturns.\n\nRecognizing these benefits, Congress wisely acted many years ago to exempt monetary policy decisions from the GAO's wide powers to review Federal Reserve activities. Congress' decision to bolster the Fed's monetary policy independence has been followed by similar actions around the world—substantial independence for the central bank in the conduct of monetary policy is now widely regarded as international best practice. Policy independence does not absolve the Federal Reserve from accountability for its monetary policy decisions and the need to clearly explain why they were taken. But it avoids the politicization of monetary policy decision-making. And this is good because politicized central banks generally do not have enviable records with regard to inflation, economic growth or currency stability. Risk premia on financial assets are typically much higher in countries with politicized central banks.\n\nOf course, a reversal of Congress's earlier decision would not amount to legislative control over monetary policy decisions. That's not the issue. The issue is that a reversal of Congress’ earlier decision could create the appearance that the legislature seeks to influence monetary policy decisions by establishing a mechanism to publicly second guess those decisions. Such a move would blur what has been a careful separation of monetary policy from politics. Market confidence here and abroad in the Federal Reserve would be undermined. Asset prices could quickly build in an added risk premium, which might lead to tighter credit conditions. These unintended consequences would undermine the legislation’s intent.\n\nI’m also concerned about those proposals under consideration that would move the regulatory and supervisory functions now held by the Federal Reserve to other agencies, new or existing. At present, the Federal Reserve is the consolidated supervisor for bank holding companies, a group that has expanded recently as investment banks and other companies formerly outside the Federal Reserve's purview have been brought under Federal Reserve oversight. In my view, further disaggregation or fragmentation of regulatory oversight responsibility is not the appropriate response to our increasingly interconnected, interdependent financial system. Funneling information streams into diverse institutional silos leads to communication breakdowns and too often to failure to \"connect the dots.\"\n\nIn addition, there are clear synergies between the supervisory process and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy and financial stability missions. The information we collect as part of the supervisory process gives us a front-line, real-time view of the state of the financial industry and broader economy. Monetary policy is more informed as a result. Only with this knowledge can a central bank understand how the monetary policy impulse will be propagated through the financial system and affect the real economy.\n\nSimilarly, involvement in the supervisory process gives us critical information in fulfilling our lender-of-last-resort responsibilities. Information sharing with other agencies is simply not as good as the intimate knowledge and understanding of markets and institutions that is gathered from first-hand supervision. Indeed, many institutions at the center of the crisis and arguably the most troubled—Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, AIG and the GSEs—were not supervised by the Federal Reserve. Consequently, when those institutions came under stress, the Federal Reserve had poorer quality and far less timely information about the condition of these institutions than would have been the case if we had had the benefit of direct supervisory oversight.\n\nIn fact, some of the hardest choices the Federal Reserve had to make during the most chaotic weeks of the crisis concerned systemically important firms we did not regulate. It is not surprising that, in the wake of the crisis, some countries that had separated bank supervision from the central bank monetary policy role are now reconsidering that division of labor. That is mainly because coordination problems created difficulties in responding quickly and effectively in the crisis. Separation made it more difficult to communicate in a timely way and to understand the broader implications of what was transpiring. It is critical that we not introduce new inefficiencies and impediments. No matter what steps are taken to improve our regulatory system and strengthen market discipline, history tells us that there will inevitably be circumstances in which an informed and effective lender of last resort will play a critical role in preventing shocks and strains in financial markets and institutions from generating a broader collapse of the financial system.\n\nOf course, there are legitimate questions as to how broad the Federal Reserve's regulatory and supervisory responsibilities should be. That question is up to Congress, and should be decided on the merits. What is fundamentally at issue here is not “turf,” but rather how we as a nation can best ensure that we never again re-live the events of the past few years—that the legitimate public interests associated with a safe, efficient and impartial banking and financial system are well served.\n\nIn the end, it is critical that financial reform be decided on the basis of the merits. If objective and careful policymaking prevails, we will all be the better off for it. In contrast, if we fail in this endeavor, that would truly be tragic. We must act informed by the important lessons that we have learned from this crisis.\n\nThank you for your kind attention."

            "content": "Welcome to the New York Fed and to this timely conference on inflation-indexed securities and inflation risk management. Before discussing \"The Case for TIPS,\" I would like to thank conference organizers, participants, panelists and supporting Bank staff for planning and putting together today's event.\n\nIn particular, I wanted to thank John Campbell for his contribution to making today's conference a reality and I expect that his involvement will heighten attention to this subject and stimulate additional research from the academic community on the topics we discuss here.\n\nOver the past year, Treasury has been evaluating the costs and benefits of the TIPS program. Some research studies on this topic have concluded that the incremental financing costs associated with the TIPS program have been substantial; leading some to conclude that the costs may outweigh the benefits. Today’s program, which includes a panel discussion on the welfare benefits of inflation-protected securities, should help to broaden our knowledge on this topic.\n\nAs the title of my speech suggests, today I am going to lay out the reasons why I, along with my colleagues Jennifer Roush and Michelle Steinberg Ezer, believe that the benefits of the TIPS program exceed the costs of the program.\n\nBefore saying anything more, let me emphasize that the views I express today are my own and those of my co-authors and, therefore, may not represent the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee. Also, let me note that Jennifer and Michelle are the main authors of this paper. I have ridden along on their coattails. My main contribution was to slow down completion as I had to fit in my very modest contributions around the unfolding financial crisis! Finally, you may be wondering why this is my first speech since I have become president—an odd subject to choose, perhaps, given the ongoing financial crisis? The answer is a simple one, our paper and this conference have been in train for a long time. It is just a coincidence that the conference and my becoming president of the New York Fed have happened to arrive at about the same time.\n\nThe logic of issuing inflation-protected securities is straightforward. Wouldn’t some investors pay a premium—that is, accept a lower expected return—in exchange for guaranteed, full compensation for inflation? Because the United States and a number of other countries decided that the answer was likely to be “yes,” they developed an inflation-indexed government debt market.\n\nHas the program been a good development from the perspective of the U.S. Treasury? What about from the public’s perspective?\n\nA good starting point for answering these questions is to account for the costs and benefits of the program relative to an appropriate counterfactual. For example, we might start by comparing the difference in funding costs to the Treasury of TIPS versus a program of comparable duration nominal Treasuries.\n\nBut we should also be careful not to ignore other potential benefits of the TIPS program. As we see it, these potential benefits include:\n\nAlthough it is difficult to quantify these benefits, we argue that they are meaningful and should not be ignored in evaluating the benefits of the TIPS program.\n\nTurning first to the issue of measuring the impact of TIPS issuance on the government’s funding costs, this could be done simply by comparing the ex-post costs of a program of TIPS issuance to the costs of a comparable program of nominal Treasury issuance. Studies1 of this sort have typically shown that TIPS issuance has resulted in a higher net cost to the Treasury. Unfortunately, although this methodology is attractive in its simplicity, it has some flaws that undercut its usefulness in reaching conclusions about the attractiveness of the TIPS program.\n\nThe problem with an ex-post analysis is that it depends critically upon the performance of inflation over the period in question. If inflation turns out to have been meaningfully different than what was expected at the time of TIPS issuance, then this difference—the so-called “inflation surprise”—can be important in affecting the relative costs of TIPS versus nominal Treasury issuance. If inflation turns out to be higher than expected, then TIPS issuance will likely look to have been more expensive than nominal Treasury issuance. If inflation turns out lower, an ex-post analysis will likely show a savings from the TIPS program.\n\nOver the long run—and I mean the very long run—there should be roughly as many downward surprises in inflation performance as upward surprises. But within any relatively short period, such as the last decade, this certainly does not need to be the case. In other words, over such a short period, the outcome of an ex-post analysis can be heavily influenced by which of the two sides—the Treasury or investors—was the lucky recipient of the net inflation surprise that occurred over the period in question. For example, in countries such as the United Kingdom, where inflation declined following the inception of an inflation-linked debt program, ex-post studies generally suggest that these programs have reduced financing costs for these countries.\n\nThe fact that the Treasury saved or lost money ex-post is thus not a very reliable guide as to whether the strategic decision to implement a TIPS program has been a good idea. The relevant question is whether the Treasury obtained the financing it needed at a lower ex-ante cost. If the experiment were to be run thousands of times drawing from the underlying distribution of possible inflation outcomes, would Treasury’s costs have been lower, on average, with TIPS or with nominal Treasuries? To conclude on the basis of one coin flip or roll of the dice as ex-post analysis essentially does surely is not the best way to evaluate the respective costs of TIPS issuance versus nominal Treasuries.\n\nThus, we need to focus on the underlying factors that determine the ex-ante difference in costs.\n\nThere are two primary factors2 underlying the relative cost differences:\n\n1) the compensation investors require to hold a security that is less liquid than its nominal counterpart, termed the illiquidity premium, and 2) the insurance value they attach to obtaining protection against inflation risk, known as the inflation risk premium.\n\nWith regard to the first factor, when investors are worried about their ability to resell TIPS in a liquid secondary market, they require compensation for holding the securities compared with more liquid alternatives. This illiquidity premium tends to drive up TIPS yields and increase the Treasury’s borrowing costs.\n\nThe second factor works in the opposite direction. To the extent that investors are willing to pay for inflation protection, they would purchase TIPS at a price above that implied by their expected payment stream. As such, inflation risk premiums result in lower expected borrowing costs for the government and savings for the TIPS program compared with nominal issuance.\n\nTo determine which factor has been historically dominant, we conduct an ex-ante cost analysis: We compare the amount that the Treasury received for inflation compensation at auction with an observable measure of the inflation expectations of TIPS investors that is not contaminated by premiums for inflation risk or liquidity differentials. Unfortunately, we don’t have a perfect measure of expected inflation. Nevertheless, we may be able to get close. We do have estimates of expected inflation from other sources—such as the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. If such measures do indeed reflect the inflation expectations of investors, then we can conduct a reasonably accurate ex-ante analysis.\n\nTIPS analysts often talk about a concept they call the breakeven inflation rate. Essentially, this is the realized inflation rate that would cause investors to come out the same in terms of total compensation regardless of whether they had bought TIPS or nominal Treasuries.\n\nThe difference between the auction breakeven inflation rate and the SPF forecast yields a measure of the net savings or loss incurred by the Treasury that is independent of forecast errors. It is also equal to the net value of the illiquidity and inflation risk premiums associated with each TIPS. Our analysis, which covers TIPS auctions through April 2008, found that prior to 2004, the breakeven inflation rate was below the SPF. This indicates that the illiquidity premiums exceeded the inflation risk premium over this period. However, since 2004, we find that breakeven inflation rates were approximately equal to expected inflation, indicating that investors were roughly indifferent between the benefit of being protected against inflation risk versus the cost in terms of the greater illiquidity of TIPS relative to on-the-run nominal Treasuries. Thus, on an ex-ante basis, it appeared that the cost of issuing TIPS was about equal to the cost of issuing nominal Treasuries.\n\nTo determine the impact of the illiquidity premium and inflation risk premium on these results, we decomposed our ex-ante analysis, comparing the breakeven rate of inflation excluding the illiquidity premium in TIPS yields3 to the SPF forecast. This comparison yields an estimate of the premium investors were willing to pay for inflation protection at previous TIPS auctions. We found an average risk premium estimate of 47 basis points over our sample period. This suggests that the TIPS program does satisfy a real demand that is not met by nominal Treasuries.\n\nIt also suggests that if the Treasury were to take steps to shrink the illiquidity premium by, for example, improving secondary market trading in TIPS, this would shift the cost-benefit analysis more firmly in TIPS direction.\n\nA change in the TIPS illiquidity premium can have a notable impact on ex-ante cost analysis. For example, at the time this speech was written, the 10-year TIPS breakeven rate was approximately 1.10 percent, compared to the SPF forecast of 2.50 percent. This is in contrast to the end of our sample period, which showed them to be about equal. This means that today TIPS issuance is not very compelling. But it is important to emphasize that this shift has occurred at a time when the preference for liquidity is especially strong, benefitting nominal Treasuries versus TIPS. When the market turmoil subsides and this illiquidity premium shrinks, one might expect TIPS to again move ahead on an ex-ante basis.\n\nSo, at this point, the TIPS versus nominal issuance debate is inconclusive. But that’s before we have included some of the other considerable—although more difficult to quantify—benefits associated with TIPS issuance.\n\nLet me now discuss some of these other benefits.\n\nInflation Hedge for Households\nFirst, TIPS offer a benefit to investors because they have less risk than any other asset class. With virtually no credit risk or inflation risk, TIPS are one of the safest of investments.4 For investors that want such safety, TIPS offer significant benefits. Furthermore, the ability for investors to choose the amount of inflation risk they hold may result in a more optimal allocation of risk among investors with different tolerances.5 How much is this worth? Is the value of this completely captured in the relative interest costs of TIPS? Probably not, because the relative interest costs between TIPS and nominal Treasuries are set at the margin. We think there is some value in having a high-quality hedge to inflation risk, especially one that is available to less sophisticated investors.\n\nImproved Monetary Policy\nThe second noteworthy benefit from the TIPS program is that it helps improve the conduct of monetary policy. Foremost, the program provides up-to-date information about the evolution of inflation expectations and real interest rates. Because keeping inflation expectations well-anchored is so important in keeping inflation itself in check, real-time measures of inflation expectations may lead to better monetary policymaking. This, in turn, should improve macroeconomic performance. Although this is very difficult to quantify in terms of value, I think it is safe to say that in a $14 trillion economy, even a modest improvement in performance generates large dollar benefits.\n\nU.S. policymakers focus on a variety of inflation expectation measures, including private surveys of inflation expectations and market based measures, such as TIPS breakeven inflation rates. But in practice, the value of the survey-based measures is limited by the lack of timeliness—new data become available only monthly, quarterly or about every six weeks. Also, real money isn’t riding on the accuracy of the survey responses. In contrast, the comparison between nominal Treasury and TIPS yields represents the consensus of market participants.\n\nFor these reasons, policymakers rely importantly on the long-term inflation expectations proxied by the difference between nominal Treasury note and TIPS yields.\n\nSo, how much is this tool worth? Of course, it is very difficult to say. Perhaps, we would flatter ourselves and think that we could do just as well without such a market-based, real-time measure of inflation expectations. But I doubt it. After all, inflation expectations, when untethered, are very difficult to re-anchor. TIPS help make it easier to keep inflation expectations in check.\n\nImproved Fiscal Policy\nThe third less quantifiable benefit of TIPS is that the program may create incentives that can improve the conduct of fiscal policy. TIPS provide an explicit incentive for the fiscal authorities to conduct policy with an eye toward the consequences for inflation. The public’s recognition of this incentive may help hold down inflation expectations and cause inflation expectations to be more firmly anchored.\n\nIn addition, TIPS may give the Treasury access to a broader investor base, which also may reduce the Treasury’s overall borrowing costs. The comparison between the prevailing interest rates on TIPS versus nominal Treasuries provides insight into the relative costs associated with issuing a marginal dollar of debt. But just as important is whether TIPS issuance, by displacing nominal Treasury issuance, reduces the level of interest rates that the Treasury pays on its nominal issuances. This would occur if TIPS were not perfect substitutes for nominal Treasury securities and if the demand for nominal Treasuries were downward sloping— that is, not completely elastic.\n\nThe first condition almost certainly holds given the different attributes of TIPS versus nominal Treasuries. If they were perfect substitutes, then there would not be a liquidity premium for nominal Treasuries relative to TIPS. The second condition seems likely to hold since numerous studies have found that an increase in the net amount of Treasury borrowing leads to higher expected borrowing costs for the Treasury.\n\nHow big might this effect be? That’s difficult to estimate. A few studies6 have found that an increase in supply in a particular segment of the Treasury yield curve has contributed to a rise in yields. As a result, by issuing securities in a segmented TIPS market, the Treasury may keep realized yields on bill and nominal coupon securities lower than they otherwise would have been.\n\nThe last noteworthy fiscal benefit from TIPS issuance is the fact that it reduces risk to the U.S. government in terms of the variability of its net financial position. The rate of inflation influences both the cost of TIPS and the government’s tax receipts. Thus, some level of TIPS issuance may reduce the variability of the government’s net financial position. This, in turn, should lead to a more regular and predictable pattern of issuance, which should help minimize interest costs.\n\nIn summary, our analysis of the ex-ante costs of the TIPS program and the more difficult-to-measure benefits suggests that TIPS issuance provides at least a modest net benefit to the Treasury. So, now I want to turn to a related question: Are there ways to increase the benefits?\n\nI would be willing to make two modest suggestions here. First, it may make sense to emphasize longer-dated TIPS issuance rather than shorter-dated issuance. Analytically, the logic goes as follows. Inflation uncertainty is likely to increase at longer time horizons. Thus, investors are likely to pay a greater premium for inflation protection at longer-time horizons. This implies that the cost savings associated with TIPS are likely to be greater for longer maturities rather than shorter maturities.\n\nThis prediction is supported by empirical studies that have examined the premium that investors pay for inflation protection both in the United States and elsewhere. For example, a study by Brian Sack of Macroeconomic Advisors finds that forward breakeven inflation rates increase as maturity lengthens. In contrast, the level of survey-based measures of inflation expectations is quite constant beyond a time horizon of a few years. This means that the difference between forward breakeven inflation and inflation expectations climbs as the time horizon extends. This strongly suggests that the premium investors pay for inflation protection increases as maturities lengthen.\n\nSecond, it may make sense to structure the TIPS program in a way that would help reduce the illiquidity premium associated with TIPS relative to on-the-run nominal Treasuries. Some of the current illiquidity premium is likely to shrink as financial markets stabilize. However, further improvements may require a change in either the structure of the TIPS program or the secondary market trading environment.\n\nOn that note, I leave you with two outstanding questions:\n\n1.What are the best ways for the U.S. Treasury and the trading community to improve secondary market liquidity in TIPS?\n2. Given that TIPS appear attractive for the U.S. Treasury, what is the optimal allocation of the Treasury’s liability portfolio between TIPS and nominal securities?\n\nThank you for your attention.\n\n__________________________________________\n\n1 See Sack and Elsasser (2004), Roush (2008).\n2 In addition to these primary factors, TIPS yields also reflect the taxation difference between TIPS and nominal issues, the convexity difference between real and nominal yields and the price of the embedded deflation floor.\n3 We used the illiquidity premium in TIPS yields estimated in D’Amico, Kim and Wei (2008). D’Amico, Kim and Wei calculated the liquidity component for five- and ten-year TIPS yields, which we used to adjust the auction prices for 5- and 10-year TIPS issues. For twenty- and thirty-year TIPS issues, we assumed that the liquidity component is equal to the component for a ten-year security, which in the event that these securities are less liquid than the ten-year note, understates this effect and thus underestimates the risk premium at this horizon. For further information, see Dudley, Roush and Steinberg Ezer (2008).\n4 There is some inflation basis risk in that TIPS are based on the non-seasonally-adjusted consumer price index, and a household’s expenditure basket might differ from the basket in the CPI. Also, pension and endowment liabilities may be more closely related to other inflation or wage measures than the CPI.\n5 See Campbell and Shiller, 1996.\n6 See Fleming (2002), Krishnamurthy (2002), Laubach (2003)."

            "content": "I am going to talk today about some of the challenges facing the U.S. and financial system. These problems took a long time to build up, and, even with a forceful mix of public policy and action by the private sector, they will take time to resolve.\n\nThe central questions are: what caused the crisis and what explains its severity? What mix of policy measures will best contain the damage? And what changes to the financial system are likely to produce greater stability and resilience in the future?\n\nOrigins\nThe origins of this crisis lie in complex interaction of number of forces. Some were the product of market forces. Some were the product of market failures. Some were the result of incentives created by policy and regulation. Some of these were evident at the time, others are apparent only with the benefit of hindsight. Together they produced a substantial financial boom on a global scale.\n\nIn the five years leading up to the present stress, the world experienced an unusual mix of financial conditions.\n\nReal short-term interest rates were reduced around the world, following a nearly decade long secular decline in inflation rates, a slowdown in growth at the turn of this decade and subsequent deflation. As central banks raised their policy rates when the outlook improved and deflation risks had dissipated, both real and nominal long-term interest rates remained anomalously low.\n\nGlobal savings appeared to rise faster than did perceived real investment opportunities, and this development helped to push down real long-term interest rates around the world. At the same time, many emerging market economies built up very large levels of official reserves to reduce external vulnerability and to hold the value of their currencies stable against the dollar. The exchange rate policies in these economies—economies that together accounted for a increasing share of global GDP—made overall global financial conditions more accommodative, even as the United States and other countries tightened their monetary policies.\n\nExpected and realized volatility in both debt and equity markets were remarkably low for most of the last half a decade. Term premiums declined and remained low over much of this period. Credit spreads across a wide range of asset classes fell to levels that assumed unusually low levels of future losses. In the United States, credit, and mortgage credit in particular, expanded relative to GDP. Many households—including those previously lacking access to credit or with access only to expensive credit—found they could borrow on a significant scale to finance the purchase of a home and other expenses. Prices rose across a range of real and financial assets, most notably the prices of homes.\n\nThis constellation of broad economic and financial conditions was accompanied by rapid innovation in financial instruments that made credit risk easier to trade and, in principle at least, to hedge. These instruments allowed investors to buy insurance or protection against a broader range of individual credit risks, such as the default by a home owner or a company. Issuance of asset-backed securities (ABS), collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), as well as credit default swaps (CDS), expanded on a dramatic scale, particularly from 2005 through to mid-2007. And over this same period, the composition of the assets in ABS, as well as in CDOs and CLOs, shifted to higher credit risk mortgages and loans issued by noninvestment grade companies.\n\nEven though these instruments allow credit risk to be shared, their holders remain exposed to the less probable, but potentially very damaging effects of a significant increase in losses driven by macroeconomic factors. As underwriting standards deteriorated over this period, this exposure grew. And yet risk premia continued to fall, suggesting that investors did not fully appreciate the dynamic that was at work. As the boom persisted, investors grew more confident in the relative stability of macro and financial conditions and in the high levels of liquidity of the recent past, and projected that stability into the future. That confidence in a more stable future led to greater leverage and a larger exposure to the risk of a less benign world.\n\nThe interaction of these forces made the financial system as a whole more vulnerable to a range of different weaknesses. The models used by issuers to structure these products and by credit rating agencies to assess risk and assign ratings turned out to be much more sensitive to macroeconomic assumptions than was apparent to investors at the time. Assumptions about home price appreciation and the correlation of defaults within the underlying collateral pool were particularly critical in this context.\n\nThe proliferation of credit risk transfer instruments was driven in part by an assumption of frictionless, uninterrupted liquidity. This left credit and funding markets more vulnerable when liquidity receded. Banks and other financial institutions lent substantial amounts of money on the assumption that they would be able to distribute that risk easily into liquid markets. A sizable fraction of long-term assets—assets with exposure to different forms of credit risk—ended up in vehicles financed with very short-term liabilities and was placed with investors and funds that were also exposed to liquidity risk.\n\nAs is often the case during periods of rapid change, more significant concentrations of risk were present than was apparent at the time. Banks and investment banks sold insurance against what seemed like low probability events, but did so at what even at the time seemed like low prices. And on the assets they retained, these same institutions purchased insurance from financial guarantors and other firms that were exposed to the same risks.\n\nThe crisis exposed a range of weaknesses in risk management practices within financial institutions in the United States and throughout the world. Today, a group of the primary supervisors of the largest banks and investment banks in the world released a comprehensive assessment of risk management practices in these institutions. This assessment will help lay the foundation for consensus on changes to supervision going forward in the major financial centers. The report examines a range of practices that helped determine relative performance during this crisis. Banks and investment banks with stronger risk management practices and cultures did substantially better. The most common failures were in how firms dealt with uncertainty about the scale of losses they would face in a less benign economic and financial environment; the scale of the cushion they built up against that uncertainty; how well they managed the internal tension between risk and reward; and how quickly they moved to mitigate risk as conditions deteriorated.\n\nThe typical arsenal of risk management tools relies, by necessity, on history and experience, and as a result has only limited value in assessing the scale of potential future losses. These limitations were particularly damaging in a period in which significant innovation in financial instruments and market structure was coupled with relatively stable macroeconomic and financial conditions. Uncertainty about the future, and the greater complexity of leveraged structured products, created a dense fog around estimates of potential loss, making institutions and markets more vulnerable to an adverse surprise when conditions changed, and making it harder to manage the many principal agent problems inherent in the financial business.\n\nIn effect, some major banks and investments banks made the choice to follow the market down as underwriting practices eroded. They took on more exposure to low probability but extremely adverse events, despite the potential consequences of getting caught when the music stopped. And even though the largest firms were able to move quickly to protect themselves as conditions worsened, those actions had significant negative effects on market functioning and liquidity.\n\nThe current episode has a basic dynamic in common with all past crises. As market participants have moved to reduce exposure to further losses, to step on the brake, the brake became the accelerator, amplifying the shock. Measured risk has increased more quickly than many institutions have been able reduce it, and attempts to reduce it have added to volatility and downward pressure on prices, further increasing measured exposure to risk. Uncertainty about the market value of securities and about counterparty credit risk has increased, and many hedges have not performed as intended. The rational actions taken by even the strongest financial institutions to reduce exposure to future losses have caused significant collateral damage to market functioning. This, in turn, has intensified the liquidity problems for a wide range of bank and nonbank financial institutions.\n\nIn this environment, banks have faced several different types of liquidity and funding challenges. They have been called on to fund a range of different contingent liquidity and credit commitments, as is typically the case in crises. The substantial impairment of securitization and syndication markets has been an additional challenge because it has reduced banks’ access to liquidity and their capacity to move assets off balance sheets. As the market value of many securities has declined, and investors have reduced their willingness to finance more risky assets, liquidity conditions have eroded further. In response, even the strongest institutions have become much more cautious, building up large cushions of liquidity, bringing down leverage and reducing financing for their leveraged counterparties.\n\nPolicy Measures\nThe self-reinforcing dynamic within financial markets has intensified the downside risks to growth for an economy that is already confronting a very substantial adjustment in housing and the possibility of a significant rise in household savings.\n\nThe intensity of the crisis is in part a function of the size of the preceding financial boom, but also of the speed of the deterioration in confidence about the prospects for growth and in some of the basic features of our financial markets. The damage to confidence—confidence in ratings, in valuation tools, in the capacity of investors to evaluate risk—will prolong the process of adjustment in markets. This process carries with it risks to the broader economy. Macroeconomic and supervisory policies have an important role to play in containing those risks.\n\nLet me mention several critical areas of policy.\n\nMonetary policy. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has reduced the nominal federal funds rate target substantially in a relatively short period of time, with much of this reduction occurring ahead of the deterioration in confidence and the broader slowdown in spending that is now apparent. But even with those reductions in short-term interest rates in place, financial conditions have tightened as risk spreads on a wide range of asset classes and institutions have increased considerably. The critical risk to the economic outlook remains the potential for the strains in financial markets to have an outsized adverse effect on real economic activity, particularly by exacerbating the already significant weakness in the housing sector. It is important for monetary policy and liquidity instruments to be used proactively in addressing this risk.\n\nBut this is not the only challenge we face. Headline and core inflation have come in higher than anticipated, and inflation expectations have also moved up. If the risk of significant damage to growth from these financial market pressures is attenuated and if global growth remains strong and drives a continuing rise in energy and commodity prices, then inflation may not moderate as much as we anticipate. If the medium term outlook for inflation deteriorates significantly, the FOMC will move with appropriate speed and force to address this risk.\n\nThis requires a fine balance. The principal challenge for policy is to provide an adequate degree of insurance against the downside risks that still confront the economy as a whole, without adding to concerns about inflation over the medium term. We cannot know with confidence today what level of the short-term real funds rate will be consistent with our objectives of sustainable growth and low inflation, but if turbulent financial conditions and the associated downside risks to growth persist, monetary policy may have to remain accommodative for some time.\n\nLiquidity provision. Although concerns about credit quality are at the root of the current problems in financial markets, a substantial impairment in market liquidity conditions can exacerbate and prolong the adjustment in credit conditions. To mitigate this risk, we have taken a series of actions to help reduce the risk that market liquidity conditions exacerbate the adjustment process in credit markets.\n\nBy allowing institutions to finance with the central bank assets they could no longer finance as easily in the market, we have reduced the need for them to take other actions, such as selling other assets into distressed markets, or withdrawing credit lines extended to other financial institutions, that would have amplified pressures in markets. These measures—the Term Auction Facility and swap arrangements—have had some success in mitigating market pressures, in part by providing a form of insurance against future stress. We now have in place a cooperative framework for liquidity provision among the major central banks. And we have considerable flexibility to adjust the dimensions of these liquidity tools. We will keep them in place as long as necessary, and continue to adapt them where we see a compelling case to do so.\n\nEncouraging financial repair. The Federal Reserve is working closely with other financial supervisors and regulators to facilitate the adjustment underway in markets. This approach has two important elements. The first is to encourage improvements in the quality of valuation methods and disclosure by the major regulated financial institutions and the necessary adjustment in valuations and reserves to reflect the deterioration in expected losses. Better disclosure can reduce some uncertainty about the incidence and magnitude of potential losses across the financial system, although it is important to note that these estimates of losses are a function of the outlook for the economy and will necessarily change as expectations of the future change.\n\nThe second element is to encourage new equity capital raising, so that the burden for preserving capital ratios does not fall principally on actions, such as asset sales or reduced lending, that might exacerbate the credit crunch. We have seen a very substantial flow of new capital into the financial system much more quickly than has been the case in past crises. More will come. Those institutions that move more quickly will obviously be in a stronger position to deal with the challenges, and take advantage of the opportunities, ahead.\n\nFiscal stimulus. Monetary policy can, of course, play a powerful role in reducing the downside risks to growth, but overall policy will be more effective, particularly given the strains to the financial sector, if the full burden does not fall on the tools available to the Federal Reserve. Fiscal policy can play an important role. The stimulus program signed into law by the President will provide a meaningful level of support to growth, somewhere in the range of three quarters to one and half of a percentage point of GDP growth over the next few quarters.\n\nTargeted support for housing. Policy can also play an important role in helping cushion the effects of the fall in housing prices and the rise in foreclosures in the United States. The decline in house prices and the surge in foreclosures now underway will have significant spillovers to other homes in the same neighborhoods, effects that are not fully incorporated into decisions by private creditors and investors to workout mortgages on mutually beneficial terms. The degree to which mortgages are now held in securitized and complex leverage structures exacerbates the incentive and coordination problems inherent in this situation. Carefully designed, targeted programs in cooperation with the private sector can play an important role in resolving the various constraints that are now impeding economically viable mortgage restructurings. Given the breakdowns in the securitization process and its potential impact on the supply of new mortgage credit, it also makes sense to explore ways to expand the scope for existing government programs to support financing of new homes.\n\nThis policy framework—macroeconomic stimulus, liquidity support, new equity for the financial system, and targeted support for housing—will help reduce the risks to the outlook and bring about an earlier return to growth rates more in line with the economy’s long term potential.\n\nLonger Term Reforms of the Financial System\nThe unwinding of this global financial boom has caused a substantial degree of stress to the financial system.\n\nWas this preventable? I don’t believe that asset price and credit booms are preventable. They cannot be effectively diffused preemptively. There is no reliable early warning system for financial shocks. And yet policy plays an important role in determining the dimensions of financial booms, and policy helps determine the ability of the financial system and the economy to adjust to its aftermath. We need to undertake a broad set of changes to address the vulnerabilities in our financial system revealed by this crisis. Just as a long list of factors contributed to the trauma, there is no single reform that offers the promise of sufficient change.\n\nThe Presidents Working Group on Financial Markets and the Financial Stability Forum, which bring together policymakers and regulators from the major financial centers around the world, are in the process of outlining a comprehensive framework of reforms. Many of these recommendations will focus on changes to the mortgage finance market, the ratings process for ABS and structured credit products more broadly, regulatory and accounting treatment of these instruments and special purpose financing vehicles, the disclosure requirements on instruments and institutions, and other dimensions of the securitization process.\n\nI want to conclude with a few comments on some of the broader policy questions we face in designing these reforms.\n\nRegulatory reform and simplification. The regulations that affect incentives in the U.S. financial system have evolved into a very complex and uneven framework, with substantial opportunities for arbitrage, large gaps in coverage, significant inefficiencies, and large differences in the degree of oversight and restraint upon institutions that engage in very similar economic activities. Some illustrations of this include the large shift in subprime mortgage originations to less regulated institutions; the incentives to shift risk to where accounting and capital treatment is more favorable; and the amount of risk built up in entities that operate in the grey areas of implied support from much larger affiliated institutions.\n\nWe need to move to a simpler framework, with a more uniform set of rules applied evenly across entities involved in similar functions, and a more effective balance of regulation and market discipline. And institutions that are banks, or are built around banks, with special access to the safety net, need to be subject to a stronger form of consolidated supervision than our current framework provides.\n\nCapital. The U.S. banking system entered this financial shock with capital cushions significantly above the regulatory thresholds, and in a stronger position to withstand a downturn than was the case in the past. This has made it possible for bank balance sheets to expand rapidly, which in turn has helped offset the effects of the withdrawal of many nonbank financial institutions from credit markets.\n\nYet the shock absorbers in the financial system as a whole—the financial cushions that are critical to financial stability—have proved to be thinner, and behavior has been more pro-cyclical than desirable.\n\nThis is in part the consequence of changes in the structure of the financial system. Because banks are now a smaller share of the system, a given level of stress on nonbanks creates greater strain on the system as a whole. It is in part the consequence of the fact that the present system focuses on mitigating the risks of firm specific shocks, rather than a systematic market shock. And it is in part the consequence of the fact that the present system is not designed to induce institutions, particularly the largest ones, to internalize the negative consequences, the negative externalities, of their actions on markets as a whole in conditions of stress.\n\nThere is no simple solution to this problem. It requires a broad look at the design of the present capital regime, the incentives it creates for holding different forms of risk, and the scope of the application of these requirements. As we move to a more modern and risk-sensitive capital framework and reduce the perverse incentives in the current capital requirements, we need to make sure that reserves, capital, and liquidity provisions are more forward looking, and adjust appropriately through the peaks and valleys of the cycle. This will increase the scope for banks and other institutions that are subject to risk-based capital requirements to act more as a stabilizing force in response to future financial market shocks.\n\nMarket infrastructure. We are in the midst of a dramatic period of financial innovation and growth in derivative instruments, but the pace of change the growth in volume has brought a lot of challenges. Substantial progress has been made to strengthen this infrastructure over the past two and a half years, and the resilience of the broader financial infrastructure has been a source of strength for the financial system during this crisis. However, the systems and practices that support the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market significantly lags that of securities markets and other mature markets. We need to move quickly to put in place a more integrated operational infrastructure that supports all major OTC derivatives products, is highly automated, has robust operational resilience and risk management, and is capable of handling very substantial growth in volumes.\n\nConclusion\nThe U.S. economic and financial system is undergoing a very challenging period of adjustment, and we are likely to be living with a high degree of uncertainty for some period of time about the ultimate magnitude and duration of the slowdown underway. But it is important to recognize that we have already seen a lot of adjustment. Prices and risk premia in many markets already reflect a much more sober and cautious view of the world than they did a year ago. And the degree of stress on markets that we have seen over the past six months is due in part to the sheer magnitude and speed of that adjustment to a more cautious view of the future.\n\nThe United States, the world economy, and the financial system as a whole, are more resilient, than they were on the eve of previous downturns. The improvements in productivity growth in the United States of the past decade have been followed by significant improvements in potential growth and wealth accumulation in many other countries. The scale of investable assets around the globe is very substantial, and this will be an important source of demand for risk assets. The improvements in monetary policy credibility and in financial strength developed over the past few decades mean that policy around the world has more room to adjust to deal with the challenge in the present environment.\n\nNevertheless, the challenges that remain are substantial. The speed and agility with which public policy makers and private financial institutions respond to the continuing pressures in a rapidly evolving environment will determine how quickly and how smoothly market conditions return to normal—and how rapidly the risks to the economic outlook are mitigated."

            "content": "It is a pleasure to be here at the Council on Foreign Relations, and to be here with Jerry Corrigan.\n\nA few brief remarks about the global economy, both the real and financial dimensions, to provide a basis for our discussion.\n\n2006 marked the fourth successive year of a global expansion that has been remarkable for its strength, for its breadth, and for its stability in the face of economic shocks and uncertainty in the geopolitical realm.\n\nThis period of broad-based growth in income has been supported by a number of important fundamental forces.\n\nRapid technological innovation and greater economic integration have brought stronger growth and higher levels of productivity. The acceleration in productivity growth that occurred in the United States in the second half of the last decade seems likely to remain intact. And productivity growth is accelerating outside the United States, most strikingly in some of the large emerging economies.\n\nFinancial innovation and greater integration of national financial systems has contributed to the strength of real economic activity by improving the allocation of resources within and among economies. Improvements to risk management and to capital cushions are likely to have made the financial system more stable and more resilient.\n\nAnd macroeconomic policy has improved around the world. The increase in monetary policy credibility in a broad range of countries has produced lower rates of inflation and more stability in inflation expectations. Greater public confidence in monetary policy was critical to laying the foundation for the improvements in real economic performance, by providing a stable foundation for long-term investment decisions.\n\nIn emerging markets, better monetary policy has been accompanied by more disciplined and conservative fiscal policy and a range of other policies that have reduced, though not eliminated, vulnerability to changes in confidence, capital flows and exchange rate movements.\n\nThese factors are each fundamentally important, and they are, of course, interrelated. The policies that delivered better inflation outcomes, more openness and competition and stronger financial systems were critical to fostering an environment in which improvements in productivity and growth could occur.\n\nThis expansion has also been notable for the financial conditions that have prevailed over the past several years.\n\nLong-term interest rates have remained relatively low in nominal and real terms. Equity and other asset prices have moved higher. Credit spreads have declined to quite low levels. Market participants report exceptionally high levels of liquidity. And volatility, both realized and expected, has remained low across many different types of financial assets, market and economies.\n\nThis general constellation of market conditions and asset prices is unusual, at least in comparison to what we have seen over the past several decades. This has been a distinguishing feature of the present expansion, but it is not something we fully understand, and we cannot be confident in judgments about how durable it will prove to be.\n\nTo a significant extent, these financial developments reflect a high degree of confidence in future macroeconomic and financial stability, reinforced by the improvements in inflation performance, growth outcomes and financial resilience of the past several years.\n\nBetter monetary policy has lowered expectations of future inflation and inflation volatility and has contributed to lower risk premiums in general. Changes in the cyclical behavior of financial intermediation and credit provision, coupled with the increased stability of the real economy, seem likely to have reinforced the improvements on the monetary policy front.\n\nAnd rapid growth in the major emerging market economies, together with the substantial earnings of energy-producing and commodity-exporting countries, have produced a substantial increase in wealth and savings relative to perceived investment opportunities. In a world where capital can now flow much more freely across national borders, a significant portion of these savings has moved across national borders.\n\nThese are powerful and fundamental forces, and they certainly help explain the broad reduction in risk premiums and the substantial demand for credit risk and financial assets.\n\nThere are other factors at work as well, however, that have less favorable implications. Part of this recent dynamic in financial markets is a consequence of the present state of the international monetary system, in which a substantial part of the world economy runs exchange rate regimes tied in some way to the dollar. This has entailed a sustained period of very substantial official accumulation of dollar reserves, putting downward pressure on U.S. interest rates and upward pressure on U.S. asset prices.\n\nThese forces are surely transitory, but their impact on capital flows, interest rates and asset prices are important, not just in terms of their short-term impact on growth. If they are large enough, they have the potential to alter or distort current decisions about investment and consumption in a way that could be detrimental to our longer-run growth prospects. And they are important because they work to mask or dampen the effects on risk premiums in financial markets that we might otherwise expect to be associated with the expected trajectory of the fiscal and external imbalances in the United States.\n\nGiven this broad context, I want to touch briefly on some of the policy issues that are likely to be important to the prospects for economic performance, here and around the world. Despite the relatively favorable performance of the global economy, we face a range of daunting longer-term economic policy challenges. The improvements in the conduct of monetary policy were critical to the improvements in productivity and growth that we are now seeing on a global scale. And monetary policy will, of course, continue to be critical, but monetary policy alone cannot provide the elements of the framework necessary to provide an environment for innovation and long-term decisions that will be so vital for future growth. Economic policy, in general, needs to be more forward looking in providing a longer-term framework for stability.\n\nOn the fiscal policy front, demographic changes confront governments around the world with exceptionally difficult choices. For the United States, these challenges are less acute than for many of the major economies, but they are still formidable in their scale and complexity. Even for the near term—for the period before the increase in number of retirees starts to have a major impact on Social Security and Medicare expenditures—we are running an unsustainably large fiscal deficit. Despite the recent improvements in revenues, the expected trajectory for the fiscal deficit will mean that federal government debt will continue to rise as a share of GDP. The restoration of fiscal rules—such as those that require new tax cuts or expenditure programs to be funded with offsetting policy measures—will help reduce the risk of further deterioration. However, they need to be complemented by a consensus on policy changes that will produce smaller future deficits.\n\nRestoring confidence in U.S. fiscal management would be important and necessary independent of the broader context of the global economy today, but it is more important given the size of our external imbalance, now running at the unprecedented level of 7 percent of GDP a year. The trade balance in real terms has been broadly stable over the past two years, but our net income payments have shifted to deficit, and the size of that component of the current account deficit seems likely to continue to expand. These large global imbalances, our current account deficit and the surpluses that are the counterpart to our deficit, will have to come down over time. How that process unfolds will depend on a complex mix of factors around the world. Confidence that the U.S. political system will act to generate a sustainable fiscal trajectory is important to raising the probability that this process of adjustment unfolds with less risk.\n\nA successful conclusion of the Doha round of trade negotiations would provide some insurance against the risk that the process of economic integration will be interrupted or reversed. Despite the relatively favorable average income gains of the past few years, a common feature of the political context in economies around the world is the fragility or weakness of public support for openness and economic integration.\n\nThe political challenge of sustaining support for the process of integration may be the most important economic challenge of our time. To paraphrase Lawrence Summers, it is not enough to explain that globalization is inevitable and that policies that look politically attractive as a response to economic anxiety will only hurt the economy as a whole. Nor is it a politically effective strategy to state simply that economic integration is a necessary and powerful force in raising average incomes, or that technological change may be more important than trade or immigration as an explanation for slower growth in real wages for many Americans.\n\nRaising the quality of education and exploring ways to improve the safety net are a necessary part of the solution to this challenge. But these reforms will have a long fuse and they may not yield the hoped-for increase in support. Trade does not appear to be more popular in countries with more generous safety nets, universal health care and highly subsidized higher education than it is today in the United States.\n\nThe political challenges of sustaining support for global economic integration and fiscal sustainability will be more difficult in the United States because of what has happened to the distribution of income and economic insecurity. Several broad economic forces substantially complicate an already difficult set of political challenges: the long-term increase in income inequality, the slow pace of growth in real wages for the middle quintiles of the population, the increase in the volatility of income that is a reflection of the greater flexibility of the U.S. economy, and the greater exposure of households to the risk in financing retirement and the burden of paying for health care.\n\nMore generally, the global financial system and the monetary arrangements that underpin it are in the process of a delicate and consequential transition as the major emerging market economies—particularly in Asia—move toward more mature monetary policy frameworks, more flexible exchange rate regimes and more open capital markets. This transition will require careful management, and the economic dimensions of getting it right would be complicated even without the political pressures those governments face.\n\nOne final note on the financial system. The global financial system is in the process of very dramatic change. The changes of even just the last five years are extraordinary, in terms of the size, and strength, and scope of the major global firms, the role of private leveraged funds, the extent of risk transfer and the increase in the size of the derivatives market, the change in the structure of the credit market, the increase in and changes in the pattern of cross border financial flows.\n\nThese changes, and others, seem likely to have made the financial system both more effective in moving capital to its most productive use and more stable and resilient over time. But they do not, of course, mean the end of systemic risk in financial markets. They could in some circumstances work to magnify rather than mitigate stress. Central banks, supervisors and those running the major private financial institutions need to continue to work to ensure that what Jerry Corrigan calls the “shock absorbers” in the financial system—capital and liquidity and the operational infrastructure—are sufficiently strong and robust to withstand economic and financial conditions more adverse than we have seen in the recent past.\n\nThank you."

            "content": "Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak to you today. The craft and the discipline of the business economist have long had a special place in the Federal Reserve System. And I am pleased to have the chance to meet with this distinguished group in the profession.\n\nMy remarks are my personal views and do not attempt to represent the views of the FOMC.\n\nThe U.S. economy has entered its 17th quarter of economic expansion. As has been the case throughout history, this expansion has features that distinguish it from past expansions, and I’ll begin my talk today with a review of some of these features.\n\nGrowth in real GDP has been remarkably stable over the past two years, even when compared with the moderation in growth that has occurred over the previous two decades relative to the earlier part of the post-war period. These steady growth rates have hovered in the vicinity of 3.5 percent, which is close to most estimates of the rate of potential growth in the U.S. The robustness of growth is a testament to the resiliency and flexibility of the U.S. economy in responding to adverse shocks.\n\nA key feature of this expansion is the continued strength in productivity growth. The 3.7 percent annual rate of productivity growth the U.S. economy has averaged since the end of 2002 is well above most estimates of the underlying or structural rate of growth in productivity, which tend to be between 2.5 and 2.75 percent, estimates themselves that are much higher than those of a decade earlier and reflect the outstanding productivity performance of the U.S. economy in the last 10 years. Much of the source of the recent productivity growth seems to be in multi factor or total factor productivity—in other words, in increases in the efficiency of business processes and the use of technology.\n\nThese developments in productivity growth are important, of course, because of their potentially favorable implications for inflation dynamics and for future income growth.\n\nOverall inflation has risen over the past two years, pushed up primarily by higher prices for energy and other commodities and industrial inputs. Inflation excluding food and energy, however, has been quite moderate, in part due to very modest growth in unit labor costs. Survey based measures of consumer inflation expectations at longer horizons have remained stable despite the large increases in energy prices, though some of them remain slightly above the 1.5 to 2.5 range for the CPI index that some have cited as a reasonable definition of price stability in the United States.\n\nThese favorable developments in fundamentals have been accompanied by important developments in financial markets.\n\nExpectations of future inflation have fallen, and there appears to be confidence in continued stable, low inflation. Credit spreads and measures of future volatility derived from financial market data have fallen, suggesting that investors and savers expect the greater realized stability in growth is likely to endure. Real interest rates at longer horizons have remained relatively low, reflecting at least in part that the global supply of savings has increased relative to demand for investment. A range of different asset prices has risen significantly, and the expected volatility of many asset prices has fallen.\n\nThese developments in market prices have occurred in the context of important changes in financial intermediation, including the substantial expansion of access to consumer credit and capacity for homeowners to borrow against the equity in their homes, the greater use of financial instruments for transferring and mitigating risk, and the growth of financial flows between countries. And in this context, balance sheets have continued their impressive growth, with assets and liabilities of both households and of economies as a whole growing faster than income.\n\nThese broad trends are obviously related. Less overall concern about inflation and real risk, the positive outlook for productivity growth, and the increasing depth and sophistication of financial markets, all might be expected to induce an increase in the scale of gross liabilities and assets relative to income, for leverage and net borrowing to increase relative to income.\n\nWhile policymakers can witness the movements in key financial market variables, it is difficult to say for sure what their implications are for economic fundamentals, that is, for inflation and output. And even if we had more confidence in the forces behind past movements in asset values, we would still face substantial uncertainty about their future behavior. The relatively low compensation for risk priced into asset markets today does not necessarily mean the future will justify that confidence.\n\nThis uncertainty surrounding the current behavior of asset values complicates the task of assessing the future trajectory of asset prices, and the impact of alternative monetary policy paths on asset values. And by widening the already substantial degree of uncertainty that surrounds estimates of the equilibrium real rate of interest, these developments complicate the task of assessing the appropriateness of a given stance of monetary policy against the objectives of the Federal Reserve.\n\nWhile the evolution toward more efficient and globally integrated financial markets is surely a positive for long-run economic growth both here and abroad, it also challenges policymakers to constantly update and question our understanding of the behavior of financial market indicators and the signals that these indicators can provide in the policymaking process. And as financial markets continue to broaden and deepen, the behavior of asset prices will play an important role in the formulation of monetary policy going forward, perhaps a more important role than in the past.\n\nWhat might this mean for the Fed and for other central banks in practice?\n\nThere is a well established, and I believe fundamentally correct, case against directing monetary policy at specific objectives for asset values or the future path of those values. In other words, asset values should be neither a target nor a goal of monetary policy. The rate of increase in asset values alone seems to tell us very little about underlying and future inflation. Because we know so little about how to assess the appropriateness of asset values against fundamentals, because we have so little capacity to both forecast and predictably affect the future path of asset prices, and because we know relatively little about how changes in wealth affect the real economy and inflation, we cannot use monetary policy responsibly or effectively to achieve specific objectives for asset values. Monetary policy does not today and is unlikely in the future to offer us an effective tool for directly reducing the incidence of large or sustained deviations of asset values from what might turn out to be their fundamental values, what some call bubbles.\n\nThat said, monetary policy still has to take into account the impact of significant movements in asset values on output and inflation. Financial asset prices, by their nature, allocate resources between the present and the future and thereby affect consumption, investment and future growth. History provides us with numerous examples in which significant movements in asset prices have had sizable effects on the path of output relative to potential and on price stability.\n\nAnd experience suggests that asset values can be very sensitive to movements in monetary policy or to the perceptions of future policy moves. The challenge for central banks is to determine how movements in asset values and expected asset values affect the evolution of the economy. There is little to suggest that the task has gotten easier with the increasing complexity of financial markets, and it has more likely gotten harder.\n\nThe incorporation of asset price movements into monetary policy formation is hard to do, in part, because we don’t know that much about the transmission mechanism from movements in asset values to the underlying economic fundamentals we care about. We cannot estimate with a high degree of confidence the effects of realized asset price movements on economic outcomes. The relationship, for example, between changes in housing prices or equity prices and household savings and consumption varies substantially across time and circumstances, a fact that only exacerbates the difficulty of sorting out the effect of changes in wealth from other factors, such as greater confidence in future real growth resulting from the acceleration in productivity growth.\n\nAnd successfully integrating asset prices into monetary policy formulation is also hard to do because of the difficulty of assessing how potential alternative paths for monetary policy will feed through to overall financial conditions and thereby for output and inflation—in other words it is difficult to forecast how changes in current or expected policy will affect asset values.\n\nThese and other factors magnify the challenge of taking asset prices into account in the formulation of monetary policy. But to acknowledge these complexities does not weaken the case for the importance of trying to make sensible judgments about how monetary policy should respond to asset price developments. Here are some considerations for how central banks should navigate through these challenges.\n\nFirst, in circumstances where the central bank observes a large realized movement in asset prices and is confident in its knowledge of the impact of those moves on the path of aggregate demand, monetary policy may need to follow a different path than might have seemed appropriate in the absence of those developments. In other words, when policymakers have already witnessed a significant move in asset values, and are confident in what that move means for the outlook, it should be prepared to adjust policy accordingly. Note that in order for this seemingly straightforward proposition to apply the central bank must be responding to its assessment of what an already observed movement in asset prices will mean for output and inflation.\n\nOf course central banks must always be prepared to respond when factors threaten to push aggregate demand away from aggregate supply and impact the inflation outlook. Movements in asset prices certainly have the potential to be one of those factors, and the implications of this approach apply in both directions. In other words, central banks have to be prepared to adjust policy when past asset price increases could be a significant factor putting upward pressure on aggregate demand, as well as when past declines threaten to reduce output relative to potential.\n\nAlthough the potential case for adjusting policy applies in both directions, the implications for policy may differ. Because some asset prices may fall more abruptly than they rise, and because the effects of downward moves in asset prices on demand may be larger due to the greater negative impact of deflation on the net worth of borrowers—witness the United States in the 1930s or Japan in the 1990s, the case for adjusting monetary policy in response to negative asset price shocks is commonly considered more compelling than in the alternative context. But this does not mean that monetary policy should generally ignore the effects of increases and only respond to observed declines in asset prices. The test should be the size and circumstances of the asset price moves and their impact on the forecast relative to the central banks’ objectives, not the direction of the asset price move.\n\nDifferent considerations apply in the circumstances where the central bank is considering how a potential future move in asset prices may affect the forecast. These circumstances call for even greater caution and care. Here is it very important that the forecasts central banks consider in making monetary policy decisions are explicit about assumptions for future asset price movements, the uncertainty that surrounds them, the sensitivity of the forecast to alternative assumptions, and the costs and consequences of alternative paths for monetary policy. Even in circumstances where asset prices may appear to have moved away from fundamentals, and it seems reasonable to consider the implications of some deceleration in the pace of future increase or some decline, central banks need to be very cautious about adjusting policy in anticipation of that event, much less directing policy at inducing it. The substantial uncertainty about the path of asset price movements going forward necessarily reduces the case for altering policy in advance of the move.\n\nConsider the case in which it seems prudent for the central bank to incorporate an assumption for a significant move in the rate of change in future asset prices into its forecasts for output and inflation. If the central bank’s assumption is that asset prices are likely to fall over the forecast horizon, perhaps in the wake of a sustained rise in those prices, then it might in turn forecast a softer path for aggregate demand. These changes in the outlook might imply a lower expected path for the target rate than would have been implied by a different assumed path for the behavior of asset prices. If it turns out that the anticipated fall in asset prices does not materialize, the policy constructed under the assumption of a decline will likely have been too easy, and that might itself contribute to further rises in asset prices.\n\nThis might sound like a more or less generic statement about the perils of having to make policy based on forecasts, but there is a sense in which the forecasting of asset prices, or indeed even understanding the driving forces behind movements in asset price after they have occurred, is particularly challenging. This is why there is a vast literature focusing on these challenges and characterizing the many \"puzzles\" of the behavior of asset prices.\n\nMore generally, despite the fact that policymakers can’t be completely confident in their assessment of the future path of asset prices, it seems unavoidable that these assessments will factor into policy decisions. This is not to say that central banks should lean against bubbles or against asset price movements themselves. Nor should the appropriate response to a given change in asset prices be to change policy by more than what would be appropriate to address the effects on the central objectives of the central bank. But policy, in some circumstances, will need to respond to asset price movements when those movements alter the central bank’s assessment of the risks to its outlook, and that change in the assessment of the risks to the forecast should be part of the central bank’s communication with the public.\n\n\nThis leaves us with no simple or clear doctrine for the role of asset prices in monetary policy regimes. Asset prices probably matter more than they once did, but what that means for monetary policy necessarily depends on the circumstances.\n\nPerhaps it makes sense to conclude with the more general observation that changes in the size of balance sheets increase the importance of sustaining the credibility of monetary policy, because they increase the costs of a loss of credibility or a negative shock to credibility. We live with considerable uncertainty about the sustainability of the pattern of relatively low risk premia and reduction in the cost of insurance against future macroeconomic and financial volatility. That uncertainty necessarily adds to the normally substantial degree of uncertainty we face in making monetary policy judgments. All these factors strengthen the case for being open about what we do not know. And it reinforces the case for preserving confidence in our commitment to keep underlying inflation low over time, and for retaining the capacity to respond with flexibility to the challenges we face in this uncertain world.\n\nThank you."
