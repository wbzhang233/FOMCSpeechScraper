    "content": "It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak here today.  In my remarks, I will focus on the 2015 economic outlook and the implications for monetary policy.  In general, I will paint a reasonably positive picture\u2014an economy that is likely to make further progress towards the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s (FOMC) objectives of maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability.  In fact, if my own forecast is realized, I would expect to favor raising the FOMC\u2019s federal funds rate target sometime in 2015.  This would be a welcome development, because it would signify that the economy has healed sufficiently to warrant a somewhat less accommodative monetary policy.  As always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the FOMC or the Federal Reserve System. \n\nThe Growth Outlook Is Improving\n\nSince the official end of the Great Recession more than five years ago, the U.S. economy has grown at a disappointing 2.3 percent annualized rate.  Several times over that period, it appeared that growth was breaking out on the upside, but each time such hopes were disappointed.  We are again at a similar junction.  Over the past few quarters, the pace of economic growth has picked up and the broad consensus is that the U.S. economy will grow at about a 2 \u00bd-3 percent annual rate over the next year.1\n\nWill these forecasts once again turn out to be too optimistic?  Subject to a few caveats that I discuss later, my view is that the likelihood of another disappointment has lessened.  The consensus forecast seems like a reasonable expectation, in part, because several of the \u201cheadwinds\u201d restraining U.S. economic activity in recent years have subsided.  First, the housing sector is currently in much better balance.  The overhang of housing associated with the housing boom has largely been absorbed, and a recovery in housing prices has significantly shrunk the proportion of borrowers that are underwater on their mortgages\u2014that is, those households that have outstanding mortgage balances higher than the value of their homes.  Also, measures of distress such as mortgage delinquencies and homes entering the foreclosure process have fallen.  \n\nSecond, consumers are in better financial shape.  Households are carrying less debt, with total household liabilities roughly $500 billion below their cyclical peak in 2008.  Moreover, lower interest rates have facilitated significant mortgage debt refinancing, which has lowered the household debt service burdens.  Depending on the particular measure used, household debt service burdens relative to income have fallen back to levels last seen in the 1980s and 1990s.  In addition, household net worth has recovered sharply, boosted primarily by higher financial asset valuations, but also by some recovery in home prices. \n\nThird, the fiscal restraint that has held back growth in recent years has ended, with the federal budget deficit now at a level consistent with a stable to slowly declining federal debt-to-GDP ratio.  In the aggregate, state and local governments have also ended their retrenchment.  One important piece of evidence in this regard is the fact that state and local government employment is now rising at between 5,000 and 10,000 per month, after generally contracting during the 2009 to 2012 period.  \n\nNow that these headwinds have subsided, buoyant financial market conditions spurred, in part, by a very accommodative monetary policy should do more to support economic activity.  In particular, compared to historical patterns, the current household net worth-to-income ratio is high relative to the personal saving rate.  This suggests some scope for a decline in the household saving rate.  If this were to occur, consumption growth would outstrip income growth.  Similarly, financial market conditions are conducive to sustained gains in business fixed investment.  Equity prices are high, borrowing costs are low, cash flows are strong and corporate balance sheets are healthy.  \n\nAnother positive development for both the U.S. and the global economy is the sharp decline in energy prices.  Let\u2019s start with the U.S. perspective.  Despite the impressive recent gains in natural gas and crude oil production, the U.S. still is a net importer of energy.  As a result, falling energy prices are beneficial for our economy.  In economist parlance, falling energy prices are a positive \u201cterms of trade\u201d shock for the U.S.  Over the near-term, this will lead to a significant rise in real income growth for households and should be a strong spur to consumer spending.  Since energy expenditures represent a higher proportion of outlays for lower income households, falling energy prices disproportionately raise their real incomes.  Also, because such households are more liquidity constrained, with budgets that often bind paycheck to paycheck, they have a higher tendency to spend any additional real income.  As a result, much of the boost to real household income from falling energy prices is likely to be spent, not saved.  \n\nMore broadly, the decline in energy prices also will be supportive to the global growth outlook in two other ways.  First, by pulling down inflation in many countries it will spur more expansive monetary policy.  We are already seeing this response in Europe and Japan.  Second, the decline in energy prices is also likely to ease the global fiscal stance.  Over the near-term, for oil exporting governments, falling revenue will not be fully offset by reduced expenditures.  This will cause major oil exporters to run either smaller budget surpluses or bigger budget deficits.  In the aggregate, the swing from oil producers to consumers is quite large.  For example, a $20 per barrel decline in global oil prices results in an income transfer of about $670 billion per year from producers to consumers.2  This understates the total effect because it does not include any knock-on reductions in other energy prices\u2014such as for natural gas\u2014that, outside the U.S., often are linked to oil prices.     \n\nObviously, if the oil price declines were to both intensify and persist, this would have negative implications for oil and gas investment in the U.S.  At a minimum, as cash flows fall, some producers will cut back on their drilling activity rather than plug the shortfall with outside financing.  \n\nNevertheless, there are several reasons why I don\u2019t think this risk should be overstated, especially if oil prices stabilize around current levels.  First, even after the large gains in recent years, oil and gas investment remains a small fraction of GDP.  Second, domestic natural gas investment should be relatively unaffected because U.S. natural gas prices are largely insensitive to global energy price developments.  This reflects the high costs associated with exporting natural gas and the fact that most of our oil production is used for transportation purposes.  Thus, the ability to substitute lower cost natural gas for oil is limited.  Third, extraction costs vary appreciably across the different major oil fields.  There is not a single critical price that will constrain production or investment.  Fourth, with respect to oil produced by fracking, productivity gains have cut drilling costs and raised oil production, so breakeven costs per barrel have been falling.  Finally, if oil investment were to soften, this would lead to lower breakeven costs as resources currently in short supply\u2014e.g., water, welders, housing and transport\u2014became more available and less expensive.  \n\nOf course, as with any forecast, there is some meaningful chance that growth will turn out to be either weaker or stronger than expected.  However, I believe that the risks around this forecast are reasonably well balanced.  The subsiding headwinds that I discussed earlier are the primary reason for seeing the downside risks as limited.  In contrast, the ongoing geopolitical risks remain substantial. \n\nAt the same time, several factors suggest that growth is unlikely to turn out to be substantially stronger than the consensus forecast.  First, the upside from housing relative to the forecast is likely limited.  Although there has been an impressive recovery of multi-family housing starts over the past few years, single-family housing starts are growing only slowly and are unlikely to climb much faster over the next year or two.  The demand for new homes is still hindered by tight credit conditions for homebuyers.  Mortgage lenders continue to be extremely risk averse in extending new credit, and mortgage availability to those with lower credit scores is still significantly constrained.  I don\u2019t anticipate that this situation will change in a material way any time soon.   \n\nSecond, because motor vehicle sales are now close to their pre-recession levels, the future growth impetus from this cyclical sector will likely also be restrained going forward.  Third, growth in the rest of the world has slowed slightly and the dollar has appreciated somewhat.  This will limit the growth in U.S. exports, and suggests that the trade sector is unlikely to provide much support to growth over the next year or two.    \n\nInflation: Lower Now, but Likely to Drift Gradually Higher Next Year\n\nLet me now turn to discuss the inflation outlook.  Inflation has been running below the Federal Reserve\u2019s objective of a 2 percent annualized rate for the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator.  For example, over the past twelve months, the overall PCE deflator has risen by 1.4 percent, and the core PCE deflator, which excludes food and energy, has increased by 1.6 percent.  Recently, the overall index has been pulled down by sharply lower oil and gasoline prices.  Also, I expect that core goods prices will be held down somewhat over the near-term by the recent appreciation of the U.S. dollar.  Nevertheless, I expect inflation will begin to move back towards our 2 percent objective in 2015.  As the economy expands and the labor market continues to tighten, resource slack should decline and this should gradually exert some upward pressure on prices.  Also, despite some softness in market-based measures of inflation compensation, inflation expectations still seem well-anchored and this should also work to pull inflation gradually higher.  \n\nImplications for Monetary Policy\n\nSo, what does this assessment of the growth and inflation outlook imply for monetary policy?  Since the September 2012 announcement of the Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities asset purchase program, there has been substantial improvement in the labor market outlook.  Recognizing its success in meeting the FOMC\u2019s stated objectives, the FOMC decided to end the asset purchase program at the end of October. \n\nNow that we have ended our asset purchase program, attention has turned to the monetary policy normalization process.  There are four important questions regarding this process: When to begin? How to begin? How fast to go? And, how far to go? Let me consider each question in turn. \n\nWith respect to the question of when to begin, it is still premature to begin to raise interest rates, that is, to \u201clift off\u201d from the zero lower bound.  As the FOMC concluded in its most recent statement: \u201cThe Committee anticipates, based on its current assessment, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time following the end of its asset purchase program this month.\u201d  \n\nBut this sentence should not be viewed as an iron-clad commitment unaffected by economic and financial developments.  The statement goes on to say: \u201cHowever, if incoming information indicates faster progress toward the Committee\u2019s employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than currently anticipated. Conversely, if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range are likely to occur later than currently anticipated.\u201d  In other words, the FOMC\u2019s monetary policy actions and the timing of lift-off will depend on how the economic outlook evolves, particularly with respect to the labor market and inflation.  \n\nIn considering the appropriate timing of lift-off, there are three important reasons to be patient.  First, the Committee is still undershooting both its employment and inflation objectives.  Unemployment is too high and inflation is too low.  Thus, monetary policy needs to be very accommodative in order to close these gaps relative to the Committee\u2019s objectives.  Second, when interest rates are at the zero lower bound, the risks of tightening a bit too early are likely to be considerably greater than the risks of tightening a bit too late.  A premature tightening might lead to financial conditions that are too restrictive, resulting in a weaker economy and, in turn, an aborted lift-off.  This would be problematic in that it would harm the Fed\u2019s credibility and, more importantly, would be difficult to rectify.  The U.S. experience during the Great Depression and the Japanese experience over the past two decades illustrate the risks of raising interest rates too soon, especially when inflation is running below the central bank\u2019s objective.  Finally, given the still high level of long-term unemployment and the outlook for inflation, there could be a significant benefit to allowing the economy to run \u201cslightly hot\u201d for a while in order to get those that have been unemployed for a long time working again.  I believe this can be done without jeopardizing our price stability objective.  If the long-term unemployed are not employed relatively soon, their job skills will erode further, reducing their long-term prospects for employment and, therefore, the productive capacity of the U.S. economy.  This would be a very unfortunate outcome for them, their families and the country. \n\nMarket expectations that lift-off will occur around mid-2015 seem reasonable to me.  Although that could change depending on how the economy evolves, my views on \u201cwhen\u201d do not differ appreciably from the most recent primary dealer and buy-side surveys undertaken by the New York Fed prior to the October FOMC meeting.3\n\nI hope the economic outlook evolves so that it will be appropriate to begin to raise interest rates sometime next year.  While raising interest rates is often portrayed as a difficult task for central bankers, in fact, given the events since the onset of the financial crisis, it would be a development to be truly excited about.  When the FOMC begins to raise its federal funds rate target, this would indicate that the U.S. economy is finally getting healthier, and that the Committee believes it is on a sustainable track to achieving its dual mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability.  That would be very good news, even if it were to cause a bump or two in financial markets.  \n\nSo, when the appropriate time comes, how is the process of monetary policy normalization likely to unfold?  In this regard, the revised policy normalization principles and plans that the FOMC released following the September FOMC meeting are informative.4   In particular, the Committee will begin to normalize monetary policy by first raising its target range for the federal funds rate and short-term interest rates will be the primary tool used for tightening monetary policy.  After lift-off looks sustainable and the federal funds rate is somewhat above the zero lower bound, the Committee will cease to reinvest those funds generated by maturing Treasury securities and prepayments of agency MBS securities.  The Committee anticipates that the balance sheet will gradually normalize passively as these assets run off, not actively via asset sales. \n\nThe effective federal funds rate will be pushed into a higher target range by raising the interest rate paid on excess reserves (IOER).  The overnight reverse repo repurchase (ON RRP) facility will play a secondary role, in the sense that it will be used \u201conly to the extent necessary\u201d to help put a floor under the federal funds rate, and it will be phased out when it is no longer needed.  \n\nWith respect to \u201chow fast\u201d the normalization process will proceed, that depends on two factors\u2014how the economy evolves, and how financial market conditions respond to movements in the federal funds rate target.  Financial market conditions mainly include, but are not necessarily limited to, the level of short- and long-term interest rates, credit spreads and availability, equity prices and the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  When the FOMC adjusts its short-term federal funds rate target, this does not directly influence the economy since little economic activity is linked to the federal funds rate.  Instead, monetary policy affects the economy as the current change in short-term interest rates and expectations about future monetary policy changes influence financial market conditions more broadly.  \n\nDevelopments in financial market conditions are thus an important element in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy to the economy.  Changes in financial market conditions influence economic growth through a number of channels.  For example, a stronger equity market raises household wealth and lowers the desired personal saving rate\u2014lifting consumer spending. A stronger equity market also reduces the cost of capital for business, which may help encourage greater investment spending.  Lower long-term interest rates push down business financing costs, which also supports investment spending.  At the same time, lower mortgage rates support housing demand and reduce household interest outlays.  A weaker dollar supports growth by making imports more expensive and by increasing export competitiveness.  The combined effect is to increase net exports. \n\nIf the linkage from the federal funds rate to financial market conditions were stable over time, there would be no need to focus on financial market conditions.  In a world in which the linkage was solid and unchanging, adjustments to the short-term interest rate and communication about future policy would have a predictable and reliable effect on financial market conditions.  Central bankers, then, could keep their focus narrowly on their policy rate. \n\nHowever, as has been very clear, especially in recent years, this linkage is not stable.  Thus, how much one pushes on the short-term interest rate lever depends, in part, on how financial market conditions respond to such adjustments.  Imagine driving a car where the connection between the gas pedal and the engine speed was variable and uncertain.  The driver would have to constantly monitor and adjust the pressure on the gas pedal to achieve the desired speed.  Similarly, we will have to monitor and adjust short-term interest rates to achieve financial market conditions consistent with achieving our labor market and inflation objectives.  All else equal, less responsiveness implies larger interest rate adjustments and vice versa.  \n\nQuickly, let me give two examples that illustrate how variable this linkage can be.  First, during the 2004-07 period, the FOMC tightened monetary policy nearly continuously, raising the federal funds rate from 1 percent to 5.25 percent in 17 steps.  However, during this period, 10-year Treasury note yields did not rise much, credit spreads generally narrowed and U.S. equity price indices moved higher.  Moreover, the availability of mortgage credit eased, rather than tightened.  As a result, financial market conditions did not tighten.  \n\nAs a result, financial conditions remained quite loose, despite the large increase in the federal funds rate.  With the benefit of hindsight, it seems that either monetary policy should have been tightened more aggressively or macroprudential measures should have been implemented in order to tighten credit conditions in the overheated housing sector.    \n\nSecond, during the financial crisis, especially during the fall of 2008, financial market conditions tightened dramatically even as the FOMC was cutting its federal funds rate target to zero.  Monetary accommodation turned out to be insufficient to produce an easing of financial market conditions, and the economy fell into a deep recession.  \n\nOver time, financial market conditions have become a much more important factor in evaluating the appropriate setting of monetary policy and the level of short-term interest rates.  This reflects several factors.  First, over the past few decades, as the U.S. capital markets have grown in size and scope, the U.S. financial system has become much less bank-centric.  This has loosened the linkage between the federal funds rate and financial market conditions.  Second, the U.S. economy and financial markets have become more interconnected globally.  Thus, the impact of U.S. monetary policy has become more diffused, and financial market conditions have come to depend increasingly not only on developments in the U.S., but also on developments elsewhere.  As an example, the low level of U.S. 10-year Treasury yields presumably is due, in part, to the fact that long-term interest rates in Europe and Japan are much lower. \n\nSo, if the effect of short-term rate changes on financial market conditions has become less predictable and more variable over time, what implications does this have for U.S. monetary policy?  From my perspective, there are three major implications that deserve attention.  \n\nFirst, when lift-off occurs, the pace of monetary policy normalization will depend, in part, on how financial market conditions react to the initial and subsequent tightening moves.  If the reaction is relatively large\u2014think of the response of financial market conditions during the so-called \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d during the spring and summer of 2013\u2014then this would likely prompt a slower and more cautious approach.  In contrast, if the reaction were relatively small or even in the wrong direction, with financial market conditions easing\u2014think of the response of long-term bond yields and the equity market as the asset purchase program was gradually phased out over the past year\u2014then this would imply a more aggressive approach.  The key point is this:  We will pursue the monetary policy stance that best generates the set of financial market conditions most consistent with achievement of the FOMC\u2019s dual mandate objectives.  This depends both on how financial market conditions respond to the Fed\u2019s policy actions and on how the real economy responds to the changes in financial conditions.  \n\nThe second major implication is to be cautious about overreliance on simple monetary policy rules, such as the Taylor Rule, that do not include measures of financial market conditions in their formulation.  As you may recall, in a Taylor Rule the nominal federal funds rate depends on an equilibrium or neutral real rate of interest\u2014which is assumed to be constant over time\u2014the deviation of the level of economic activity from estimates that would be consistent with long-run price stability and the deviation of inflation from the central bank\u2019s target. \n\nAs I have noted elsewhere, the Taylor Rule formulation has a number of characteristics that make it a useful input into the policy-setting process.  First, it very explicitly focuses on the two parameters\u2014the long-term inflation objective and the level of potential output consistent with that objective\u2014that map directly to the Federal Reserve\u2019s dual mandate objectives.  Second, standard Taylor Rules are self-equilibrating.  They respond to economic shocks and forecast errors in a way that pushes the economy back toward the central bank\u2019s objectives.  Market participants incorporating information about the rules in their price-setting decisions helps keep inflation expectations well-anchored.  Third, academic research shows that Taylor-type rules typically perform quite well across a wide range of economic models.  This is important because we want guides to policy that are robust; that is, guides that are not overly sensitive to model-specific assumptions about how the economy works, or how households and businesses alter their expectations and behavior in response to changes in monetary policy.5\n\nDespite these attractive features, I do not believe that simple policy rules can take the place of in-depth analysis of economic and financial market conditions.  While simple policy rules provide useful benchmarks to policymakers, their very virtue\u2014their simplicity\u2014is also a significant shortcoming.  Policy rules cannot capture all of the information that is relevant for policymaking.  In particular, such rules do not capture the fact that the linkage between the federal funds rate and financial market conditions can be very loose.  This is a critical shortcoming because this looseness affects the stability of the relationship between monetary policy and economic outcomes.  If the relationship between monetary policy, financial conditions and the real economy were stable over time, then following a relatively simple and unchanging policy rule would likely generate acceptable results.  However, if the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy is more variable and uncertain, as I believe it is, then an approach that takes this explicitly into consideration will be more effective. \n\nThe third implication that stems from the fact that financial market conditions matter in the conduct of monetary policy pertains to the so-called \u201cFed put\u201d with respect to equity prices.  The notion here is that because the Federal Reserve cares about unanticipated and undesired changes in financial market conditions, the Fed will respond to weakness in equity prices by easing monetary policy\u2014essentially providing a put to equity investors.  The expectation of such a put is dangerous because if investors believe it exists they will view the equity market as less risky.  This will cause investors to push equity market values higher, increasing the likelihood of an equity market bubble and, when such a bubble bursts, the potential for a sharp shock that could threaten financial stability and the economy.    \n\nLet me be clear, there is no Fed equity market put.  To put it another way, we do not care about the level of equity prices, or bond yields or credit spreads per se.  Instead, we focus on how financial market conditions influence the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy.  At times, a large decline in equity prices will not be problematic for achieving our goals.  For example, economic conditions may warrant a tightening of financial market conditions.  If this happens mainly via the channel of equity price weakness\u2014that is not a problem, as it does not conflict with our objectives.  In contrast, when we want financial market conditions to be extremely accommodative\u2014as has been the case in recent years when we have been far away from our employment and inflation objectives\u2014then we will take into consideration a broad set of developments with respect to interest rates, the stock market and other measures of financial conditions in choosing the appropriate stance for monetary policy.  \n\nBecause financial market conditions affect economic activity only slowly over time, this suggests that we should look through short-term volatility and movements in financial markets.  We should not respond until we become convinced that the movements will likely, without action on our part, prove sufficiently persistent to conflict with achievement of our objectives.  Often, financial markets can be quite volatile and move a lot without disturbing underlying economic performance.  \n\nFinally, let me turn to the issue of \u201chow much,\u201d in other words, what federal funds rate target over the long term is consistent with our employment and inflation objectives.  This issue is more difficult to judge for a number of reasons.  First, it depends on how financial conditions evolve in response to our monetary policy adjustments.  Second, it depends on other factors, such as potential real GDP growth, which in turn, depends on the growth of the labor force and productivity growth trends.  My current thinking, in this regard, is that the equilibrium federal funds rate consistent with 2 percent inflation will be somewhat lower in the future than in the past.  In part, this reflects the likelihood that potential real GDP growth will likely be somewhat lower going forward due to slower growth in the labor force.  But my confidence in this conclusion may change on the basis of incoming empirical evidence.  In fact, I suspect my views will evolve as I see how the economy responds over time to higher interest rates and tighter financial market conditions.   \n\nConclusion\n\nIn my remarks today, I have provided my current thinking about the U.S. growth and the inflation outlook, and the implications for monetary policy.  To sum up, the U.S. economic outlook looks brighter, with growth likely to be somewhat above the trend of the past five years.  The risks to growth appear generally balanced, without unusually high risks that growth will either be much stronger or weaker than my forecast.  On inflation, I remain confident, despite the recent softening, that inflation will begin to move up towards our 2 percent objective next year.  This move will not likely happen immediately, however, given the recent weakness in energy prices and the fact that non-energy import price trends are also likely to soften a bit over the near-term. \n\nWith respect to monetary policy, I believe that market expectations as captured by the most recent New York Fed\u2019s surveys of primary dealers and market participants are reasonable\u2014with lift-off expected to take place sometime around the middle of next year.  But, life is uncertain and my judgment of the appropriate timing could change in response to incoming data and other factors that change the economic outlook.  When we do begin to tighten monetary policy, the pace of tightening will depend not only on the outlook but also on how financial market conditions respond as we begin to remove monetary policy accommodation.  Financial market conditions are an important transmission mechanism of monetary policy.  This is why I don\u2019t favor indiscriminately adhering to simple policy rules that exclude financial market conditions.  \n\nI hope the FOMC can begin to raise its federal funds rate target next year.  This would signify that the economy has made sufficient progress towards the FOMC\u2019s objectives and that the time had finally come to begin to unwind the current high degree of monetary policy accommodation.  \n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n1 See, for example, the latest Blue Chip consensus survey (volume 39, no. 11, November 10, 2014).

    "content": "I. Introduction\n\nChairman Brown, Ranking Member Toomey, and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for this opportunity to testify on the effectiveness of financial institution supervision and the issue of regulatory capture.\n\nIn 2008 and 2009 our country faced its worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.  I mention those years as a touchstone for my remarks today.  Despite the passage of time and an economy that is steadily improving, the financial crisis is hardly something that happened in the remote past.  For the too many people who are still unemployed or underemployed, or who otherwise continue to struggle financially, it is living history.\n\nWhile the causes of the crisis remain subject to debate, it is undeniable that banking supervisors could have done better in their prudential oversight of the financial system.  This conclusion raises two fundamental questions:\n\nThe Federal Reserve is working diligently to improve both stability and supervision.  The two concepts are linked.  Since the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has made significant changes to the substance and process of supervision.  As a result, the financial system is unquestionably much stronger and much more stable now than it was five years ago. \n\nII. Substantive changes\n\nSince the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has redoubled its attention to bank capital.  Capital is the financial cushion that banks hold to absorb loss.1  It provides an economic firebreak that helps prevent systemic stress from turning into a full-blown crisis. \n\nBefore the crisis, capital requirements were too low and inconsistent across jurisdictions.  Moreover, too much of the capital held by banks was of poor quality, and their internal capital assessments were not forward-looking.2  Since the crisis, new regulation and heightened supervision have increased both the quantity and the quality of equity capital at the largest financial institutions that we regulate and supervise.  The Federal Reserve and other federal banking regulators implemented so-called \u201cBasel III\u201d international capital standards in July 2013, which raised the minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets.  Federal regulation also now requires stricter criteria for instruments to qualify as regulatory capital and higher risk weights for many classes of assets.  And the Federal Reserve mandated a new minimum supplementary leverage ratio that includes off-balance sheet exposures for the largest, most internationally active banking organizations and a leverage surcharge for large U.S. banking organizations. \n\nIn support of these new regulations, capital assessment has become a focus of supervision since the financial crisis.  Examiners monitor capital reserves and put banks through periodic stress tests that are evaluated on a cross-firm basis.  This has been one of the great advancements of bank oversight following the crisis.  These evaluations enable supervisors to assemble a composite assessment of the nation\u2019s banking sector, which materially assists the Federal Reserve in its statutory mandate to promote financial stability.3\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act mandates supervisory stress tests that assess whether large bank holding companies have a sufficient level of capital to absorb losses during adverse economic conditions.4  The Federal Reserve also conducts a capital planning exercise, called the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review or \u201cCCAR.\u201d  This evaluation combines the quantitative results from the Dodd-Frank Act stress tests with a qualitative assessment of whether the largest bank holding companies have vigorous, \u201cforward-looking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks.\u201d5  The criteria for both sets of stress tests are dynamic and change in response to evolving risks.  For example, past tests have assumed a sharp, sudden, and widespread drop in markets triggered by, say, a large Eurozone shock.  The tests also evaluate market interconnectedness, including the risk of major counterparty default. \n\nTo increase public transparency, the Federal Reserve now publishes the overall results of its stress tests.  This helps rebuild confidence in the strength of the financial system.  The most recent round of stress tests concluded in the first quarter of this year.  In my view, the results were encouraging, although not uniformly satisfying.  In general, \u201cfirms participating in CCAR have more than doubled their Tier 1 common capital since 2009, an increase of $500 billion of additional, high-quality capital in the U.S. financial system.\u201d6  This impressive statistic notwithstanding, the Federal Reserve objected to capital plans from five of the 30 participating firms.  Four of those five firms submitted plans that raised firm-specific, qualitative concerns.  The remaining firm failed to meet a minimum quantitative requirement.7 \n\nThe consequences of failing to pass a stress test can be severe.  If its capital plan has been rejected, the Federal Reserve may, among other things, restrict a bank holding company from paying or increasing dividends on its common stock or increasing any repurchase of its common stock, or both.8  For example, as a result of this year\u2019s CCAR, Citigroup was not permitted to begin a new common stock repurchase program or to increase its quarterly common stock dividend.9\n\nAs a companion to improved capital, the Federal Reserve also assesses liquidity\u2014that is, how quickly a bank can convert its assets into cash.  Prior to the crisis, liquidity practices did not generally anticipate the possibility of severe drops in the prices of saleable assets.  Following the crisis, the Federal Reserve imposed new liquidity regulations, including the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio.  The objective of these new regulations is to require large firms to hold levels of liquid assets sufficient to protect against constraints on their funding during times of financial turmoil.  We have also implemented liquidity stress test assessments for systemically important financial institutions.  These assessments provide important insight into the adequacy of liquidity positions and bank preparedness for upcoming regulatory standards.\n\nBeyond capital and liquidity, the Federal Reserve has increased its focus on risk management practices at the largest and most systemically important financial institutions.  We learned from the crisis that risk management in the financial services industry had not always kept pace with changing market practices.  We have responded in several ways.\n\nFor example, we have paid greater supervisory attention to corporate governance.  We significantly increased the depth and frequency of interaction between senior supervisors from the Federal Reserve and directors and executives at banks.  This supplements our ongoing assessment of management\u2019s oversight of risk.  Our review entails a critical analysis not only of firm policies, procedures and limits, but also of the quality of the risk reports escalated to senior management, the capabilities of the firm\u2019s risk monitoring program, and the adequacy of control functions. \n\nWe have also increased our enforcement activity for violations of law or unsafe or unsound conduct.  Since 2009 the Federal Reserve has taken 36 public enforcement actions against institutions supervised by the New York Fed, which included $1.2 billion in fines.  On top of this, five firms supervised by the New York Fed paid $1.3 billion into a qualified settlement fund for mortgage borrowers, and the same five institutions were required to provide over $2 billion in other foreclosure prevention assistance.  These statistics do not include non-public enforcement actions, including restrictions on the further growth of banks that do not have satisfactory risk management regimes.  And, earlier this year, we assisted in consigning the concept of \u201ctoo big to jail\u201d to history when Credit Suisse and BNP Paribas pleaded guilty to criminal charges.  I am gratified that the Attorney General and the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York have acknowledged the work of the Federal Reserve in supporting our law enforcement partners.10\n\nThe New York Fed has also devoted significant resources and attention to the reform of bank culture and conduct.  Increased capital and liquidity are important tools to promote financial stability, but in the end a bank is only as trustworthy as the people who work within it.  I have personally delivered a strong message that the culture of Wall Street is unacceptable.11  Bad conduct by bankers damages the public trust placed in banks.  In my view, this loss of trust is so severe that it has become a financial stability concern.  If bad behavior persists, it would not be unreasonable\u2014and may even be inevitable\u2014for one to conclude that large firms are too big and complex to manage effectively. \n\nOur nation\u2019s largest financial institutions need to repair the loss of public trust in banks.  This means a back-to-basics assessment of the purpose of banking, including duties owed to the public in exchange for the privileges banks receive through their bank charters and other functions of law.  Among these privileges are deposit insurance and access to a lender of last resort. \n\nAs part of this effort, I have proposed four specific reforms to curb incentives for illegal and unduly risky conduct at banks.  First, banks should extend the deferral period for compensation to match the timeframe for legal liabilities to materialize\u2014perhaps as long as a decade.  Second, banks should create de facto performance bonds wherein deferred compensation for senior managers and material risk takers could be used to satisfy fines against the firm for banker misbehavior.  Third, I have urged Congress to enact new federal legislation creating a database that tracks employees dismissed for illegal or unethical behavior.  Fourth, I have requested that Congress amend the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to impose a mandatory ban from the financial system\u2014that is, both the regulated and shadow banking sectors\u2014for any person convicted of a crime of dishonesty while employed at a financial institution.\n\nIII. Supervisory process\n\nIn tandem with our attention to capital, liquidity, and risk management, we have made important changes to the process of supervision. \n\nFor starters, the Federal Reserve now makes its most consequential supervisory decisions on a system-wide level through the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee or \u201cLISCC.\u201d  The committee comprises representatives across professional disciplines from several Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors.  The New York Fed supplies only three of its 16 members.  LISCC sets supervisory policy for the 15 largest, most systemically important financial institutions in our country and develops innovative, objective, and quantitative methods for assessing these firms on a comparative basis.  LISCC also coordinates the supervision of the largest supervised institutions through its Operating Committee, which reviews and approves supervisory plans for exams, receives regular updates on major supervisory issues, and makes material supervisory decisions regarding matters that affect the firms\u2019 safety and soundness.  In this respect, the Operating Committee provides an important safeguard against regulatory capture by ensuring that no one person or Reserve Bank has the power to make a final decision on a matter of significance.\n\nAnother procedural change is our increased application of cross-firm, horizontal review.  This technique enables peer-to-peer comparison of banks, facilitates a better assessment of the overall health of the financial system, and safeguards against regulatory capture by providing insight from across the Federal Reserve System.  The analysis is done not only at the level of the Board of Governors\u2014for example, through CCAR and Dodd-Frank stress testing\u2014but also within the New York Fed.  We hold weekly discussions among senior supervisory and risk officers to identify developing concerns that may pose a systemic risk.  A current subject of horizontal analysis is leveraged loans\u2014specifically, whether lax underwriting practices for such loans could pose a significant risk to financial stability. \n\nIn addition, we have reorganized the supervision group at the New York Fed in a number of ways that promote unbiased analysis and professional objectivity.  Many of these changes directly reflect the recommendations in a 2009 report that I commissioned from David Beim, which was featured in the recent This American Life program about supervision at the New York Fed.  For example:\n\nEach and together, these improvements to the substance and process of supervision contribute to financial stability by providing greater insight into bank resiliency and risk.  But these enhancements are not self-executing.  They depend on the hundreds of examiners who are dedicated professionals working in the public interest.  Our examiners fulfill their obligations with considerable care, mindful of the stakes to Main Street when something goes wrong on Wall Street.  I am grateful for their efforts.\n\nIV. Reasonable expectations\n\nBefore concluding, let me offer a broader view of what we at the Federal Reserve expect from prudential supervision.  Very briefly, I submit that supervision should be fair, conscientious, and effective. \n\nFair supervision means that the rules are applied consistently across the firms we supervise.  We all need to know the rules and follow the same rule book.  It also entails a commitment to independence from business or political influence, as envisioned by the Federal Reserve Act one hundred years ago.\n\nConscientious supervision means we must be committed to sustained and, if necessary, radical self-improvement.  The Beim report is an example of our willingness to commission and accept self-critical analysis and our commitment to improve.  But we cannot stop there.  To this end, we will be working with the Board of Governors on its upcoming review of whether the LISCC Operating Committee receives information that is sufficient to reach sound supervisory decisions.  One subset of this system-wide inquiry will analyze regulatory capture\u2014specifically, how divergent views are presented to decision makers at the Board.  The review is expected to take several months. \n\nEffective supervision means tough supervision and demands a focus on large banks that pose systemic risk.  Bank supervisors cannot prevent all fraud or illegal conduct or forestall all undesirable behavior in large, complex financial institutions.  But we can help create more resilient, less complex, and better managed organizations that promote, rather than undermine, financial stability.\n\nV. Conclusion\n\nThe Federal Reserve will continue to improve its supervision and regulation of financial institutions.  We understand the risks of doing our job poorly and of becoming too close to the firms we supervise.  We work hard to avoid these risks and to be as fair, conscientious, and effective as possible.  Of course, we are not perfect.  We cannot catch or correct every error by a financial institution, and we sometimes make mistakes.  But in my view, a good measure of the effectiveness of supervision is the improved strength and stability of banks since the financial crisis.  Thanks in part to enhanced supervision and regulation, banks \u201chave the ability to meet their financial obligations and continue to make a broad variety of financial products and services available to households and businesses even in times of economic difficulty.\u201d12  I can promise you that we will always strive to improve and that we will work hard to earn and retain your trust. \n\nI look forward to taking questions.\n\n1 I use the terms \u201cbank\u201d and \u201cfinancial institution\u201d interchangeably, but note that the two terms are not synonymous in federal regulation.\n\n2 See Joint Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, \u201cRegulatory Capital Rules: Regulatory Capital, Implementation of Basel III, Minimum Regulatory Capital Ratios, Capital Adequacy, Transition Provisions, and Prompt Corrective Action,\u201d June 12, 2012, at 32.\n\n3 See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 5365(a)(1).\n\n4 See 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 5365(i).\n\n5 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Press Release, October 23, 2014.\n\n6 Daniel Tarullo, \u201cStress Testing after Five Years,\u201d Remarks at the Federal Reserve Third Annual Stress Test Modeling Symposium, Boston, Massachusetts, June 25, 2014.\n\n7 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review 2014: Assessment Framework and Results, March 2014, at 7-8.\n\n8 See 12 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 225.8(c)(2) and (e)(2)(iv).\n\n9 See Citigroup, Inc., \u201cCiti Statement on 2014 CCAR Results,\u201d March 26, 2014.\n\n10 See U.S. Department of Justice, \u201cBNP Paribas Agrees To Plead Guilty To Conspiring To Process Transactions Through The U.S. Financial System For Sudanese, Iranian, And Cuban Entities Subject To U.S. Economic Sanctions,\u201d June 30, 2014.  \n\n11 See William Dudley, \u201cEnding Too Big to Fail,\u201d Remarks at the Global Economic Policy Forum, New York City, November 7, 2013; William Dudley, \u201cEnhancing Financial Stability by Improving Culture in the Financial Services Industry,\u201d Remarks at the Workshop on Reforming Culture and Behavior in the Financial Services Industry, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, New York City, October 20, 2014.\n\n12 Scott G.

    "content": "It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak with you here today.   In my remarks, I will assess the outlook for the U.S. economy and the progress that the Federal Reserve has made toward its dual mandate objectives of maximum employment in the context of price stability.  I will argue that we are now closer to achieving these objectives.  That is the reason why the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) ended its latest Treasury and agency MBS asset purchase program last month.  But we still have further to go.  Although the U.S. labor market has shown substantial improvement, there still is a meaningful gap between where we are and full employment.  Also, inflation continues to undershoot the FOMC\u2019s 2 percent objective.\n\nThis argues for patience with respect to the timing of lift-off of the federal funds rate and the beginning of the normalization of monetary policy.  Although patience is appropriate, if all goes well, I anticipate that we will begin to raise short-term rates sometime next year.  That would be a welcome development, because it would indicate that the U.S. economy has largely recovered from the damage caused by the housing boom and bust, and the financial crisis. \n\nHowever, we need to be mindful that this shift in policy most likely will be accompanied by some degree of market turbulence.  Moreover, the normalization of U.S. monetary policy could create significant challenges for those emerging market economies (EMEs) that have been the recipients of large capital inflows in recent years.  This leads to an important question: what can the Federal Reserve do to address these risks? \n\nI will make three observations about the potential international spillovers from normalizing U.S. monetary policy.  First, what we may see in terms of market strains and macroeconomic adjustment during this normalization process will not be new.  Changes in Fed policy, and especially the tightening of monetary policy, have often created challenges for countries abroad, especially EMEs.  Second, these EMEs, as a group, are better equipped today to handle those challenges than in the past.  This reflects the fundamental improvements and stronger policy frameworks that many of these countries have put in place over the past 15 years.  Third, given the dollar\u2019s role as the global reserve currency, the Federal Reserve has a special responsibility to manage U.S. monetary policy appropriately in order to promote global financial stability.\n\nAs always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the FOMC or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nThe U.S. Economic Outlook and the Implications for Monetary Policy\n\nSince the official end of the Great Recession more than five years ago, the U.S. economy has grown at a disappointing 2.3 percent annualized rate.  Several times over that period, it appeared that growth was breaking out on the upside and forecasts were raised, but each time such hopes were disappointed.  We are again at a similar junction.  Over the past two quarters, the pace of economic growth has picked up.  In particular, real GDP rose at a 3.5 percent annual rate last quarter, and is widely expected to grow at around a 2\u00bd to 3 percent annual rate through the end of 2015.\n\nThis time, however, I believe that we are less likely to be disappointed.  That is because several of the various \u201cheadwinds\u201d that have impeded U.S. economic activity in recent years have subsided.  This allows the improving underlying fundamentals to exert themselves more forcefully.  For example, fiscal restraint, which had a significant impact on economic growth last year, has abated, and is likely to disappear altogether next year.  Credit availability has also improved, reflecting healthier bank balance sheets and improving job and income prospects for potential borrowers.  In addition, the excess supply of housing that built up during the boom of the previous decade has been worked off. \n\nThis lessening of headwinds has allowed supportive financial market conditions spurred, in part, by very accommodative monetary policy to shine through.  As a result, I expect that both consumption and business investment spending will strengthen over the next few quarters.  On the consumer side, household balance sheets are now healthier, reflecting higher aggregate household net worth relative to income and less leverage.  Also, sturdy employment gains and falling energy prices are boosting real income growth.  Together with accommodative financial conditions, this should lend support to further gains in consumer spending.\n\nSimilarly, despite some recent market turbulence, conditions on the business side are supportive to sustained gains in investment.  Credit to businesses is generally readily available, cash flows are strong and corporate balance sheets are healthy. \n\nThe energy sector is another bright spot that has been supporting business investment and the U.S. economy.  New extraction technologies have had a dramatic impact on this sector, with natural gas production up 15 percent since 2010, and crude oil production up a remarkable 35 percent.2  Moreover, natural gas prices have fallen significantly in recent years and are far lower than those in most other industrialized economies.  These developments have dramatically boosted jobs and incomes in these industries, with beneficial spillovers to manufacturing competitiveness more generally. \n\nOf course, as with any forecast, there is some meaningful chance that growth will turn out to be either weaker or stronger than expected.  However, I believe that the risks around this forecast are reasonably well balanced, and that the likelihood that growth will be substantially weaker or stronger than the forecast is relatively low.  The subsiding headwinds that I discussed earlier are the primary reason for seeing the downside risks as limited.  At the same time, there are a few factors that suggest that there is a relatively low likelihood of growth ending up substantially above the forecast.\n\nThree considerations seem important for assessing the degree of upside risk to growth.  First, the upside from housing is likely limited compared to what one might expect under more normal conditions.  We have seen an impressive recovery of multi-family housing starts over the past few years.  In contrast, starts of single-family homes remain at low levels despite the fact that home prices have risen substantially over the past two years and mortgage rates have remained low.  A contributing factor is that mortgage lenders continue to be extremely risk averse, and mortgage credit to those with lower credit scores is still significantly constrained.  There is little on the horizon that would lead me to believe that this situation will change in a material way any time soon.  Second, because motor vehicle sales are now close to their pre-recession levels, the future growth impetus from this cyclical sector probably will also be restrained.  Finally, growth in the rest of the world has slowed and the dollar has appreciated somewhat.  This will limit the growth in U.S. exports, and suggests that the trade sector is unlikely to be a strong wind at the back of the U.S. economy over the next year or two.   \n\nWith respect to prices, inflation has been running somewhat below the Federal Reserve\u2019s objective of a 2 percent annualized rate for the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator.  For example, over the past twelve months, the overall PCE deflator has risen by 1.4 percent, and the core PCE deflator, which excludes food and energy, has increased by 1.5 percent.  Moreover, for the next few months, inflation is likely to moderate further as the impact of falling gasoline prices and the firmer dollar feed into the official U.S. inflation statistics.  Thereafter, I expect that inflation will begin to move back towards our 2 percent objective, pushed there as slack in the economy continues to diminish and pulled there by well-anchored inflation expectations. \n\nIn assessing inflation expectations, I currently put more weight on survey-based measures of inflation expectations as opposed to market-based measures.  Survey-based measures have been generally stable, consistent with inflation expectations remaining well-anchored.  However, market-based measures, such as those based on breakeven inflation derived from the difference between yields on nominal versus Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), have registered declines over the past few months, even on a 5-years forward basis.  Research done by my staff suggests that much of this decline in market-based measures of inflation compensation reflects a fall in the inflation risk premium\u2014that is, what investors are willing to pay to protect themselves against inflation risk.  Adjusting for the fall in the inflation risk premium, inflation expectations appear to have declined much less than implied by TIPS inflation breakeven measures.  \n\nSo what does this assessment of the outlook imply for monetary policy?  Since September 2012, when the last program of asset purchases was announced, there has been substantial improvement in the labor market outlook.  Because the asset purchase program had fulfilled the FOMC\u2019s stated objectives, the FOMC decided to end the program last month.  At the same time, it still is premature to begin to raise interest rates\u2014there remains slack in the labor market and the inflation rate is still too low.  Hence, the last FOMC statement states: \u201cThe Committee anticipates, based on its current assessment, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time following the end of its asset purchase program this month.\u201d  But this sentence should not be viewed as an iron-clad commitment.  As the statement goes on to say: \u201cHowever, if incoming information indicates faster progress toward the Committee\u2019s employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than currently anticipated.  Conversely, if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range are likely to occur later than currently anticipated.\u201d  In other words, what the FOMC does going forward will depend on how the economy evolves, and how this affects the labor market and the inflation outlook. \n\nIn considering the appropriate timing of lift-off, there are three important reasons to be patient.  First, the Committee is still undershooting both its employment and inflation objectives.  Unemployment is too high and inflation is too low.  Thus, monetary policy needs to be very accommodative in order to close these gaps relative to the Committee\u2019s objectives.  Second, when interest rates are at the zero lower bound, the risks of tightening a bit too early seem considerably greater than the risks of tightening a bit too late.  A premature tightening might lead to financial conditions that are too tight, resulting in a weaker economy and an aborted lift-off.  This would be problematic in that it would harm the Fed\u2019s credibility and, more importantly, would be difficult to rectify.  The U.S. experience during the Great Depression and the Japanese experience over the past two decades illustrate the risks of raising interest rates too soon, especially when inflation is running below the central bank\u2019s objective.  Finally, given the still high level of long-term unemployment, there could be a significant benefit to allowing the economy to run \u201cslightly hot\u201d for a while in order to get these people employed again.  If they are not employed relatively soon, their job skills will erode further, reducing their long-term prospects for employment and, therefore, the productive capacity of the U.S. economy.\n\nAll that said, I hope the economic outlook evolves so that it will be appropriate to begin to raise interest rates sometime next year.  While raising interest rates is often portrayed as a difficult task for central bankers, in fact, given the events since the onset of the financial crisis, it would be a development to be truly excited about.  Raising interest rates would signal that the U.S. economy is finally getting healthier, and that the Fed is getting closer to achieving its dual mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability.  That would be very good news, even if it were to cause a bump or two in financial markets.\n\nGlobal Implications of U.S. Monetary Policy Normalization\n\nLet me now turn to the implication of U.S. policy normalization for foreign economies. Like other central banks, our monetary policy mandate has a domestic focus.  Our monetary policy actions, though, often have global implications that feed back into the U.S. economy and financial markets, and we need to always keep this in mind.  For most of us, the market volatility that we saw in the spring and summer of 2013 during the so-called \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d still remains fresh in our minds.  EME financial markets were hit the hardest, with declines in equity prices, a widening in sovereign debt spreads and a sharp increase in foreign exchange rate volatility.  In the U.S., we saw a spike in Treasury yields, with the 10-year rate rising by more than 100 basis points from early May before peaking in early September.\n\nMost commentary about the catalyst for these moves has focused on the shift in expectations with respect to U.S. monetary policy\u2014and, in particular, to uncertainty about the timing and implications of Fed tapering.  This focus seems generally right to me, although other factors also played a role.\n\nFrom one perspective, the unconventional nature of recent U.S. monetary policy adds little that is fundamentally new to the challenges that face EMEs.  These policies simply represent a way of easing that was necessitated by hitting the zero lower bound on the federal funds rate.  Central bankers have managed differences across countries in cyclical positions and policy stances many times in the past.  This time should not be fundamentally different.\n\nBut, from another perspective, we have less experience operating with unconventional monetary policy, and this creates more potential uncertainties.  These uncertainties put a premium on keen listening skills on our part and clear communication among central bankers as well as between central bankers and market participants.  In my view, an important fact is that our large scale asset purchase programs affect the size of term risk premia globally.  This new set of monetary policies affects financial asset prices in a different way compared to changes in short-term interest rates, and we should be humble regarding what we claim to understand about this distinction.\n\nLooking ahead, it seems likely that markets will remain focused on vulnerabilities that they might have ignored prior to the taper tantrum in 2013.  The greater premium on strong fundamentals, policy coherence and predictability will likely remain.  There will be no one right answer in managing the trade-offs that come with the changed environment, and adjustment will sometimes be difficult.  We will undoubtedly experience further bumps in the road.  The renewed volatility we saw last month is evidence enough of that.  Yet, I think we can remain generally optimistic about the prospects for adjustment so long as market participants continue to appropriately discriminate across countries, rather than treating EMEs as a single group.\n\nFurthermore, many EMEs generally appear to be better equipped today to handle the Fed's prospective exit from its exceptional policy accommodation than they were during past tightening cycles.  This reflects the fundamental reforms that EMEs have put in place over the past 15 years, as well as the hard lessons learned from past periods of market stress. Among the positives are:\n\nOf course, progress has not been uniform across EMEs, and more work remains to further strengthen institutional structures in some countries.  In particular, vulnerabilities remain in several important EMEs, and some EMEs are now being hit by a sharp adverse turn in their terms of trade due to the recent fall in global commodity prices.  Still, the fundamental improvements I\u2019ve cited leave many EMEs better positioned than in the past to weather those times in the cycle when the external environment becomes more difficult.\n\nThe impact that changes in Fed policy can have beyond our borders has led to calls for us to do more to internalize those impacts, or even further, to internationally coordinate policymaking.  As I\u2019ve already noted, we are mindful of the global effects of Fed policy, given the central place of U.S. markets in the global financial system and the dollar\u2019s status as the global reserve currency.  Accordingly, we seek to conduct policy transparently and based on clear principles.  Promoting growth and stability in the U.S., I believe, is the most important contribution we can make to growth and stability worldwide.\n\nThere is, of course, the argument that Fed policy has been too accommodative for too long, creating risks for financial stability worldwide.  Here, I think it\u2019s important to consider carefully the counterfactual.  Would countries beyond our borders really have been better off with a weaker U.S. economy\u2014an economy that might have required exceptional monetary policy accommodation for a much longer period of time?  The fundamental issue is whether U.S. monetary policy has helped support our dual objectives of maximum employment in the context of price stability, and whether this support is consistent with a healthy global economy.\n\nMoreover, it is far from clear that explicitly coordinated policy would produce better outcomes for the global economy generally, or EMEs specifically.  Central banks face enough challenges in tailoring policies to their own domestic circumstances.  I believe that it would be taking on too much to attempt to collectively fashion policy in reference to global conditions.  Monetary policy meant to suit everybody is likely in the end to suit nobody.  Similar considerations underlie the widespread move in the emerging world away from fixed exchange rate regimes.  Policymakers worldwide have learned that a framework capable of responding in a disciplined but flexible manner to changing domestic conditions works best over the long run.\n\nWhile explicit coordination looks neither feasible nor desirable, there is more that central banks in general, and the Fed in particular, could do to be better global stewards.  As an example, recent events demonstrate the importance of effective Fed communication.  It is clear, in retrospect, that our attempts in the spring of 2013 to provide guidance about the potential timing and pace of tapering confused market participants.  Market participants seemed to conflate the prospective tapering of asset purchases with monetary policy tightening, and pulled forward their expectations about the likely timing of liftoff and raised their expected paths for policy rates.  Lately, we seem to have done better: market participants now seem to share the Committee\u2019s current assessment that policy rates will likely remain exceptionally low for a considerable period of time, even now that the asset purchase program has been completed. \n\nAs you know, we\u2019ve taken a number of steps in recent years to increase transparency and improve our communications.  This includes regular press conferences by the Fed chair following FOMC meetings; the publishing of growth, inflation and short-term rate forecasts of FOMC participants; and a concerted attempt to lay out the guideposts that the FOMC will look at to assess progress toward our mandate.  We are, though, still learning how to more effectively communicate, especially given our new and expanded set of policy instruments.\n\nA second area in which we can and must do better is safeguarding financial stability.  Simply put, we failed to act both early enough and decisively enough to stem the credit excesses that spawned the financial crisis and the Great Recession.  The U.S. was not alone in this shortcoming, but given our position in the global financial system, we especially should have done better.  We've taken important steps through new legislative mandates and a broader effort to rethink our regulatory and supervisory framework.  In particular, systemically important banking organizations must now hold amounts of capital and liquidity that are better aligned with their risk profiles, and the official sector is making progress in ensuring no financial firm will be too-big-to-fail.\n\nAll of this remains very much a work in progress.  But, these efforts should help us to avoid repeating the mistakes of the recent past, and enable us to take a more proactive stance toward mitigating potential future vulnerabilities.  Of course, we at the Fed are not alone here.  Since the recent financial crisis, central banks worldwide have been engaged in a broad rethinking of how to better fulfill their mandates.\n\nLet me close with a final thought.  The largest problems that countries create for others often emanate from getting policy wrong domestically.  Recession or instability at home is often quickly exported.  Equally important, growth and stability abroad makes all our jobs easier.  This means that there are externalities in the work we do, so that more effective fulfillment of our domestic mandates helps to bring us collectively to a better place.  Ensuring global growth and stability is and will remain our joint and common endeavor.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.\n\n1 Agria Sbordone, Thomas Klitgaard, Jonathan McCarthy and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing this speech.\n\n2 See Table 1.2 in the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Monthly Energy Review, October 2014."

    "content": "If all goes according to our forecast and the U.S. economy continues to make progress towards the Fed\u2019s dual mandate goals of maximum sustainable employment and 2 percent inflation, the Federal Reserve will likely begin to raise its federal funds rate target off the zero lower bound sometime next year.  For the United States, the start of the normalization of U.S. monetary policy will be a very welcome development.  It will indicate that the U.S. economy has made great strides in healing itself from the damage caused by the U.S. housing boom and bust, and the financial crisis. \n\nHowever, this shift in policy will undoubtedly be accompanied by some degree of market turbulence.  Moreover, it could create significant challenges for those emerging market economies (EMEs) that have been the beneficiaries of large capital inflows in recent years.  What can the Federal Reserve do to minimize these risks?   These are some of the very important issues raised by Helene Rey\u2019s work.\n\nLet me begin by highlighting some of the key points I will be making.  As always, the thoughts I offer today are my own, and should not be interpreted as representing the position of the FOMC or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nFirst, what we may see in terms of market strains and macroeconomic adjustment during this normalization process will not be new.  Changes in Fed policy, and especially the tightening of monetary policy, have often created challenges for countries abroad, especially in EMEs.  Second, these countries, as a group, are better equipped today to handle those challenges than at perhaps any time in the past.  This reflects the fundamental improvements and stronger policy frameworks that many EMEs have put in place over the past 15 years.  Third, given the dollar\u2019s role as the global reserve currency, the Federal Reserve has a special responsibility to manage U.S. monetary policy in a way that helps promote global financial stability.\n\nLike other central banks, our monetary policy mandate has a domestic focus.  But, our actions often have global implications that feed back into the U.S. economy and financial markets, and we need to always keep this in mind.  For most of us, the market volatility that we saw during the so-called \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d in the spring and summer of 2013 still remains fresh in our minds.  EME financial markets were hit hardest, with declines in equity prices, a widening in sovereign debt spreads and a sharp increase in foreign exchange rate volatility.  In the U.S., we saw a spike in Treasury yields, with the 10-year rate rising by more than 100 basis points from early May before peaking in early September.\n\nMost commentary about this period has focused on the shift in expectations with respect to U.S. monetary policy\u2014and, in particular, to uncertainty about the timing and implications of Fed tapering\u2014as the catalyst for these moves.  This focus seems generally right to me, although other factors also played a role.1\n\nFrom one perspective, the unconventional nature of recent U.S. monetary policy adds little that is fundamentally new to the challenges that face the EMEs.  These policies simply represent a way of easing, necessitated by our coming up against the zero lower bound.  Central bankers have managed differences across countries in cyclical positions and policy stances many times in the past.  This time should not be fundamentally different.  But, from another perspective, we have less experience operating with unconventional monetary policy, and this creates more potential uncertainties.  These uncertainties put a premium on keen listening skills on our part and continued dialogue both among central bankers as well as between central bankers and the market.  In my view, it is important to recognize that our large scale asset purchase programs affect the size of term risk premia globally.  This new set of monetary policies affects financial asset prices in a different way compared to changes in short-term interest rates, and we should be humble regarding what we claim about our understanding of the importance of this distinction.\n\nLooking ahead, it seems likely that markets will remain focused on vulnerabilities that they might have ignored prior to the taper tantrum in 2013.  The greater premium on strong fundamentals, policy coherence and predictability will likely remain.  There will be no one right answer in managing the trade-offs that come with the changed environment, and adjustment will sometimes be difficult.  Moreover, we will undoubtedly experience further bumps in the road.  The renewed volatility we saw last month is evidence enough of that.  Yet, I think we can remain generally optimistic on the outlook so long as market participants continue to appropriately discriminate across countries, rather than treating EMEs as a homogenous group.\n\nFurthermore, many EMEs generally appear to be better equipped today to handle the Fed's prospective exit from its exceptional policy accommodation than they were in past tightening cycles.  This reflects the fundamental reforms these EMEs have put in place over the past 15 years, as well as the hard lessons they learned from past periods of market stress.  Among the positives are:\n\nOf course, progress has not been uniform across EMEs, and more work remains to further strengthen institutional structures in some countries.  In particular, vulnerabilities remain in several important EMEs.  Still, the fundamental improvements I\u2019ve cited leave many EMEs better positioned than in the past to weather those times in the cycle when the external environment turns from welcoming to wary.\n\nThe impact that changes in Fed policy can have beyond our borders has led to calls for us to do more to internalize those impacts, or even further, to internationally coordinate policymaking.  As I\u2019ve already noted, Fed policies have significant effects internationally, given the central place of U.S. markets in the global financial system and the dollar\u2019s status as the global reserve currency.  In pursuing our policy responsibilities, we seek to conduct policy transparently and based on clear principles.  We are mindful of the global effects of Fed policy.  Promoting growth and stability in the U.S., I believe, is the most important contribution we can make to growth and stability worldwide.\n\nThere is, of course, the argument that Fed policy has been too accommodative for too long, creating risks for financial stability worldwide.  Here, I think it\u2019s important to consider carefully the counterfactual.  Would countries beyond our borders really have been better off with a weaker U.S. economy?  The fundamental issue is whether U.S. monetary policy has helped support our dual objectives of stable prices and maximum sustainable growth, and whether this support is consistent with a healthy global economy.\n\nMoreover, it is far from clear that explicitly coordinated policy would produce better outcomes for the global economy generally, or the EMEs specifically.  Central banks have challenges enough in tailoring policies to their own domestic circumstances.  I believe that it would be taking on too much to attempt to collectively fashion policy in reference to global conditions.  Monetary policy meant to suit everybody is likely in the end to suit nobody.  Similar considerations underlie the widespread move in the emerging world away from fixed exchange rate regimes.  Policymakers worldwide have learned that a framework capable of responding in a disciplined but flexible manner to changing domestic conditions works best over the long run.\n\nWhile explicit coordination looks neither feasible nor desirable, there is more that central banks in general, and the Fed in particular, could do to be better global stewards.  As an example, recent events demonstrate the importance of effective Fed communication.  It is clear in retrospect that our attempts in the spring of 2013 to provide guidance about the potential timing and pace of tapering confused market participants.  In particular, markets seemed to conflate tapering with monetary policy tightening and raised their expected paths for policy rates.  Lately, we seem to have done better: markets now seem to understand that policy rates will likely remain exceptionally low for a considerable period of time even now that the asset purchase program has been completed. \n\nAs you know, we\u2019ve taken a number of steps in recent years to increase transparency and improve our communications.  This includes regular press conferences following Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings by the Fed chair; the publishing of growth and inflation forecasts of FOMC participants; and a concerted attempt to lay out the guideposts that the FOMC will look at to assess progress toward our mandate.  We are, though, still learning how to more effectively communicate, especially given our new and expanded set of policy instruments.\n\nA second area in which we can and must do better is safeguarding financial stability.  Simply put, we failed to act both early enough and decisively enough to stem the credit excesses that spawned the financial crisis and the Great Recession.  The U.S. was not alone in this shortcoming, but given our position in the global financial system, we especially should have done better.  We've taken important steps reflecting both new legislative mandates and a broader effort to rethink our regulatory and supervisory framework.  In particular, systemically important banking organizations must now hold amounts of capital and liquidity that are better aligned with their risk profiles, compensation schemes for these institutions will be more focused on rewarding long-term results and the official sector is making progress in solving the \"too-big-to-fail\" dilemma.\n\nAll of this remains very much a work in progress.  But, these efforts should help us to avoid repeating the mistakes of the recent past, and to take a more proactive stance toward mitigating potential future vulnerabilities.  Of course, we at the Fed are not alone here.  Since the recent financial crisis, central banks worldwide have been engaged in a broad rethinking of how to better fulfill their mandates.\n\nLet me close with a final thought.  The largest problems that countries create for others often emanate from getting policy wrong domestically.  Recession or instability at home is often quickly exported.  Equally important, growth and stability abroad makes all our jobs easier.  This means that there are externalities in the work we do, so that more effective fulfillment of our domestic mandates helps to bring us to a better place collectively.  Ensuring global growth and stability is and will remain our joint and common endeavor.\n\n1 Market participants also had to evaluate the possibility that growth in China and other EMEs might be slowing even as growth in the U.S. and other advanced economies was picking up. The subsequent market movements as investors withdrew funds from EME investments were an abrupt shock for these EMEs generally, especially after the long earlier period of abundant liquidity and ample inflows."

    "content": "Introduction\nI would like to thank the New York Bankers Association for inviting me to speak today.  I appreciate the opportunity to address this group and to continue the dialogue that I've been having with many of you in various forums over the past several years.  As always, my remarks reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe last time I spoke to you in this setting was three years ago, when I spoke about the new era of supervision, modifications in our approach to supervision in response to lessons learned from the crisis, and the need to be better prepared for future crises.  I focused on the Framework for Supervision, which pushed for firms to be more resilient, less complex and better managed.  I also spoke about the structural changes that we made in our supervision area and our plans for the future.\n\nToday, I will provide an update on the Framework and progress in addressing weaknesses identified through the crisis.  I will share some of the challenges we see in the road ahead as the industry continues to adapt to and implement necessary changes.  And then I'll finish with a brief discussion of two of the issues that keep me awake at night. \n\nProgress to Date\nThree years ago, I encouraged you to acknowledge that it is impossible to predict the nature or timing of a future crisis event.  I posed a question about what a financial system better prepared to weather all storms would look like.  As financial institution supervisors and as leaders of financial institutions, we all knew we needed to be better prepared for crisis events, whatever their character, source or timing.  Since I made those remarks, a number of stress events have reinforced not only the need for continued substantive changes in firms, but also the benefits of the changes we have made so far. \n\n1. Starting first with what has been accomplished to make financial firms\u2014and the system\u2014more resilient today to future shocks. \n\nFirst, in the area of capital resiliency, as a result of both new bank capital standards and our new stress testing regime, bank capital levels and the quality of capital have increased significantly\u2014and on some measures, nearly doubled from pre-crisis levels.  The banking system has more capital and, thus, a better ability to withstand stressful events when they arise.  At the same time, our supervisory focus on capital planning and management across firms has led to greater focus and attention on the internal processes that firms use to manage their capital, including the prudent distribution of capital to shareholders, whether through dividends or share buybacks. \n\nIn the area of liquidity, again, new rules and regulations have raised both the absolute level of liquidity in firms and the quality of liquid assets (that is, assets that are readily accessible). This provides for a much stronger ability to manage through stress conditions.  As many firms learned in the depths of the crisis, what was once thought to be a liquid asset quickly became illiquid as markets seized up and normal outlets for converting assets to cash evaporated.  Further, our enhanced focus today on liquidity management across the range of firms we supervise has led to heightened management\u2014and board of directors\u2014attention to liquidity levels, liquidity risk management and liquidity stress testing. \n\nIn addition, global supervisors have finalized rules\u2014or are in the process of finalizing rules\u2014in the areas of both capital and liquidity, including additional and more stringent rules for the largest, most systemically important firms.  For these firms, additional buffers will be required, as will stronger risk management practices.   \n\n2. In addition to becoming more resilient, firms have made some progress in becoming less complex\u2014although the progress is somewhat less measurable and less dramatic to date.\n\nFirms have begun to take a hard look at their legal entity structures, including having identified and mapped material legal entities. This was a necessary first step for a lot of firms, which have begun the difficult task of making sense of their legal entity structures. This will be a focus of our future supervisory work on firms' preparedness for recovery and resolution planning.\n\nAnother positive step was recently made in the area of financial contracts\u2014wherein 18 global firms recently agreed to sign a new ISDA Resolution Stay Protocol.  The Protocol will provide for a stay of certain early termination rights triggered by resolution proceedings.  The stay is intended to give jurisdictions time to orchestrate an orderly resolution of a troubled institution.  It will be important that firms adhere to the protocol and amend ISDA Master Agreements consistent with the terms of the protocol.  Firms should carry out a similar effort with respect to other types of financial contracts not covered through the protocol.\n\nWhile these are positive steps, the feedback provided to the industry this summer after our review of the 2013 resolution plans for the largest firms suggested that quite a bit of work remains ahead on rationalizing legal entity structures, as well as in other areas, particularly:\n\n3. In the third area of our Framework\u2014better managed \u2014we have seen progress on several fronts, although this area remains very much a work in progress.\n\nConsidering that a firm's leadership, including the board of directors and the senior management, is ultimately responsible for the culture of the firm, and culture is a dynamic element that firms should always strive to improve, I see the work in the area of better managed as requiring on-going, sustained attention.  It is impossible to achieve \"perfection\" in an area of art like management.  I think it's also important to acknowledge that cultures within individual firms ultimately play a role in defining the culture of the industry.  We have seen progress in this area over the past few years with some firms hiring outside experts, engaging in cultural diagnostic work and implementing programs that focus on improving ethics, behaviors and internal culture. \n\nWe've also seen progress in our direct engagement with boards of directors\u2014and we've seen this across institutions of all sizes.  When we, as supervisors, first began requiring deeper engagement with directors and senior leaders, the reactions varied, with an initial wariness of the purpose.  In fact, directors were often accompanied by a compliance or regulatory relations liaison during our early interactions with them.  Over time, though, as senior leaders and board members recognized the advantages of this level of engagement, the process has been smoother and our exchanges are becoming more engaging and direct (and few if any \"escorts\" are present during our interactions now).  While the level of engagement varies across firms, in general, we are seeing boards being more active in asking questions, providing oversight of management and engaging with supervisors.  We, in turn, have deeper insight into decision making dynamics at the board and c-suite level, including the how and why of decision making on key strategic issues.  Regular communications also encourage early and proactive surfacing of issues.\n\nIn addition, we've seen good progress in recruiting additional directors to complement current skills on the board\u2014better positioning the board to engage with the senior management team in a productive and appropriately challenging way. \n\nBefore turning to the road ahead, I wanted to pause and recognize two things.  First, it's clear that progress has been made across the industry in a number of areas\u2014particularly in making firms and the system more resilient through improvements in capital and liquidity, as well as enhancements in risk management, including capital planning and stress testing across the range of risks firms face.  But, in the remaining two areas of the Framework\u2013 less complex and better managed\u2014I think it's safe to say that despite the fact that firms are addressing a number of outstanding issues, these areas continue to present challenges in reaching the desired end state.\n\nAs I'm sure you would agree, we collectively still have quite a bit of work to do to fully implement the changes required under new rules and regulations.  While it is important to take stock of the changes made over the past few years\u2014first, to assess the impact of those changes, both intended an unintended; and, second, to understand the contours of the \"new\" financial system operating under a plethora of new rules and regulations, both national and global in nature\u2014we must acknowledge that some of the changes necessary have yet to be fully implemented.  We must continue to devote sufficient attention and resources to complete the efforts.  And, firms and supervisors will continue to face challenges and competing demands as we press ahead on reform efforts in the coming months and years. \n\nThe Road Ahead\nLooking ahead, we see a number of challenges that firms are facing, and I thought I'd take a couple of minutes to share with you some broad themes that we see emerging.  The list is not exhaustive or overly detailed\u2014as I'm sure you will recognize\u2014but I think it captures some of the issues that are\u2014and should be\u2014more \"top-of-mind\" for many of you.     \n\n1. Engagement of Boards and Senior Management:  While management is clearly on the hook to develop and implement necessary changes, and despite the tremendous progress made in board engagement over the past few years, some firms are still struggling to set the appropriate level of engagement with their boards. The challenge for these firms is finding the right balance and having a clearer understanding of the roles and responsibilities of boards of directors.\n\nBased on our experiences with increased engagement with boards, a number of lessons can be applied to engagement between senior management and boards, including the importance of:  \n\nFirms should not underestimate the importance of the chairman or lead director, or the roles of the committee chairs.  The board has the responsibilities to provide the appropriate level of oversight and to be prepared to hold senior management accountable for their running of the firm.  You don't want board members so involved that they need to approve every policy and procedure.  You do want them to be involved enough that they understand the organization, they are providing the right level of oversight and guidance, and they share a sense of responsibility for the actions of the firm.\n\n2. Resources:  In terms of talent, we see firms struggling to recruit and retain sufficient expertise in some areas, with firms competing for the talent needed to implement new standards and to address identified resource gaps.  We also understand the challenges firms are having with filling many difficult leadership roles, such as risk management and compliance positions, where demand is higher than the supply of talented candidates.\n\nWith regard to general population of eligible candidates, hiring managers must be willing to look closer at the 25 to 40-year-old cohort that makes up much of the workforce in the industry.  There needs to be a better understanding of:  1) what incents and motivates them; and 2) why they fail to make long-term commitments to firms.  The high turnover rates in financial services can be attributed in part to the competitive nature of the industry, the financial incentives to move, and the lack of repercussions for bad behavior.  But, more importantly, the demographics of the workforce may also playing an important role.  According to a report from the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median tenure of workers ages 25 to 34 is only three years\u2014less than a third of the tenure among people aged 55 to 64 years old.1  And, according a Future Workplace \"Multiple Generations@Work\" survey, 91 percent of \"millennials\" (that is, a person born between 1977 and 1997) expect to stay in a job for less than three years.\n\nJob-hopping can speed career advancement.  Getting a promotion in the process of changing jobs allows employees to avoid the \"dues paying\" that can keep workers in a painfully slow rise up the corporate ladder.  Job hopping can also lead to greater job fulfillment.  A 2012 survey by Net Impact2 found that 88 percent of all workers considered \"positive culture\" important or essential to their dream job, and 86 percent said the same for work they found \"interesting.\" The same survey found that millennials are the least satisfied in their careers.\n\nI also recognize that firms are no longer just competing with others in the financial sector for talent.  With skills that can be adapted across multiple industries, the talent pool that was once specialized for financial firms is now spread thin. This puts pressure on the firms and gives talented workers the advantage of being selective in their roles.  They demand more from hiring managers and sense other opportunities out there if they're not satisfied.\n\nAs I said to a group of foreign firms a few weeks ago, all firms, regardless of size, need to keep this information in mind and get better at planning in advance, ensuring their recruiting efforts are providing a steady stream of qualified candidates, and looking for opportunities to move people around within the organization, particularly between the front office and control functions, to develop more well-rounded professionals.  This is likely to mean more aggressive, creative and targeted searches and a commitment to ongoing training.  As the competitive landscape and regulatory requirements change, firms will need to find the right balance between hiring new talent with specific expertise and training current staff to keep them up to speed and capitalize on institutional knowledge.\n\n3. Continuing to Build Resilience\u2014Stress Testing and Risk Management:  No, I am not suggesting that all firms, regardless of size, are going to be required to participate in CCAR.  However, I believe that incorporating the motivating principles behind stress testing into your planning\u2014namely thinking about the many ways that tomorrow could be different from today and what that could mean for your business\u2014is at the heart of managing your risk and your business with foresight and prudence.  Sound risk management demands a thorough understanding of the organization's full risk profile today and how it could evolve tomorrow.  We expect banking organizations of all types and sizes to have the capacity to analyze the potential impact of adverse outcomes on their financial condition. \n\nStress testing can be a means to carry out such analysis. Certain portions of existing supervisory guidance\u2014which cover capital planning and management of funding and liquidity risks\u2014discuss using stress testing or addressing potential adverse outcomes in order to enhance risk management practices. This guidance is applied commensurate with an organization's size, complexity and risk profile. For example:\n\n4. Structure and Culture:  The final area, or challenge, I wanted to touch on is organizational structure and culture.  Firms need to ensure that business strategy, organizational structure and desired culture are aligned to successfully operate in a fast-paced, ever-changing world.  Whether you are a small community bank or a large global institution, you need to be agile enough to act quickly without risking the integrity of your structure and culture.\n\nI will touch on culture again a little later.\n\nIn the short term, these are issues that we see as \"top-of-mind\" in terms of challenges and should continue to be areas of focus for firms.  I thought I would close out today with thoughts on two areas.  At times I have described these as being on my list of \"things that keep me awake at night,\" and I think it's fair to say that these two issues continue to be near the top of that list.  They are: information technology and culture.   \n\nWhat Keeps Me Awake at Night\n\n1. Information Technology\n\nMy first issue is a topic that I had the opportunity to address with many of you earlier this year: the broad area of information technology, which has a few dimensions to it. \n\nThe first dimension won't surprise you or your boards: cybersecurity.  I'm sure I don't have to explain too much why this keeps me awake at night.  Suffice it to say that as I think about the kinds of risks that might cause the next crisis, cybersecurity is the one that worries me the most. \n\nThe worry is not focused solely on the financial sector.  This is much bigger than just banks.  It includes many other sectors, most notably, the retail sector.  In particular, cyber threats pose a potentially systemic risk to financial stability through the disruption or corruption of critical payment, clearing and settlement systems and related data.  A big question we need to think about is how firms, big and small, can protect themselves from these risks.\n\nAs I have noted in the past, all of us face quite a bit of work ahead on the cybersecurity front.  Importantly for us, as supervisors, we must determine the best areas of focus given our perspective and the range of skills that we can bring to the topic.  For example, in the near-term we are continuing supervisory plans related to cyber security work at the complex financial institutions.  We are also identifying \"core\" expectations for smaller firms so that they, too, can take appropriate measures to harden their defenses. \n\nWe are also undertaking concentrated work to: develop a better understanding of vulnerabilities and emerging practices: develop an approach to enhanced communications around cyber events, and revisit supervisory guidance in this area.  The initial work will require a deeper assessment of the interconnectedness of firms and the prioritization of critical operations.  We will be working with all of you to do that.  Once we all have a better understanding of the areas of risk, we all need to focus on timely and centralized communications across all firms.  Finally, while there is a lot of guidance in this area, we recognize that we need to review our supervisory approach and our tools to ensure we are in the best position to understand and assess vulnerabilities.  This step is critical so that we can make timely and informed decisions that enhance the effectiveness of our supervisory framework for cybersecurity.\n\nI think we've done a reasonable job in developing rules and regulations to ensure firms are prepared to withstand the other types of shocks we have experienced in the past.  But, cyber adds an element to planning for the next crisis that goes beyond what additional capital and liquidity, for example, can provide to the system. \n\nThe topic is a daunting one, but one that we have to address in the very near-term.  It is an area that will continue to warrant attention and will require a level of coordination and collaboration between the public and private sectors.  In many respects, I think we are all in this one together.\n\nThe second dimension is legacy:  There is still so much \"clean-up\" to do to fix longstanding technology and data issues that have built up over the years.  The investments necessary are long-term and the fixes, in many cases, will take multiple years to execute.  A number of firms have sound programs in place to address these longstanding issues, but continued strong project management and tenacity are crucial.  I see commitment to this basic \"blocking and tackling\" as essential to financial institutions continuing to be competitive\u2014and relevant\u2014in the digital world. \n\nAnd that's the third dimension that concerns me:  the competitive landscape for financial institutions in the digital world.  As more and more non-financial entities are entering the financial arena, I worry that financial firms may lack the agility and ability to compete at the level that they need to\u2014particularly with the added complexities (and likely constraints) of regulation.  At the end of the day, will financial firms be able to compete in the same way\u2014or will these largely unregulated players be the future of our financial system? \n\n2. Culture\n\nMy final topic today is culture\u2014a complex topic that we all know it is an important one.  Before I get into this in detail, I want to stress that \"culture\" is very different from \"risk culture.\"  You can have a strong risk culture within your firm, but still have cultural issues.  The culture I am talking about today is broader and deeper.\n\nThere seems to be a general acceptance that there needs to be changes to the overall culture in the financial services industry, as well as improvements to cultures within individual firms.  However there continues to be a lot of mixed views around how the changes can and should be initiated and implemented.  The interconnectedness of the industry has resulted in the public viewing the industry as \"one.\"  Therefore, I believe to address the tarnished reputation of the industry as a whole in a credible and sustainable way, firms must be willing to address it with a unified front. \n\nCulture is a bit of a nebulous concept that tends to go unattended.  Accepting that cultural change is a necessity, not a \"nice to do,\" is the first step in a long road that will require the participation of management, boards and every employee on your payroll.\n\nThe culture within the organization will guide the behavior of employees, particularly when there are shades of gray.  Therefore, if organizational values and norms conflict with the rules or guidance you are required to follow, the organization is headed for trouble.  The failure to understand the purpose of a law or regulation may lead one to adopt an overly technical or game-like approach to compliance.  Left uncorrected, this type of compliance arbitrage can fester and lead to micro-cultures lacking in respect for law.  The recent enforcement actions addressing sanctions violations offer prime examples of this unfortunate and costly phenomenon.\n\nLast week we hosted a workshop on \"Reforming Culture and Behavior in the Financial Services Industry\" at our offices downtown.  Based on the discussions among panelists and attendees, it was evident that industry participants have taken onboard the directive that cultural and behavioral change is needed in the industry.  A number of firms have begun to implement programs that are at various stages of depth, breadth and maturity.  There were a few key themes that emerged that I want to share with you today:\n\nSo, as we move forward and the industry ramps up its efforts to address this issue, I see a number of considerations that must be incorporated into the solutions. They are in three main categories: management, operations and employees.\n\nRegarding management, we need leadership from top.  Firms must have a clearly articulated statement of purpose that aligns with the firm's business strategy and risk appetite.  The business model must be simple enough that it can be shared with employees and understood at every level.  Senior managers must lead by example, present a unified front and set the tone.  The job of the leader is to encourage and foster the good and squash the bad.  While many argue that it takes just \"one bad apple,\" firms must accept that it is rarely just one and that they always need to be focused on identifying the potential problems and addressing them early and quickly before they become outsized.\n\nBoards, whether as a whole or through a sub-committee, need to set direction and expectations on culture and behavior, and measure and monitor progress over time.  Boards also need to hold senior management accountable for building and sustaining the appropriate culture and fostering the desired behaviors over time.  Senior management must in turn hold employees accountable for their actions. \n\nWithin the category of operations, I envision the development of industry standards on culture and behavior, enhanced communications, both within firms and across the industry, and clarification around success metrics.  It's important to realize that \"one size does not fit all\" when it comes to solutions and metrics.  Employees should know what behaviors are expected from them and how their actions will be measured.  The purpose, strategy and business plan need to be communicated to every level of the organization.  It should be clear to employees how their work aligns with the purpose and strategy and how they contribute to the overall success of the firm.\n\nFinally, within the employee category, the remedies need to cover the entire employment cycle, from recruitment and onboarding to performance management, compensation and promotion.  I have already spoken about the importance of hiring practices, so I don't need to repeat myself here.  It goes without saying that to be successful in strengthening hiring practices, you need to incorporate a process where you assess whether candidates are a strong fit with the desired culture of the organization and develop indoctrination programs whereby new employees are educated on strategy and vision, as well as the behaviors that are not tolerated.  The goal is to convince all employees of three points.  First, good behavior protects them as well as the firm.  Second, all employees share the consequences of poor conduct.  Third, it is therefore the responsibility of each employee root out bad behavior.\n\nThe industry also needs to consider a mechanism to stop movement of \"bad apples\" from firm to firm.  The current situation not only facilitates movement, but in many cases rewards it.  By allowing employees to jump from firm to firm, the impact of unethical behavior is systemic and cannot be contained within one firm or a small section of the industry.  We must address this challenge.\n\nOnce employees are on board, performance management should play a greater role, both in compensation decision-making, which needs to be simplified and diversified, and in the promotion process. The process should reflect a better balance between production and controls, by focusing not on \"what\" was accomplished but \"how\" it was accomplished.  Repercussions are necessary for employees that do not behave in a manner that is desirable.\n\nI said that leadership must come from the top.  But that doesn't mean that you can't drive the culture from throughout the organization in the form of \"culture carriers\"\u2014employees who are well connected, respected and can be effective in making your culture \"go viral.\"\n\nCultural change is not just a \"flavor of the month.\"  It is a long-term commitment to changing a firm and an industry.  It will take time.  And, once you feel you've achieved what you originally set out to achieve, you will likely have raised the bar and will need to reset your goals.  Building and maintaining a strong culture in a firm is an ongoing effort, not a \"one and done\" initiative. \n\nConclusion\nWill our list of \"to dos\" ever end?  Probably not.  Will our list of \"worries\" get shorter?  Unlikely in the current environment. \n\nWe live in an ever-changing environment where speed and agility are of the essence.  Demands from customers change, expectations from shareholders change, and the regulatory landscape you work within will continue to evolve to keep pace.  Constant change\u2014and commitment to evolution\u2014is not a choice.  It is a necessity to remain relevant and provide a safe, sound and accessible financial sector that also contributes to the health, vitality and dynamic growth of our economy.\n\nOverall, we want smooth, efficient markets that support global growth.  We want to continue to reduce the systemic risk posed by firms that are large, complex and interconnected.  We want to ensure fair access to credit for all.  And we want a strong, resilient, safe financial system.  Our challenge is how to balance all of these \"wants.\"  As we strive to find the balance, it is important that we continue to have productive engagements with you, the industry.  We need honest, frank and educated discussions.  And we need to work together to gain a better understanding of our shared goals and how to get there. \n\n1 Employee Tenure in 2014\n\n2 Talent Report: What Workers Want in 2012"

    "content": "As I noted earlier at the start of today\u2019s workshop, improving culture in the financial services industry is an imperative.  This endeavor is important in order to ensure financial stability over time, but also to ensure the public trust in our financial system.  In my remarks today, I will first talk about what I see as the culture problem.  Then, I will focus on how incentives could be improved within the financial services industry to encourage better culture and behavior.  This includes how we compensate employees of a financial institution, but it also extends to how these firms identify wrong-doers and punish them.  As always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nThe Existing Culture Problem\n\nIn recent years, there have been ongoing occurrences of serious professional misbehavior, ethical lapses and compliance failures at financial institutions.  This has resulted in a long list of large fines and penalties, and, to a lesser degree than I would have desired employee dismissals and punishment.  Since 2008, fines imposed on the nation\u2019s largest banks have far exceeded $100 billion.2  The pattern of bad behavior did not end with the financial crisis, but continued despite the considerable public sector intervention that was necessary to stabilize the financial system.  As a consequence, the financial industry has largely lost the public trust.  To illustrate, a 2012 Harris poll found that 42 percent of people responded either \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201ca lot\u201d to the statement that Wall Street \u201charms the country\u201d; furthermore, 68 percent disagreed with the statement: \u201cIn general, people on Wall Street are as honest and moral as other people.\u201d \n\nI reject the narrative that the current state of affairs is simply the result of the actions of isolated rogue traders or a few bad actors within these firms.  As James O\u2019Toole and Warren Bennis observed in their Harvard Business Review article about corporate culture: \u201cEthical problems in organizations originate not with \u2018a few bad apples\u2019 but with the \u2018barrel makers\u2019.\u201d3  That is, the problems originate from the culture of the firms, and this culture is largely shaped by the firms\u2019 leadership.  This means that the solution needs to originate from within the firms, from their leaders.\n\nWhat do I mean by the culture within a firm? Culture relates to the implicit norms that guide behavior in the absence of regulations or compliance rules\u2014and sometimes despite those explicit restraints.  Culture exists within every firm whether it is recognized or ignored, whether it is nurtured or neglected, and whether it is embraced or disavowed.  Culture reflects the prevailing attitudes and behaviors within a firm.  It is how people react not only to black and white, but to all of the shades of grey.  Like a gentle breeze, culture may be hard to see, but you can feel it.  Culture relates to what \u201cshould\u201d I do, and not to what \u201ccan\u201d I do. \n\nA number of factors have contributed to the cultural failures that we have seen.  An important question is whether the sheer size, complexity and global scope of large financial firms today have left them \u201ctoo big to manage.\u201d  Large problems can originate in small corners of these firms, as illustrated by the Financial Products Group experience at AIG, and the \u201cLondon Whale\u201d episode at JPMorgan.  Differences in attitudes and business practices across countries can also be difficult to reconcile within a firm\u2019s overall compliance function.  Recent fines against BNP Paribas for violating U.S. sanctions programs and providing dollar funding to a country engaged in genocide and against Credit Suisse for facilitating tax evasion by U.S. citizens, point to these challenges.  Another important element affecting culture has been the shift in the prevailing business model away from traditional commercial and investment banking activities to trading; that is, from client-oriented to transaction-oriented activities.  Clients became counterparties\u2014the other side of a trade\u2014rather than partners in a long-term business relationship.  In general, interactions became more depersonalized, making it easier to rationalize away bad behavior, and more difficult to identify who would be harmed by any unethical actions.\n\nHigh-powered pay incentives linked to short-term profits, combined with a flexible and fluid job market, have also contributed to a lessening of firm loyalty\u2014and, sometimes, to a disregard for the law\u2014in an effort to generate larger bonuses.  Often allegiance to an external network of traders has been more important than the ties the trader has to his or her particular employer.  This is particularly evident in the illegal manipulations of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), and with respect to reference rates in the foreign exchange markets.\n\nAlthough cultural and ethical problems are not unique to the finance industry, financial firms are different from other firms in important ways. First, the financial sector plays a key public role in allocating scarce capital and exerting market discipline throughout a complex, global economy.  For the economy to achieve its long-term growth potential, we need a sound and vibrant financial sector.  Financial firms exist, in part, to benefit the public, not simply their shareholders, employees and corporate clients.  Unless the financial industry can rebuild the public trust, it cannot effectively perform its essential functions.  For this reason alone, the industry must do much better.\n\nAs was discussed earlier, in the U.K., seven of its largest banking institutions have recently founded the Banking Standards Review Council under the leadership of Sir Richard Lambert, who joined us today.  I would strongly encourage the largest institutions based here in the United States to work to develop collaborative solutions aimed at improving culture and rebuilding the public trust.\n\nThe Key Role for Senior Leadership\n\nCorrecting this problem must start with senior leadership of the firm.  The \u201ctone at the top\u201d and the example that senior leaders set is critical to an institution\u2019s culture\u2014it largely determines the \u201cquality of the barrel.\u201d  As a first step, senior leaders need to hold up a mirror to their own behavior and critically examine behavioral norms at their firm.  Sustainable change at any firm will take time.  Turning around a firm\u2019s culture is a marathon not a sprint.  Senior leaders must take responsibility for the solution and communicate frequently, credibly and consistently about the importance of culture.  Boards of directors have a critical role to play in setting the tone and holding senior leaders accountable for delivering sustainable change.  A healthy culture must be carefully nurtured for it to have any chance of becoming self-sustaining.\n\nFirms must take a comprehensive approach to improving their culture that encompasses recruitment, onboarding, career development, performance reviews, pay and promotion.  All of these elements need to be aligned with the desired culture.  Through our supervisory process, we have seen that a number of firms have started this process by developing or refining employee surveys and 360 feedback processes to target issues of behavior and culture.  Some firms are incorporating case study discussions into training programs to highlight ethical dilemmas and decision-making.  Some are revamping senior level promotion criteria to reinforce what are the desired characteristics and behaviors of leaders.  These efforts are at various stages in terms of their depth, breadth and maturity.  Supervisors will need to see how these frameworks evolve, and more importantly, see evidence of how these efforts yield results in the form of more open and routine escalation of issues, consistent application of \u201cshould we\u201d versus \u201ccould we\u201d in business decisions, rigor in identifying and controlling of conduct risk, and how compliance breaches factor into compensation.\n\nMeasurement and accountability for progress in developing a healthier culture across the industry is paramount to us as supervisors and central bankers.  An important measurement of progress is employees\u2019 assessment of their firm\u2019s culture.  To this end, we encourage the industry to harness the various individual efforts that have been initiated at a number of firms in order to develop a comprehensive culture survey.  This anonymous survey would be fielded across firms each year by an independent third-party and the results shared with supervisors.  Having a common survey instrument would promote benchmarking of, and accountability for, progress on culture and behavior. \n\nA core element of any firm\u2019s mission and culture must be a respect for law.  Federal Reserve guidance advises that banks should strive to \u201c[m]aintain a corporate culture that emphasizes the importance of compliance with laws and regulations and consumer protection.\u201d4   To maintain such a culture, senior leaders must promote effective self-policing.  If audit uncovers an instance of fraud in one unit, the firm\u2019s leadership should ask, \u201cWhere else could this behavior occur?\u201d  If the press reports fraud at a competitor in a particular business line, the same self-assessment should apply.  \u201cCould this happen to us, could we have a similar problem here?\u201d  When fraud is detected, boards and senior leaders must ensure that they are informed promptly, and that a thorough inquiry is undertaken at once.  The senior leaders of financial firms, and those who report to them, must also be proactive in reporting illegal or unethical activity.  Early self-reporting sends a powerful message to employees and to regulators about a firm\u2019s respect for law.  This is one important reason why those who self-report in a timely way should be treated preferentially, compared to those that drag their feet and whose bad behaviors are only uncovered by enforcement investigations.\n\nHow will a firm know if it is making real progress?  Not having to plead guilty to felony charges or being assessed large fines is a good start.  Firms should also pay closer attention to how they and the industry are broadly viewed by the public.  Internally, one important marker for progress is the frequency of problems, and whether small problems stay small, or instead, grow into large problems.  A healthy culture is one where problems are identified early and promptly addressed.\n\nIn addition to a strong compliance function, firms need to foster an environment that rewards the free exchange of ideas and views.  Individuals should feel that they can raise a concern, and have confidence that the issues will be escalated and fully considered.  This is a critical element to prevention.  A firm\u2019s employees are its best monitors, but this only works well if they feel a shared responsibility to speak up, expect to be heard and their efforts supported by senior management.\n\nLet me give you an example to take this from the abstract to the more specific.  As I noted in a speech a few weeks ago on the issue of reference rate reform, in the case of the LIBOR setting process, the information barriers between the traders and LIBOR submitters were paper thin and porous.5  At times, traders and LIBOR submitters colluded to manipulate LIBOR for the gain of the traders and the firm. \n\nWhat should have happened instead goes like this:  A trader asks the LIBOR submitter to adjust the submitted rate.  The submitter says \u201cno way,\u201d tells the trader that this request is inappropriate and that the trader will be reported to compliance.  The submitter reports the trader\u2019s attempt at manipulation to legal and compliance.  Compliance investigates to confirm the facts.  The trader is fired and is fully prosecuted for any criminal actions.  For this all to happen, a firm doesn\u2019t just have to have the right rules and procedures in place, but it also needs the right culture to ensure that those rules and procedures are followed, that the bad behavior sees the light of day immediately and that the transgressors are punished in a way that is known broadly throughout the firm\u2014that is, a clear example of the consequences is demonstrated to others.\n\nHow Can Better Incentives Help?\n\nIn my example, for matters to work properly, I think it is important that all the players\u2014traders, compliance, risk and legal, have the right incentives to behave in the way that is appropriate and that aligns their interests with the broader interests of the firm in rooting out bad behaviors.  One way in which incentives can be shaped is through the structure of compensation.  I believe that a proper compensation system can be an important tool for enhancing culture, promoting financial stability and rebuilding the public trust in the financial industry.\n\nIncentives matter for individual behaviors and decisions in all industries, including the financial industry.  Some might argue, however, that risk-takers are drawn to finance like they are drawn to Formula One racing, and that regardless of risk or reward, these types of individuals will always want to push the boundaries.  This logic might lead one to conclude that incentives are unlikely to be an effective tool to limit excessive risk-taking and to promote more ethical behavior in the financial sector.  I disagree.  First, the degree to which an industry attracts risk-takers is not pre-ordained, but reflects the prevailing incentives in the industry.  After all, risk-takers have options.  Second, and, more importantly, incentives matter even for risk-takers.\n\nIn my speech on ending too big to fail, I stressed the importance of reducing the likelihood that large financial firms would face insolvency, as well as the need for a credible resolution plan that does not involve taxpayer money.  Compensation policies can play a useful role in reducing excessive risk-taking.  Similarly, compensation policies can complement an improved culture, and play a role in reducing unethical and fraudulent behavior.  Individuals who decide to bend the rules or to step over the line usually do this in the context of an assessment of the expected risks and rewards of their actions.\n\nThis implies that one objective should be to rebalance the scales so that the expected risks from unwanted behaviors are more likely to outweigh the expected rewards.  The expected risks are a function of the likelihood that an individual (or set of individuals) is caught and the attendant consequences.  The expected rewards include any financial and psychic benefits to the individual from the behavior if undetected.  Improved culture helps to tip the balance in the favor of better behaviors by increasing the likelihood that an individual will both feel an obligation to behave properly, and be prevented by others from carrying out bad behavior.  In addition, a strong culture can also reduce the rewards some employees may hope to enjoy.  In its simplest form, a strong culture means that individuals who get away with unethical or illegal activities will not have the satisfaction of \u201cbragging rights\u201d about their actions because there are no congratulations for breaking the law or outwitting compliance.  A strong culture will reinforce the simple reward of having done the right thing. A clear conscience can be a powerful reward.\n\nA well-designed compensation structure can also help favorably tip the balance by effectively extending the time horizon of senior management and material risk-takers, and by forcing them to more fully internalize the consequences of their actions.  There are two important dimensions of the structure of compensation\u2014first, how much compensation is paid out immediately versus deferred into the future, and second, the form of the compensation that is deferred\u2014cash, equity, equity options or debt.  For deferred compensation, the rules for how it vests and under what conditions it can be forfeited are important.  Getting the balance right is critical.  For my part, I believe that in order to improve financial stability and rebuild the public trust, more compensation in finance needs to be deferred and for longer periods.  Also, I think there needs to be a shift in the mix of deferred compensation away from equity and towards debt.\n\nThe optimal structure of deferred compensation likely differs with respect to the goals of providing incentives to support prudent risk-taking versus encouraging the right culture.  For example, consider trades that might appear to be highly profitable on a mark-to-market basis, but take some time to be closed out and for the profits to be realized in fact, not just on paper.  In this case, as long as deferred compensation is set at a horizon longer than the life of the trade, this can ensure the firm\u2019s and the trader\u2019s incentives are aligned and the \u201ctrader\u2019s option\u201d is effectively mitigated.  This component of deferred compensation could take the form of either cash or equity.\n\nHowever, in contrast to the issue of trading risk, unethical and illegal behavior may take a much longer period of time\u2014measured in many years\u2014to surface and to be fully resolved.  For this reason, I believe that it is also important to have a component of deferred compensation that does not begin to vest for several years.  For example, the deferral period might be five years, with uniform vesting over an additional five years.  Given recent experience, a decade would seem to be a reasonable timeframe to provide sufficient time and space for any illegal actions or violations of the firm\u2019s culture to materialize and fines and legal penalties realized.  As I will argue below, I also believe that this longer vesting portion of the deferred compensation should be debt as opposed to equity.6\n\nI noted earlier that improving a financial firm\u2019s culture will take sustained determination and commitment from its senior leaders.  Deferred compensation can play a useful role in reinforcing buy-in of senior leadership to this endeavor.  As I discussed last November, an important element of a Title II resolution under Dodd-Frank is that there is sufficient long-term unsecured debt at the holding company level to recapitalize a failing bank.  I indicated in my remarks that it would be useful if a meaningful component of this debt was contributed by the senior management and the firm\u2019s material risk-takers.  That is, if a bank ran into solvency problems, this component of deferred compensation would be used to recapitalize the restructured bank.  The goal is to incent senior management and the material risk-takers to focus on maximizing the long-term \u201centerprise\u201d value of the firm, not just the short-term share price.  In this framework, I would expect the relative size of the debt component of deferred compensation to increase as one moved up the management ranks to the senior managers of the firm.  That is, the individuals who have the greatest impact on a firm\u2019s strategic direction should have the strongest incentives to maximize the firm\u2019s long-term enterprise value.\n\nIf we have this deferred compensation structure in place for financial firms, then we can leverage it to strengthen the incentives for senior leaders to design and implement the necessary changes to improve their firm\u2019s culture.  That is, this deferred debt compensation can be used as a \u201cperformance bond.\u201d  Performance bonds are used in many situations such as security deposits on rental properties.  Today, when a financial firm is assessed a large fine it is paid by the shareholders of the firm.  Although senior management may own equity in the firm, their combined ownership share is likely small, and so management bears only a small fraction of the fine.  Now, having shareholders pay may create market discipline in that they have an incentive to better monitor the firm\u2019s actions.  However, financial firms are not transparent enterprises, and it would be difficult even for a diligent shareholder to be able to know when these bad behaviors are taking place, much less to be able to take actions to prevent them.  This limits the potential effectiveness of market discipline exerted by shareholders.\n\nHow can we improve on this situation? Assume instead that a sizeable portion of the fine is now paid for out of the firm\u2019s deferred debt compensation, with only the remaining balance paid for by shareholders.  In other words, in the case of a large fine, the senior management and the material risk-takers would forfeit their performance bond.  This would increase the financial incentive of those individuals who are best placed to identify bad activities at an early stage, or prevent them from occurring in the first place.  In addition, if paying the fine were to deplete the pool of deferred debt below a minimum required level, the solution could be to reduce the ratio of current to deferred pay until the minimum deferred compensation debt requirement is again satisfied\u2014that is, until a new performance bond is posted.\n\nNot only would this deferred debt compensation discipline individual behavior and decision-making, but it would provide strong incentives for individuals to flag issues when problems develop.  Each individual\u2019s ability to realize their deferred debt compensation would depend not only on their own behavior, but also on the behavior of their colleagues.  This would create a strong incentive for individuals to monitor the actions of their colleagues, and to call attention to any issues.  This could be expected to help to keep small problems from growing into larger ones.  Importantly, individuals would not be able to \u201copt out\u201d of the firm as a way of escaping the problem.  If a person knew that something is amiss and decided to leave the firm, their deferred debt compensation would still be at risk.  This would reinforce the incentive for the individual to stay at the firm and to try to get the problem fixed.\n\nThis might work for senior managers, but what about those material risk-takers who are early in their careers at a firm and do not have much wealth tied up through deferred compensation to serve as an effective performance bond?  How do we provide strong incentives for these traders not to put the firm at risk by their potential illegal behavior?  In these cases, we can create the performance bond in a slightly different manner.  Individuals who enter finance have generally invested heavily to develop the specialized skills required in the field.  These skills typically have a higher return in finance than they do in any other occupation.  That is, workers in finance earn a premium relative to their next best alternative job outside of the industry.  Over the course of a career, this premium can be expected to add up to a significant sum of money.  This cumulative premium can act like a performance bond.  For this to be the case, however, an individual who is convicted of illegal activities, or who violates a firm\u2019s code of conduct would need to face the risk of being permanently denied employment in the financial industry.  Rather than paying for the performance bond upfront, the bond is posted in terms of the privilege to continue to work in the industry.\n\nThere are several steps that can be taken to implement this concept.  The first step is to make it more difficult for employees in finance who cross ethical boundaries to be able to move from one firm to another in order to escape the consequences.  Currently, lenders who are considering making a loan to a borrower can look up the borrower\u2019s credit score which reflects the borrower\u2019s performance on past loans.  In a similar manner, it would be helpful if financial firms, prior to making a hiring decision, could look up a candidate\u2019s \u201cethics and compliance score\u201d that reflects the individual\u2019s past performance at other financial firms.\n\nAlong these lines, one approach would be to create a central registry that tracks the hiring and firing of traders and other financial professionals across the industry.  There would be many details to sort out regarding how to do this in a manner that was both transparent and consistent with due process.  The database could be maintained by the official sector\u2014specifically, by financial institution supervisors\u2014based on information provided by supervised financial institutions.  A similar regime already exists in the broker-dealer context, in which supervised institutions are required to file U4 and U5 forms when they hire and part ways with licensed professionals.  Banking supervisors could consider whether it was appropriate to import these concepts to the banking industry.  To help support the completeness and accuracy of the filings, the filing firms could be subject to a safe harbor, akin to the civil immunity for filing a Suspicious Activity Report, so that employers do not fear liability for good faith reporting.  Under this approach, new regulations could also require that all financial institutions search the database prior to hiring any trader or financial professional; so that any prior reported events could be taken into account in the course of a hiring decision.  As I mentioned, there would, of course, need to be adequate safeguards for employees to challenge an entry, consistent with due process.\n\nFurthermore, as a complementary step to the registry, it would be helpful if individuals in finance who are convicted of an illegal activity were prohibited from future employment in the financial services industry.  Currently, Section 19 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act prohibits anyone convicted of a crime of dishonesty, breach of trust, or money laundering from working at an insured depository institution or bank holding company.7  One possibility could be to amend Section 19 to cover the entire financial services industry.  The precise formulation of an amendment would need to be worked out, but the application should be sufficiently broad so that it also covers asset managers, hedge funds and private equity funds.  Like the registry, a broad and permanent industry prohibition changes the time horizon for the perceived costs of misconduct\u2014from a one-time fine, or perhaps a few years in prison, to a lifetime prohibition from earning a living in finance, regardless of the type of employer involved.  I would welcome the industry\u2019s participation in developing this concept.\n\nConclusion   \n\nTo ensure the behavior that is required for a safe, sound and trusted financial system, we must also be effective in our role as regulators and supervisors.  As part of this, we as supervisors must continually work to improve our own cultures to ensure that we can successively carry out our responsibilities.  But it also requires good culture at the institutions that we supervise.  Supervisors simply do not have sufficient \u201cboots on the ground\u201d to ferret out all forms of bad behavior within a giant, global, financial institution.  Moreover, regardless what supervisors want to do, a good culture cannot simply be mandated by regulation or imposed by supervision.\n\nIn conclusion, if those of you here today as stewards of these large financial institutions do not do your part in pushing forcefully for change across the industry, then bad behavior will undoubtedly persist.  If that were to occur, the inevitable conclusion will be reached that your firms are too big and complex to manage effectively.  In that case, financial stability concerns would dictate that your firms need to be dramatically downsized and simplified so they can be managed effectively.  It is up to you to address this cultural and ethical challenge.  The consequences of inaction seem obvious to me\u2014they are both fully appropriate and unattractive\u2014compared to the alternative of improving the culture at the large financial firms and the behavior that stems from it.  So let\u2019s get on with it.\n\nThank you for your attention.\n\n1 Stephanie Chaly, James Hennessy, Steven Manzari, Hamid Mehran, Thomas Noone and Joseph Tracy contributed to this speech.\n\n2 Saabira Chaudhuri, \u201cBanks\u2019 Legal Tab Still Running Higher.\u201d Wall Street Journal, July 23, 2014.\n\n3 O\u2019Toole and Bennis, \u201cWhat\u2019s Needed Next: A Culture of Candor.\u201d Harvard Business Review, June 2009.\n\n4 Supervisory Letter SR 12-17.\n\n5 Restoring Confidence in Reference Rates\n\n6 Given the length of the vesting of this component, firms might want to allow this vesting to continue even if an individual leaves the firm. That is, one may not want an individual\u2019s accumulated deferred debt compensation to act as a friction to job mobility. However, even if an individual leaves the firm, the debt compensation would still be at risk of forfeiture.\n\n7 See 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1829."

    "content": "Let me start by welcoming all of you to this workshop to discuss the issue of culture in the financial services industry.  This is an issue that has been on my mind for a long time.  In my view, the industry is not close to where it needs to be, and failure to address this situation should not be viewed as a viable option.  \n\nIn a speech last November, I argued that ending \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d is a prerequisite for ensuring financial stability and sustainable economic growth.1  For one thing, the excessive risk-taking undertaken by large and complex financial institutions was an important element of the financial crisis. For another, in terms of culture within these institutions, it doesn\u2019t seem like things today are much better.  An \u201capparent lack of respect for law, regulation and the public trust\u201d persists. I said that I believe that this reflects \u201cdeep-seated cultural and ethical failures.\u201d\n\nWhy did I raise this issue, and why in a speech about too big to fail? Just as excessive risk taking can cause more damage when it occurs in large, complex and interconnected financial firms; the consequences of cultural and ethical failures in these same firms are also more severe and harmful to the economy. I suggested that breaking up these large financial institutions did not seem to be the most efficient means of making the financial system more stable. But, this view was predicated on the assumptions that both the too big to fail problem and the culture problem could be solved. Correcting one but not the other would still leave the financial sector and the economy vulnerable. Or, put another way, fixing the culture problem in the finance industry is also an imperative for achieving financial stability.\n\nToday\u2019s workshop is a part of that effort. I thank all of you for your willingness to participate in what I expect will be frank and informative discussions.  Culture is not an easy thing to pin down and talk about.  Establishing and maintaining the culture of an institution takes work and constant effort, and is a journey as much as a destination\u2014you will never be quite sure if you have gotten exactly where you wanted, but you have to stay committed to the path.  I think we\u2019ll find that there are many different elements that have contributed to the current state of affairs and, likewise, an array of tools that will have to be brought to bear to move the industry\u2019s culture to where it needs to be. \n\nThis morning will be aimed at putting some parameters around the problem\u2014by looking at structural changes that have occurred in the financial sector, and at how compensation and other incentives have evolved over time. This afternoon will be focused on solutions\u2014both those that are being led by the industry itself, and those that are available to the government through enforcement.  \n\nSo let\u2019s get started.  I am now very honored to introduce Sir David Walker as our keynote speaker today.  David, as chairman of Barclays, a longtime member of the Group of Thirty, and in several other official capacities, has been at the forefront of corporate governance issues and efforts to reform of the industry.  David, we look forward to hearing your thoughts.  \n\n1 Ending Too Big to Fail"

    "content": "Introduction\n\nThank you Sally.  It\u2019s great to be here again this year.  I appreciate the opportunity to address this group and to continue the dialogue that we\u2019ve been having over the past several years.  As always, my remarks reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nLast year, I spoke to you about how far we had come since the crisis in addressing some of the most pressing issues.  I also shared my thoughts on areas that still needed to be addressed and where I thought more concerted effort was needed.  There were four areas I focused on:\n\nIn general, the issues that keep me awake at night haven\u2019t changed much\u2014and I\u2019ll touch on a few that remain at the forefront of my insomnia later in my remarks.  But, I\u2019d like to start today by delving a little deeper into an overriding theme that heightens my concerns\u2014and that is the challenge of operating in a \u201cglobal\u201d business and regulatory environment, while at the same time navigating an increasingly \u201clocal\u201d business and regulatory environment.\n\nGlobal vs. Local\n\nThe evolution of financial services over the past several decades has resulted in a truly global financial system.  Advances in information technology and data management, as well as the development of robust capital markets, greater competition among financial firms and international trade, among other things, have contributed to a faster, more highly interconnected, and more available financial marketplace.  The financial crisis confirmed that what was once a fragmented and siloed system was now truly global:  failures in one jurisdiction quickly transmitted disruption to other jurisdictions. \n\nDuring the crisis, we clearly saw the interconnectedness of firms, the complexity of the international financial system, and the global impact of bank failures.  Through this experience, we identified gaps and weaknesses, both globally and locally, and supervisors, regulators and lawmakers from around the world all set out to put a system in place to avoid a repeat of one of the most economically devastating periods in our history.\n\nThere has been substantial effort on the part of global regulatory and supervisory bodies to address the weaknesses identified in the financial crisis.  The work of the Basel Committee on capital and liquidity standards, as well as the work of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) on cross-border resolution, are but a few examples of the hard work that global bodies have been undertaking to address the weaknesses identified through the crisis.\n\nAt the same time, national authorities have been working hard both to implement the agreed-upon global fixes, but also to develop and execute appropriate remedies for problems identified at the national (or local) level.  Locally, while appreciating the need to address the crisis on a global scale, many countries saw the need to be in a better position to safeguard their own.  The bottom line, in fact, was:  the crisis was global, but the impact was felt locally.  Global in life; local in death, as the saying goes.\n\nSo, while authorities have endeavored to develop and implement common global rules across a wide range of issues, many national authorities have simultaneously moved to develop and implement national standards\u2014that may conflict with or appear at odds with a barrier-free and harmonized financial system that allows the free flow of capital and competition across the globe.  National rules that require local capital and local liquidity are two examples of standards that may present challenges to the efficient and effective operations of global firms.  It will be important for firms to be in a position to meet both sets of requirements.\n\nWhat I\u2019d like to offer in my remarks today are some steps I see as necessary for institutions navigating in this new environment to begin to address the concerns I\u2019ve outlined above.  And, I\u2019ll close with a couple of issues that remain on my \u201cinsomnia\u201d list that will continue to warrant increased efforts in the coming year. \n\n What Will it Take for Firms to Navigate in this New Environment?\n\nAddressing the Weaknesses\n\nI\u2019d like to start first with a fundamental observation:  we need to focus first on fixing what was so obviously broken.  The new sets of rules and regulations, whether global or local, were designed to address the very weaknesses that led to bad outcomes during the financial crisis:  low levels and quality of capital; insufficient liquidity; fundamental weaknesses in a range of risk management practices; poor management information and reporting systems; complex structures and systems that couldn\u2019t be quickly taken apart; and the list goes on.\n\nWe know we need a more resilient system that is able to withstand a wider range of stresses, as well as provide buffers when firms do falter.  And, importantly, we need to do this to restore confidence in the financial system.  The new rules and regulations are intended to address the known weaknesses, and before we can talk about whether the global business model is viable or how to operate more efficiently within the constraints imposed, the basic underpinnings of a strong and resilient financial system need to be in place and functioning. \n\nWith that said, here in the U.S., the Enhanced Prudential Standards (EPS) are at the core of strengthening both U.S. firms and the U.S. operations of foreign firms and ensure a level playing field for all firms doing business in the U.S.  With the final rules published earlier this year, firms have begun the work necessary to implement changes to meet the expectations set out in the new rules. \n\nNot surprisingly, we are seeing a number of challenges faced by FBOs (foreign banking organizations) in meeting the expectations of the EPS, among these challenges are:\n\nOnce needed structural changes are in place, the internal culture comes into play.  Culture can be a complex topic, but we know it is an important one.  When we talk about culture, we talk about it from a number of different perspectives.  The culture within the organization will guide the behavior of employees.  Therefore, if the organizational values conflict with the rules/guidance you are required to follow, the organization is headed for trouble.  It\u2019s important for firms to understand \u201cwhy\u201d certain regulation are in place and appreciate the value of following them, even when the rules may seem to be inconsistent with a home country\u2019s position.  If a clear understanding and appreciation of the \u201cwhy\u201d is lacking, it is more likely that staff may look to loopholes.\n\nAs Tom Baxter, our General Counsel says, \u201cThis failure to correlate the rule with the value is the root of real mischief.\u201d\n\nAs firms continue to work on improving their culture, there are a number of themes that should drive their efforts.  First, culture starts at the top of the organization\u2014and when I say top, I mean all the way at the top, not just in a particular jurisdiction.  Senior leaders and boards of directors around the world must lead by example and demonstrate to local leadership the firm\u2019s underlying values through their actions, not just their words.  (Practice what you preach.)\n\nIncentives within the firm should be designed to set the right expectations for behavior, and recognition programs should clearly reward desired actions, not just financial performance.  At the end of the day, culture is fundamentally about people, and we shouldn\u2019t forget that. \n\nHaving the right culture in place is not a \u201cnice to have\u201d in a firm, it is a \u201cmust have.\u201d Some say that the financial industry is late to recognize the need to address culture\u2014I say we can\u2019t wait any longer.\n\nWe are spending a lot of time discussing culture internally at the Fed right now, so expect to hear more about it in the near future.\n\nAdjusting as Necessary and Engaging in Dialogue\n\nAs firms are developing and implementing changes, such as the ones I mentioned, to meet the requirements of the Enhanced Prudential Standards, it is important to refine the business strategy of the U.S. operations. We all know that regulation in markets is nothing new and what it requires is a better analysis by firms on the cost of doing business in different markets compared to profitability.  For some firms, we see aggressive actions to adjust their geographic footprints to avoid, at least for a time, the impact of the new standards.  For other firms, we see productive and realistic discussions about how to address the new standards, including how booking models and other business operations need to change.  In addition, we are seeing home country supervisors engaging in discussions with firms, asking important questions about how host country rules and regulations will affect group operations and seeking to understand the knock-on effects of the new rules across the global operations. \n\nAs firms are adapting both business strategies and operations to meet home country and host country rules and regulations, we are hearing about the challenges that have been identified.  However, there is still a lack of specificity around these challenges, including quantifying the impact\u2014on business, strategy, customers and staff; identifying potential near-term mitigants; and developing proposals on potential longer-term solutions that could be the basis of a productive dialogue.  Rhetoric is fine, but it\u2019s not enough.  We need to understand on a more concrete level how these changes are going to impact the firm, from your clients to your operations, from your business models to your culture.  We have been hearing some of this, but more specific examples and solid data is needed to be in a position to address the issues.\n\nRemaining Issues on My Insomnia List \n\nTurning now to the issues that still keep me awake at night, I will highlight three of these today:  (1) AML/BSA (yet again); (2) information technology; and (3) communication and coordination.   \n\n1. AML/BSA\n\nThe world of AML/BSA keeps growing.  What started out decades ago as a US-centric emphasis on hindering drug trafficking has transformed into a global framework that addresses a range of criminal activity, anti-terrorism, arms proliferation, and tax avoidance.  As I know you are aware, the bar keeps rising, as well as the stakes.  This past year has seen\u2014again\u2014significant public enforcement actions, some together with huge fines.\n\nI think we\u2019ve been clear in our expectations around AML/BSA:\n\nAs I know you are also aware, we are seeing keen competition for talent/resources in this area.  While we recognize that it may be difficult to identify and retain talent, having a solid recruiting strategy and ongoing training in place, as I mentioned earlier, are important components to addressing the problem.\n\nYou might wonder why this topic remains on my list\u2014and it\u2019s because in spite of the heavy public attention on the matter, including a range of public enforcement actions, it remains a work in progress for many firms.  And, for firms that haven\u2019t yet been faced with MRAs or a public enforcement action, I worry about complacency.  So, I raise it again because it seems that another warning shot is warranted. \n\n2. Information Technology\n\nMy second worry is about the broad area of information technology\u2014and this has really a couple of dimensions to it.  The first is legacy:  that most firms still have so much \u201cclean-up\u201d to do to fix longstanding technology and data issues that have built up over the years:  systems don\u2019t talk with one another; data aggregation takes days or weeks, when the needs are really more immediate; and data quality isn\u2019t what it needs to be.  So, there is still a significant amount of basic blocking and tackling that needs to be done.\n\nThe second dimension that concerns me is the competitive landscape for financial institutions in the digital world.  As more and more non-financial entities are entering the financial arena, like Amazon, Apple, peer to peer lenders, and others, I worry that financial firms lack the agility and ability to compete at the level that they need to\u2014particularly with the constraints of regulation.  At the end of the day, will financial firms be able to compete in the same way\u2014or will these largely unregulated players be the future of our financial system? \n\nThe final dimension I\u2019m certain won\u2019t surprise you\u2014and that\u2019s cybersecurity.  I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t have to explain too much why this keeps me awake at night, but suffice it to say that as I think about the kinds of risks that might cause the next crisis, cybersecurity is the one that worries me the most.  I think we\u2019ve done a reasonable job in developing rules and regulations to address the causes of the last crisis, and firms are in the process of building the resilience to withstand those types of shocks.  But, cyber adds an element to planning for the next crisis that goes beyond what additional capital and liquidity can provide to the system. \n\nI recognize that the topic seems daunting, but it has to be addressed soon, if you want to survive and not just comply with regulations.  It is an area that will continue to warrant attention across the industry\u2014and will require a level of coordination and collaboration between the public and private sectors to address in a meaningful way.  In many respects, I think we are all in this one together.\n\n3. Enhancing Coordination and Communication\n\nThe final area I wanted to highlight is coordination and communication.  The theme of enhancing coordination among supervisory and regulatory bodies is an ongoing one that I addressed last year and one that you may hear me speak about again next year.  Each year, I do think we make progress, but as increased attention is placed on ensuring the effective implementation of local (or host country) rules and regulations, we need to ensure we don\u2019t lose sight of the need to continue to work effectively across jurisdictions in supervising the largest firms.\n\nThere are challenges that still exist in coordinating across multiple agencies\u2014domestically and internationally and, at times, with competing agendas (e.g., prudential vs. conduct).  As well, there remain some challenges to effectively sharing information, and while some legal impediments have been resolved, the seamless exchange of information is not yet the norm among key supervisors. \n\nI do believe that the trust level is building among supervisors as a result of the hard work over the past couple of years, but this will be an ongoing effort as players change and circumstances evolve.  There have been several opportunities over the past year to test some of the close coordination among supervisors and regulators, and I think they have provided valuable experience\u2014and lessons learned\u2014for those involved.  What I think has been clearest in those lessons is the ongoing need to coordinate\u2014to ensure that problems are well understood from each vantage point or jurisdiction, that mitigants are discussed and implemented as necessary, and that all stakeholders are well informed\u2014all of this to ensure that problems don\u2019t become systemic. \n\nA final point on enhancing coordination and communication is ensuring that supervisors continue to develop an understanding of the impact of the new rules and regulations across global organizations. \n\nAs I noted earlier, there is recognition that regulatory changes are affecting strategies, business models, and business activities in a meaningful way\u2014and that this is occurring across organizations (not just locally).  At the same time, we recognize that it\u2019s not just individual business lines or firms that are affected, but regulatory changes are having an impact on markets as well.  We, collectively, need to spend more time identifying and understanding these impacts as well\u2014and we need to work across jurisdictions to do that. \n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion\u2014we all have a lot to do!\n\nFirst, though, firms need to focus on fixing what was so completely broken\u2014firms were too complicated, MIS was weak, risk management was poor, compliance programs were ineffective and governance was questionable. \n\nOnce that hard work is on track\u2014and substantially in place\u2014we need to engage in a productive two-way dialogue about the challenges that firms are facing.  As I said earlier, rhetoric is fine (and I understand much of this), but without specifics, it\u2019s difficult to know whether the outcomes were intended or not.  Yes, we did intend for you to be less complicated and complex; yes, given the weaknesses, we did intend for capital and liquidity to provide assurances to home and host supervisors; and, yes, we do want to know more about your senior management and expect much more interaction with them.\n\nAt times, our outcomes may appear to be in conflict:  we want smooth efficient markets that support global growth AND we want a strong, resilient, safe financial system.  Our challenge is how to balance those.  As we strive to find the balance, it is important that we engage with you\u2014the industry.  And, it needs to be productive engagement.  We need honest, frank and educated discussions, we need concrete examples, we need solid data, and we need to work together to gain a better understanding of a shared goal and how to get there. \n\nThank you for your attention."

    "content": "Good afternoon.  I am pleased to be here today at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI).  It is always a pleasure to speak with members of the different communities that make up our region, and it is particularly exciting to have the opportunity to speak with the students and faculty here at the Lally School of Management and Technology.  Much of my day in the Albany area has been focused on the intersection of technology, the workforce and innovation, so it is a pleasure to speak with the people who are the future leaders in this fascinating evolution.\n\nMy meeting with you today is part of our continuing efforts to understand what is going on at the grassroots level of our economy. Earlier on this trip, I met with government and business leaders to learn about some of the challenges the region faces as well as the collaborative efforts being taken to further economic development.  I listened to community leaders describe the problems in affordable housing, workforce development and employment facing many in the lower income communities.  I was also impressed by the potential innovations in energy production at the GE Global Research Center.  These could have large consequences not only in the United States but in developing nations as well.\n\nWe plan these trips so I can meet with a diverse array of representatives.  This allows me to get a comprehensive picture of economic conditions in the region and a fuller understanding of the major issues and concerns. This is our fifth trip to Upstate New York in the past few years. Other recent trips have taken us to Northern New Jersey, the boroughs of New York City, Long Island and Fairfield County, Connecticut.\n\nMy outreach trips complement the ongoing efforts of the New York Fed to assess conditions in the Upstate New York economy and throughout our District. We monitor economic performance on a monthly basis through special indexes we have created and through our monthly surveys of New York State manufacturers and business leaders in the non-manufacturing sector. We also get important input on economic conditions from our Upstate Advisory Board, whose members play important roles in the Upstate economy. We conduct a biannual poll of small businesses to understand their credit needs and availability.  The results of one particular poll led us to develop a series of clinics for small businesses to help them take the next step to access capital and identify new sources of funding.  We have constructed a consumer credit panel that allows us to better understand the financial condition of U.S. households and students. More recently, we extended this national analysis to include more detail about the states in our district, including a profile of households in New York State and the Albany area.  We look at how much consumers are borrowing, what they are borrowing for and if they are experiencing difficulties in making their payments. \n\nAs I mentioned earlier, we are always eager to engage with students, and our commitment to the region includes a number of educational programs worth highlighting. First, Math x Economics, which encourages students attending schools serving lower-income families to consider a career in finance or economics. And, second, our yearly Fed Challenge competitions, in which teams of students from high schools and colleges in the District take on the roles of the members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and debate what the appropriate next step is for U.S. monetary policy.\n\nAll in all, there is a lot to keep myself and my colleagues fully engaged with the communities we represent.\n\nLet me now review recent developments in the national and regional economy, and at the end of my talk, I will be happy to answer questions you may have about the economic outlook.\n\nAs always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nNational Economic Conditions\n\nSince the official end of the Great Recession more than five years ago, the U.S. economy has grown at a disappointing 2.2 percent compound annual rate. Several times over that period it looked as though growth was breaking out on the upside, but each time such hopes were dashed.\n\nWe are again at a similar junction.  A wide array of economic indicators now suggest that growth in the U.S. has picked up and is widely expected to be around 3 percent during the second half of 2014 and in 2015. \n\nThese forecasts seem quite reasonable to me and are consistent with views I have expressed in the past.  Various \u201cheadwinds\u201d have been impeding economic activity, but some of these forces have gradually subsided, allowing the substantially improved underlying fundamentals to exert themselves more forcefully. For example, fiscal restraint, which was a big factor last year, has subsided and is likely to disappear altogether next year.  Credit availability has also improved, reflecting healthier bank balance sheets and improving job and income prospects for prospective borrowers.  In addition, the excess supply of housing built up over the boom of the previous decade has been worked off, and both home prices and rents suggest that the supply of housing is not keeping pace with demand.\n\nThis has allowed supportive financial market conditions, spurred, in part, by a very accommodative monetary policy, to shine through.  As a result, aggregate household net worth has climbed relative to income and consumer balance sheets are healthier.  On the business side,  financial markets conditions suggest that risk aversion has  subsided,  leading to some firming in business investment spending. All of these developments help boost the confidence of consumers and businesses that this consensus forecast will in fact unfold.\n\nOf course, as with any forecast, there is some meaningful chance that growth will be either weaker or stronger than the point forecast.  While I believe that the risks around this consensus forecast are reasonably well balanced, I also believe that the likelihood that growth will be substantially stronger than the point forecast is probably relatively low. \n\nSeveral factors lead me to this conclusion. First, despite the fact that the household deleveraging process appears to be largely over and aggregate household net worth has been restored to pre-crisis levels, consumer spending is not as strong as one might expect given these conditions.  As a result, the personal saving rate is currently significantly above what the historical relationship between household net worth and personal saving would suggest.  There are several potential explanations for this development.  Access to credit, while certainly improved, is probably still not fully restored, particularly for those with less than sterling credit histories.  It is also quite likely that, in the wake of the deep recession and relatively sluggish growth of the past five years, households have higher than normal levels of precautionary saving. \n\nAnother reason for seeing less than normal upside risk for consumer spending is that the growth stimulus from the consumer durable goods cycle is likely to weaken going forward. For example, sales of light-weight motor vehicles have steadily recovered from a low of 9.4 million units (annual rate) at the depths of the recession to an average of nearly 17 million units over the three months ending in September.  The fastest pace of sales in the previous business cycle was 17 million units for all of 2005. While there may be some additional upside potential to these sales given the quite long period over which they were depressed relative to fundamentals, it seems unlikely that they will continue to grow at the rate they have over the past few years. \n\nHousing is another area where the upside risks are likely to be less than what we might expect under more normal conditions.  We have seen an impressive recovery of multi-family housing starts over the past few years. However, starts of single-family homes continue to languish at relatively low levels despite the fact that home prices have risen substantially over the past two years and mortgage rates remain quite low.  Mortgage lenders continue to be extremely risk averse and mortgage credit to those with lower credit scores is still significantly constrained.  There is nothing on the horizon that would lead me to believe that situation will change in a material way any time soon.  \n\nLastly, over the past few months the exchange value of the dollar has appreciated while growth prospects of key trading partners, particularly the Euro Area, have dimmed.  Of course, the appreciation of the dollar is likely due in part to increasing confidence that growth prospects in the U.S. have improved.  Therefore, this development does not mean we should abandon the consensus forecast. Rather, as with the other issues I have discussed, I view this development as limiting the upside risk to that forecast. \n\nDespite the limiting factors discussed above, the pace of growth envisioned in the consensus forecast implies that overall labor market conditions will continue to improve. But there is a great deal of uncertainty about the resulting path of the unemployment rate, with some forecasters expecting a fairly steep decline to around 5 percent by the end of 2015, while others anticipate a much more gradual decline.  \n\nIn addition to how strong output grows, the ultimate path of the unemployment rate will also depend on the behavior of productivity growth and the labor force participation rate.  The labor force participation rate has declined a great deal since 2007, the previous cyclical peak, due to a combination of demographic factors and protracted cyclical weakness in labor demand. The behavior of the participation rate and its likely future path is an issue we continue to monitor and study intently.  While I still believe that the participation rate could move back up again as the demand for labor strengthens, I am less confident about this than earlier as the downward trend in participation rates has persisted even as the labor market has improved.  What I can say with greater certainty is that there still is a significant underutilization of labor market resources.  I come to this conclusion after assessing many labor market indicators, not just the level of the unemployment rate.  For example, the fact that the rate of growth of labor compensation costs remains so subdued is consistent with this conclusion.   \n\nWith respect to prices, inflation has been running somewhat below the Federal Reserve\u2019s objective of a 2 percent annualized rate for the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator.  The latest Congressional Budget Office forecast has the four-quarter percent change of the core PCE deflator moving up from 1\u00bd percent in the second quarter of 2014 to 1.9 percent by the fourth quarter of 2015. As with growth, I find this forecast to be quite reasonable, but would argue that the risks are on the side that inflation moves upwards more slowly than this. First, the appreciation of the dollar and weakening of foreign growth prospects that I mentioned earlier both act to dampen inflation pressures.  Second, energy production in the U.S. is rising much faster than I would have guessed just a few years ago, helping to reduce energy prices which in turn reduces a wide range of production and distribution costs.  Lastly, I would note that research suggests that inflation expectations play a very important role in the inflation process. Those expectations remain well anchored at the present time, despite concerns by some that the amount of slack in the economy has declined substantially.  I am quite confident that those expectations will remain well anchored in the future, limiting the increase in inflation set in motion by faster growth and further reductions in slack. \n\nSo what does this imply for monetary policy?  We have made substantial progress with respect to the labor market outlook since we began our current program of large scale asset purchases in 2012.  Because it looks very likely that the program will have fulfilled its objectives, I expect to support a decision to end the asset purchase program at the end of this month.  At the same time, it still is premature to begin to raise interest rates\u2014the labor market still has too much slack and the inflation rate is too low.  The consensus view is that lift-off will take place around the middle of next year.  That seems like a reasonable view to me.   But, again, it is just a forecast.  What we do will depend on the flow of economic news and how that affects the economic outlook.  For example, firmer growth, higher inflation, and a more rapid tightening of the labor market could cause us to move earlier.  Conversely, should economic growth disappoint, the timing of lift-off could be pushed later.    \n\nI hope the economy cooperates.  If it does and lift-off begins sometime next year, that will be something to be very excited about.  It will signal that the economy is finally getting healthier and that the Fed is getting closer to achieving its dual mandate objectives of maximum sustainable employment and price stability. That would be very good news even if it were to cause a bump or two in financial markets.  \n\nRegional Economic Conditions\n\nLet me now turn to economic conditions a bit closer to home. While Upstate New York outperformed the nation during the Great Recession, it has now returned to its more typical pattern of modest growth. This is not unexpected as many regions in the Northeast have tended to grow more slowly in recent decades as the population has shifted to other parts of the country and as jobs in the once dominant manufacturing industry have diminished. That being said, some parts of the region are really struggling: Syracuse, Utica, Binghamton and Elmira have all yet to see a meaningful recovery in employment, which is troubling.\n\nThe Capital region, on the other hand, is a true bright spot. While Upstate New York as a whole has gained back only a little more than half of the jobs lost during the Great Recession, Albany is close to regaining all of the jobs that were lost. Though the Capital region\u2019s public sector has exerted some downward pressure on job growth during the recovery, the education and health care sectors have been an ongoing source of stability and strength for the region. Employment in the education sector has climbed nearly 25 percent since the end of the recession, an increase of around 5,000 jobs, and the health care sector has added about 3,000 jobs.\n\nAnd there\u2019s some especially good news to report from the Capital region\u2019s manufacturing sector: jobs are growing, and growing quite strongly\u2014a testament to the success of the area\u2019s burgeoning high tech sector. Since the recovery began, the area has added over 4,000 manufacturing jobs, many of which are tied to computers and electronics. That\u2019s an increase of nearly 25 percent. This pace of job growth is four times as great as the national pace. In fact, there are now more people employed in the Capital region\u2019s manufacturing sector than before the recession. Not many places can say that, and this is certainly not true for the nation as a whole.\n\nIn part, the success of local manufacturing reflects the presence of strong partnerships between industry and higher education. These cooperative arrangements, which help in the creation, development and commercialization of new products and processes, drive innovation and put local companies at the leading edge of technology. Moreover, these partnerships directly support local jobs. Not only are students gaining real world experience by working in shared facilities while they are in school, but strong connections between local businesses and higher education institutions help workers train for jobs that are available, and help employers find the skilled workers they need. During my last trip to the region, I saw firsthand how universities and companies can successfully work together during my visits to the State University of New York Nanotech Center and the production facilities at Global Foundries.\n\nOf course, RPI has a long history of developing cutting edge technologies and fostering start-up companies. RPI\u2019s Emerging Ventures Ecosystem initiative provides an excellent example of how a leading university can help local firms access the knowledge and intellectual property provided by its faculty and students. These types of collaborations are a key ingredient to improving the competitiveness of local businesses and increasing the relevance of the universities to the communities they serve.  We should take every opportunity to exploit these partnerships as much as possible to unleash their full potential. The strong foundation that has already been built has clearly been successful, and I expect these partnerships will support the region\u2019s economic vitality going forward. \n\nCollege Graduates Finding Jobs\n\nFinally, I know that many of you here today are students, and you may be concerned about your ability to find a good job upon graduation. There is no doubt that this is a difficult time to be graduating from college and starting your career. While finding a job has gotten a bit easier over the past few years, finding a good job can still be a challenge. Indeed, research we\u2019ve conducted at the New York Fed finds that underemployment among recent college graduates has continued to climb even as the unemployment rate has fallen. This is a troubling trend, and one we are actively trying to better understand.\n\nDespite the challenges now facing recent college graduates, I want to assure you that the value of a college degree remains high. While the Great Recession and its aftermath have made it more difficult to find a job out of college these past few years, those without a college degree have had an even tougher time. Students who major in technical fields\u2014such as engineering, mathematics and computer science\u2014have tended to have a much easier time finding a good job and have earned a high return on their educational investment.  Although it is true that the labor market has been difficult for college graduates in recent years, I am confident that most of you will find good jobs, especially as the labor market continues to improve.\n\nThank you for your kind attention and I would now be happy to take some questions."

    "content": "Thank you, Rob.  I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this important event.  Securities financing markets are essential to the efficient functioning of the global financial system, and to the implementation of monetary policy in the United States and abroad. \n\nAs you know, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) recently published a statement on its policy normalization principles and plans.  Today I would like to talk about these principles, and more specifically, about how the Committee plans to raise and control short-term interest rates when it becomes appropriate to do so.  Obviously, these plans are of interest to the Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) as we must implement the directives issued by the FOMC after each meeting, and I am responsible for reporting to the FOMC on the transactions made to meet its operating target.  I\u2019ll also review the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) operations that the Federal Reserve has been testing for the past year, and explain recent changes the Committee made to these operations.  Of course, the principles and continued testing are part of prudent planning, and do not imply that normalization will necessarily begin soon.  As always, the views I express are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nThe Committee\u2019s Normalization Principles and Plans\n\nLet me start by briefly reviewing the statement on normalization principles and plans that the FOMC published following its September meeting.\n\nImportantly, this statement is intended to provide the public with information about the eventual normalization process and does not signal a change in the current or future stance of policy.  As the Committee indicated in its September post-meeting policy statement, it continues to anticipate that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. \n\nMany elements of the normalization principles and plans are similar to the principles adopted by the Committee in June 2011, while others have been revised in light of the changes since then in the size and composition of the System Open Market Account (SOMA), the Fed\u2019s securities portfolio, as well as enhancements in the tools the Committee will have available to implement policy during normalization. \n\nAs was the case before the crisis and indicated in the June 2011 principles, the Committee intends to adjust the policy stance during normalization primarily through actions that directly influence the level of the fed funds rate and other short-term interest rates rather than through active management of the size or composition of the Fed\u2019s securities holdings.  Specifically, when economic conditions and the economic outlook warrant a less accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will raise its target range for the fed funds rate.  During normalization, the Committee intends to move the fed funds rate into the target range primarily by adjusting the rate of interest on excess reserve balances (IOER) that it pays.  We expect changes in the IOER rate to have a significant influence on the fed funds rate and other short-term interest rates.  However, to help control the fed funds rate, the Committee also intends to use an ON RRP facility and other supplementary tools, as needed.  The Committee will use an ON RRP facility only to the extent necessary, and will phase it out when it is no longer needed to help control the funds rate.  \n\nWith regard to the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, the Committee intends to reduce securities holdings in a gradual and predictable manner, primarily by ceasing to reinvest repayments of principal on securities held in the SOMA.  The Committee expects to cease or commence phasing out reinvestments after it begins increasing the target range for the fed funds rate; the timing will depend on how economic and financial conditions and the economic outlook evolve.  The Committee currently does not anticipate selling agency mortgage-backed securities as part of the normalization process, although limited sales might be warranted in the longer run to reduce or eliminate residual holdings.  In the longer run, the Committee intends to hold no more securities than it will need to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively, and that the SOMA will consist primarily of Treasury securities. \n\nGiven the $1.6 trillion in large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs) conducted since September 2012, the level of reserve balances in the system will be significantly higher during normalization than was envisioned when the 2011 principles were adopted.  In light of this, as I just outlined, the FOMC has judged it appropriate to operate with a framework for interest rate control that is based primarily on administered rates rather than reserve draining tools.  Given the unprecedented nature of this framework, the Committee has made clear that it is prepared to adjust the details of its approach in light of economic and financial developments.  The FOMC has consistently adapted its policies as needed in recent years and will no doubt continue to do so as necessary throughout the normalization process in order to foster conditions consistent with its dual mandate. \n\nThe Framework for Interest Rate Control during Normalization\n\nNow I\u2019d like to talk in more detail about the plans and tools for influencing short-term interest rates that the FOMC will use when it becomes appropriate to raise rates.\n\nA target range for the fed funds rate\n\nAs I noted, during normalization the Committee will continue to communicate the stance of policy through a target for the federal funds rate.  The fed funds rate is an overnight, unsecured interest rate in the market for reserves\u2014the rate at which banks and certain other eligible entities borrow or lend balances held at the Fed.2\n\nThe Committee also agreed that it would continue to set a target range for the federal funds rate during normalization.  When the FOMC begins to remove accommodation, the level of reserves in the banking system will be very high and the Federal Reserve will be employing new tools to implement policy.  Against this backdrop, the Committee has chosen to establish a target range, rather than a point target, in order to provide an appropriate degree of flexibility in policy implementation.\n\nA key advantage to targeting the fed funds rate is that the Committee has done so successfully for many decades.  As a result, it\u2019s a familiar rate for the public in judging the stance of monetary policy, and its continued use simplifies the Fed\u2019s communications. \n\nWhile the Committee has targeted the fed funds rate for many decades, activity in the fed funds market has changed considerably in recent years.  Prior to the crisis, many banks typically borrowed fed funds in order to satisfy reserve requirements or obtain short-term financing.  In recent years, however, the Fed\u2019s LSAPs have led to very high levels of reserve balances, and thus reduced the need for banks to borrow fed funds to meet reserve requirements and clear payments.3 As a result, trading activity in the fed funds market today is smaller and the nature of that activity is different than it was prior to the crisis.4\n\nNevertheless, a new Federal Reserve data collection that captures both brokered and bilateral transactions shows that trading activity in fed funds remains significant.5  These data indicate that daily trading volumes are about $60 billion and are relatively stable.  Moreover, longer-term correlations between the fed funds rate and other money market rates remain robust.  As a result, the fed funds rate continues to be a suitable measure of the marginal cost of funding for banks, and remains connected over medium-term horizons to other short-term interest rates that also matter for the transmission of monetary policy. \n\nMoving the fed funds rate into the target range\n\nDuring normalization, the Fed intends to move the fed funds rate into the target range established by the FOMC primarily by adjusting the IOER rate.  \n\nA key development in the conduct of monetary policy in recent years was the introduction of the Fed\u2019s ability to pay interest on reserve balances held by depository institutions.  In the environment of elevated reserve balances that resulted from the Fed\u2019s asset purchases, the payment of IOER\u2014currently at a rate of \u00bc percent\u2014has helped to keep the fed funds rate within its target range.6\n\nThe IOER rate is the rate of return on a riskless overnight deposit held at the Fed.  As such, it may be thought of as the opportunity cost of making an alternative investment, such as a loan or the purchase of a security.  Accordingly, if all money market participants were eligible to earn interest on reserves, money market rates would likely be at least as high as the IOER rate; no institution would want to lend to a private entity at a lower rate.  Even without universal access to IOER, in the absence of frictions, competition would be expected to lift money market rates up to the level of the IOER rate, since banks would make an arbitrage profit on any funds they borrow at a lower rate and deposit at the Fed.  Because the investment with the Fed is riskless, little or no economic capital would be needed to support such arbitrage by banks.  In this way, the IOER rate should theoretically form a \u201cfloor\u201d beneath short-term interest rates, allowing the Fed to achieve its target for the fed funds rate even with a very high level of reserve balances. \n\nIn practice, however, many lenders in the U.S. money markets are not banks and so cannot earn IOER.  Moreover, from the perspective of a potential lender to a bank, the arbitrage transaction I just described is not riskless.  As a result, many lenders limit their risk exposure to any individual bank, reducing the force of competition in the market for funds.7\n\nIn addition, while banks do not need economic capital to conduct this arbitrage, they do face regulatory balance sheet costs from expanding their assets, even in the form of excess reserves, that is, cash.  Some of these costs are direct, such as the FDIC fees paid by domestic banks on their liabilities less capital and transactions costs in brokered markets, while others relate to the costs associated with regulatory requirements on capital and liquidity ratios.  Even if the market for funds were perfectly competitive, these costs should drive a wedge between IOER and other money market rates.  As a result, the IOER rate does not directly establish a firm floor under money market rates, but instead can be thought of as a magnet, with the strength of its pull determined by these balance sheet and competitive frictions.  While these frictions may vary over time, they should generally do so only slowly.8\n\nThe pull of IOER should also be affected by the quantity of reserves in the system.  An increase in bank reserves that increases bank assets makes regulatory leverage ratios more binding, raising the shadow marginal cost of bank balance sheets.  It also accentuates the competitive frictions I described above, and reduces individual bank demand for additional reserves.9  As a result, as the level of reserves declines during normalization, marginal balance sheet costs should fall, competitive frictions should lessen, and the demand for additional reserves from individual banks should increase.  These factors should strengthen the magnetic attraction of IOER and pull the fed funds rate and other market rates up toward\u2014and at some point equal to or above\u2014the IOER rate.  However, excess reserves will remain plentiful for some time, and while that\u2019s the case the FOMC intends to use an ON RRP facility and other tools as needed to complement IOER in controlling the fed funds rate.10\n\nWhen the Desk conducts ON RRPs, as in its current testing program, it sells Treasury securities held in the SOMA with an agreement to buy them back the next business day at a pre-determined price.  This leaves the size of the SOMA portfolio unchanged, but shifts some of the liabilities on the Fed\u2019s balance sheet from bank reserves to reverse repos.  Similar to IOER for banks, ON RRPs provide a risk-free overnight investment directly to a broad range of bank and non-bank counterparties.  By reaching financial institutions that are ineligible to earn IOER, an ON RRP facility widens the universe of counterparties that should generally be unwilling to lend at rates below those available from the Fed.  Such a facility could also enhance competition in money markets by offering an alternative safe investment and thus strengthening the bargaining position of non-bank lenders.  Moreover, by reducing the amount of reserves held by banks, ON RRPs may directly reduce the level of bank assets and thus balance sheet costs.11\n\nIf ON RRPs are offered at a fixed rate below the level of market rates that would be produced by IOER alone given prevailing frictions, the ON RRPs should not be an attractive investment option in normal times.  As a result, their availability should have little effect on market rates.  If, however, ON RRPs are offered above the level of money market rates that would be produced by IOER alone given prevailing frictions, ON RRPs should become attractive and help to form a floor for money market rates, either directly through increased take-up that reduces reserves or indirectly through the competitive pressure I described.  Since money funds\u2014the majority of the Fed\u2019s ON RRP counterparties\u2014don\u2019t face the same balance sheets costs as banks, the floor formed by ON RRPs should be relatively firm.\n\nWhile ON RRPs are a potentially useful tool for monetary policy control with large amounts of excess reserves, FOMC and market participants have noted the potential for very large regular usage to alter patterns of financial intermediation.  Further, a fixed-rate structure with no usage limits could exacerbate liquidity pressures during times of stress.12  The FOMC recently authorized testing of a cap on the total daily usage of the ON RRPs that could help mitigate these risks.  I\u2019ll return to these risks and some ways that they may be mitigated in a bit.\n\nIn sum, arbitrage activities by banks, complemented as needed by ON RRP operations, should cause a higher IOER rate to lead to higher levels of market rates.  However, if the pressure on market rates from the Fed\u2019s administered rates turns out to be insufficient, the Committee has a range of other tools\u2014including term deposits, term RRPs, and asset sales\u2014that could be used to help tighten the stance of policy.  Given the array of tools at our disposal, I am confident that the FOMC can adjust and control short-term interest rates as needed to foster its objectives of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nThe Configuration of Rates during Normalization\n\nThe Committee\u2019s normalization principles and plans do not detail the manner in which IOER as a primary tool would be combined with supplementary tools such as ON RRPs to move the fed funds rate into the target range.  However, as reflected in the minutes to the July FOMC meeting, most Committee participants anticipate that, at least initially, the IOER rate could be set at the top of the target range for the funds rate, and the ON RRP rate could be set at the bottom of that range.  This is also consistent with the views of many market participants as reflected in surveys conducted by the Desk.13  I\u2019d like to take a moment to explain why I believe such a regime would be a sensible way to implement policy during the first stages of normalization, when reserve balances will be in such ample supply.\n\nMost importantly, it\u2019s a regime in which the Desk should achieve the target for the fed funds rate set by the FOMC.  As IOER is raised, its magnetic force will pull the fed funds rate higher.  At the same time, the high level of reserve balances in the system should lead the effective rate to print below the IOER rate, at least initially during normalization.  As described earlier, if the magnetic pull of IOER alone is insufficient, ON RRPs should help to form a floor on rates by providing a risk-free, overnight asset to a broad range of non-bank investors.  As a result of these forces, the effective funds rate should generally print within the target range.\n\nThat said, as the Chair noted during her September press conference, the Committee expects that the effective fed funds rate may vary within the target range and could even move outside of it on occasion.  For example, the effective rate could move outside the target for a day or two around key financial reporting dates, such as quarter-ends, when some banks\u2019 marginal balance sheet costs are particularly high.  However, such transitory movements should have no material effect on financial conditions or the broader economy.  What matters for policy transmission is the predictability that on most days money market rates will be close to the target range set by the FOMC.14  Of course, if rates were to move substantially outside the target range and those changes were expected to persist, the Fed would take appropriate action to assure that its intended stance of policy is achieved.\n\nIn addition, as highlighted in minutes to the Committee\u2019s recent policy meetings, an operating regime with a reasonably large positive spread between the IOER and ON RRP rates would support active trading in the funds market like we see today, and would likely prevent the Fed\u2019s involvement in the repo market from growing too large.  This would, in turn, lessen the possibility that patterns of financial intermediation could be altered in unanticipated and potentially undesirable ways by the Fed\u2019s actions.  \n\nRecent Changes to the Overnight RRP Test Exercise\n\nNow I\u2019d like to return to the ON RRP testing that the Fed has been conducting over the past year, and discuss the changes to the testing exercise that were introduced following the September FOMC meeting.\n\nYou\u2019ll recall that we began testing ON RRPs in September 2013, when the Committee instructed the Desk to examine how a potential ON RRP facility might work and how it might affect short-term interest rates. \n\nThe results of the testing over the first year suggest that the operations have been successful working with IOER to establish a floor for the level of money market rates.  Our analysis has found that, offered at a spread of 20 basis points to the IOER rate, ON RRPs have kept overnight repo rates above where they would otherwise have been, in part by influencing the bargaining power of our counterparties.  All of the Desk\u2019s eligible RRP counterparty types participate in the operations, with money funds accounting for the largest share of take-up.  Take-up generally increases when the spread between market rates and the ON RRP offered rate narrows.  Take-up also rises substantially around quarter- and year-end financial reporting dates, when some money market participants\u2019 access to other overnight investments is more limited.\n\nTo further examine how ON RRPs might best be structured to supplement IOER in controlling the fed funds rate while limiting the potential for unintended effects in financial markets, the FOMC recently directed the Desk to make several changes to the design of its ON RRP operations.  In particular, as of September 22, the maximum bid limit per counterparty was raised from $10 billion to $30 billion, an overall size limit of $300 billion per operation was imposed, and an auction process was introduced to determine the interest rate on the operation and allocate take-up when the sum of bids exceeds the new $300 billion limit.15 \n\nThe $30 billion individual bid limit was informed by evidence on the desired investments of counterparties that had bid at the previous maximum of $10 billion, and it took into account the size of assets under management of our counterparties.  For almost all counterparties, the $30 billion limit is unlikely to be binding in any circumstances.  The $300 billion overall limit was above total demand observed over the first year of testing, with the exception of the operation conducted at the end of the second quarter of this year.   \n\nSo what are the benefits of moving from a structure with individual caps alone to one with an aggregate cap as well?  One benefit is that, in limiting the overall take-up but not individual take-up, an aggregate cap should produce a more efficient allocation of usage among counterparties than would a system of individual caps.  Further, an aggregate cap should better balance efficient control of money market rates under normal conditions with the risk of a destabilizing surge in use of the facility in times of stress.  The reduced risk of a surge in use in a system with an aggregate cap comes from the fact that take-up across counterparties is not perfectly correlated.  As a result, an aggregate cap that binds at some frequency can be set below the sum of individual caps that would bind for at least one of the counterparties at the same frequency.  The aggregate cap also raises the individual bargaining power of counterparties relative to a system of lower individual caps, since in normal times counterparties can be relatively certain that larger bids at the ON RRP facility will be filled.  However, the possibility that the aggregate cap could bind even in only limited circumstances may undermine this effect on bargaining power. \n\nThe Federal Reserve has been closely analyzing the results of the ON RRP operations conducted under these new testing parameters in order to further its understanding of how an ON RRP facility should be structured during the normalization process.  As many market participants anticipated the aggregate cap did bind on quarter end. The auction procedure went smoothly and while rates did trade soft on the quarter end, this was only a temporary phenomenon and there was no evidence of market disruption from the unfilled bids at the auction. \n\nAs part of its prudent planning the Committee continues to consider additional design features that may help address the potential risks associated with an ON RRP facility while preserving its ability to support the effective implementation of monetary policy during the normalization period.16\n\nIn conclusion, during normalization the FOMC will continue to communicate the stance of policy through a target for the fed funds rate, and will move the fed funds rate into the target range primarily by adjusting the IOER rate.  ON RRPs and other supplementary tools will be used as needed to control the fed funds rate.  The Committee will continue to test features of the ON RRPs to determine how a facility might best be structured to supplement IOER in the control of the funds rate while limiting the potential for unintended effects in financial markets.  Given the range of available tools, I am confident in our ability to raise short-term interest rates from the zero lower bound when the time to do so arrives.  Nevertheless, the FOMC is prepared to adjust the details of its approach to policy normalization in light of economic and financial developments and the Desk stands ready to innovate in order to efficiently and effectively implement policy consistent with the Committee\u2019s directive.  \n\nThank you.\n\n1 I would like to thank Josh Frost, Lorie Logan, and Matthew Raskin for their excellent assistance in the preparation of these remarks and colleagues in the Federal Reserve System for numerous insightful comments and suggestions.\n\n2 The effective fed funds rate is a measure of the prevailing rate in the market each day.  This is calculated as a volume-weighted average of rates on trades arranged by major brokers, and is published by the New York Fed.  See /markets/omo/dmm/fedfundsdata.cfm.\n\n3 In the five years prior to the crisis, total reserve balances averaged $20 billion and excess reserves\u2014balances in excess of those required to satisfy reserve balance requirements\u2014averaged about $1.5 billion.  Currently, total reserve balances are about $2.8 trillion, nearly all of which are excess reserves.\n\n4 For discussion of changes in recent years to activity in the fed funds market, see the Liberty Street Economics blog posts, \u201cWho\u2019s Lending in the Fed Funds Market\u201d and \u201cWho\u2019s Borrowing in the Fed Funds Market,\u201d at http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/.\n\n5 The FR 2420 is a transaction-based report that collects daily data on federal funds transactions, Eurodollar transactions, and certificates of deposits from domestically chartered commercial banks and thrifts that have $26 billion or more in total assets and from U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks with total third-party assets of $900 million or more.  The FR 2420 data is used to support the implementation of monetary policy and the analysis of money market conditions.\n\n6 The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is responsible for setting the rate of interest on reserves.  Since December 16, 2008, the interest rates on required reserve balances and excess reserve balances have both been \u00bc percent, but the rates need not be the same.  More information can be found in Regulation D.  See http://federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/reglisting.htm#D.\n\n7 Moreover, competition may be imperfect in some money markets currently, allowing spreads to persist longer than they would if markets were more competitive.  For example, much money market activity is over-the-counter, potentially leading to search frictions and bargaining.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that lenders typically interact directly with a relatively small number of counterparties, perhaps because a portion of the activity is derived from costly relationship lending.  Finally, to limit counterparty credit risk, lenders sometimes seek to diversify their lending and apply concentration limits, which are often binding.\n\n8 As I\u2019ll explain, high-frequency variation in balance sheet costs could induce high-frequency changes in the pull of IOER and, in turn, the spread between the IOER and money market rates.  We see this transitory dynamic around financial statement reporting dates.  On these dates, balance sheet costs for some banks increase, and the fed funds rate and other money market rates fall relative to the IOER rate.\n\n9 While actions that increase bank reserves do not necessarily increase bank assets, evidence suggests that for LSAPs conducted through 2012:Q3, assets were ultimately sourced primarily from non-banks\u2014households (including hedge funds), broker-dealers, and insurance companies.  All else equal, this would imply that the purchases increased bank assets.  See Carpenter, Demiralp, Ihrig, and Klee (2013).  Even if bank assets do not increase, an increase in reserves could create distortions that raise balance sheet costs.  This could happen if banks shift the composition of their assets to accommodate the increase in reserves, and in doing so are pushed away from their optimal balance sheet composition.\n\n10 These other tools include the Term Deposit Facility, term RRPs, and asset sales, each of which would have the effect of reducing the amount of reserves held by banks.  Money market rates would rise as reserves were made scarcer through the use of these tools.  See Martin, McAndrews, Palida, and Skeie (2013) for a theoretical exploration.\n\n11 In addition to improving competition in money markets, by conducting a daily operation with a known, fixed rate, the Fed can reduce uncertainty and absorb day-to-day variations in the supply of and demand for funds and collateral. An eligible lender that cannot earn the IOER rate and that has an unexpectedly large amount of funds to invest would be able to place the funds in the ON RRP facility rather than sell them in the market at an unusually low rate. This should reduce downward pressure on money market rates.\n\n12 See the discussion in the minutes to the June and July FOMC meetings,\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20140618.htm and http://federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20140730.htm.\n\n13 See the Survey of Primary Dealers and the Survey of Market Participants.\n\n14 Indeed, even prior to 2008, the range of fed funds trading on a given day could be quite wide, and the effective rate deviated significantly at times from the target rate for a day or two.  This did not have any apparent effect on financial conditions or the economy.\n\n15 If the total amount of bids received in an operation is less than or equal to the $300 billion size limit, awards will be made at the fixed offering rate.  However, if the total amount of bids received exceeds the overall operation size limit, the $300 billion in ON RRPs will be allocated through a single-price auction using interest rates that counterparties submit with their bids.  Awards are made at a \u201cstopout rate\u201d\u2014the rate at which the overall size limit is achieved\u2014with all bids below this rate awarded in full and all bids at this rate awarded on a pro rata basis.  The stopout rate is determined by evaluating all bids in ascending order by submitted rate up to the point at which the total quantity of offers equals the overall size limit.  For more details about ON RRP operations, please see the FAQs on the New York Fed\u2019s website.\n\n16 In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has been testing a facility through which it offers term deposits to credentialed depository institutions.  Term Deposit Facility (TDF) transactions could be used to temporarily immobilize reserve balances.  An eight-week series of tests this summer explored how demand for term deposits responds to variations in the maximum individual award limits and rates.  Higher offered rates relative to IOER attracted greater use, both in the number of participants and the total dollar volumes.  The next round of TDF testing, which gets underway in October, will incorporate an early-withdrawal feature, as well as gradual increases in the maximum individual award amount and rate.

    "content": "Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today.1\n\nIn my remarks today, I will focus on the development and use of reference rates for financial market contracts.  This is a story of both spectacular success, and at the same time, spectacular failure.\n\nTo borrow from Charles Dickens:2\n\n\u201cIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity.\u2026\u201d\n\nWhile Dickens was writing about events leading up to a political crisis, his words also are apt with respect to our recent financial crisis.\n\nOver a period of just a few decades, reference rates grew greatly in terms of their role and importance in financial markets.  For example, the use of one of the best known reference rates\u2014the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR\u2014has soared, so that it is now referenced by approximately $300 trillion dollars of financial contracts.  Reference rates have become a ubiquitous but largely hidden fiber in the fabric of financial markets.  They play a critical role in making financial markets more efficient by reducing information frictions, lowering transactions costs and mitigating the moral hazard.\n\nAt the same time, as recent enforcement actions and criminal investigations have made all too clear, some of these reference rates have been systematically manipulated by individuals at key financial institutions.  The assumption that the design in how these rates are constructed would be resistant to attempts at manipulation has turned out to be wrong, and the belief in the integrity of these rates has turned out to be misplaced.\n\nWhat this means should be obvious to all of us.  Reform is required if we are to restore confidence in the financial system.  In my remarks today, I will discuss the outlines of such a reform including those important steps that are already underway, and those steps that still must be taken.  As always, my remarks reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe most recognized and prevalent of the reference interest rates is the London Interbank Offered Rate, typically referred to as LIBOR, which measures the cost of unsecured, interbank borrowing across different currencies and tenors.  The development of LIBOR goes back to the rapid expansion of the Eurodollar market in London beginning in the 1970s.  This was a market that developed, in part, as a means of circumventing the Regulation Q deposit interest rate ceilings in the United States.  This market provided a source of funds for international banks, and securities that referenced Eurodollars were issued and became actively traded.  This growing market gave birth to a new financial market product\u2014the interest rate swap\u2014to help investors and borrowers to better manage the interest rate risks associated with their financial exposures.\n\nIn 1984, as part of the \u201cBig Bang\u201d in U.K. financial markets, the British Bankers Association (BBA) assumed responsibility for developing a set of standards for these interest rate swaps.  One of these standards was for the reference rates used to fix the settlement of the contracts\u2014this led to the birth of LIBOR.3   Additional standardization followed, including establishing  a fixed schedule of settlement dates for these contracts.  This further increased the liquidity in these contracts, but also significantly concentrated the timing of settlement activity.  At the same time, new reference rates were developed that extended the LIBOR-style methodology to many different currencies.\n\nHow LIBOR was designed to work\n\nLIBOR is a set of reference rates that measure large banks\u2019 funding costs in different currencies and at different maturities.  For example, U.S. dollar LIBOR measures how expensive it is for a large bank to borrow U.S. dollars in the unsecured interbank market at different maturities.  For each currency, there is a designated panel of contributing banks that each submit an estimate of its own borrowing costs for each maturity.  For each panel, these estimates are aggregated to form LIBOR.  The LIBOR rates are then used as a basis for financial contracts ranging from adjustable rate mortgages to interest rate swaps and futures.\n\nTo make sure that the submitting banks have sufficient expertise in the funding trends in a particular currency, it is important that they be actively involved in that market.  For this reason, the contributing banks are the large banks that have been active in the London market and the panel of submitting banks varies across currencies.  The LIBOR reference rates were intended to capture on a daily basis borrowing costs along each currency-maturity combination based on the experience of the submitting banks.\n\nThe actual process for fixing LIBOR each day is quite straightforward.  Each morning the submitters from each contributing bank answer the following hypothetical question: \u201cAt what rate could you borrow funds, were you to do so by asking for and then accepting interbank offers at a reasonable market size just prior to 11 a.m.?\u201d  The transmitted submissions are ordered by rate for each currency and maturity pair.  The ordered rates for U.S. dollar LIBOR, for example, are then trimmed by generally dropping the top and bottom 25 percent of submissions to remove any influence of outliers.  The average of the remaining individual submissions is calculated and then posted.  Prior to the recent reforms, all submissions were immediately made public.\n\nThe aim of the LIBOR-setting process has been to create a set of reference rates that would be credible and would generate robust measures of bank funding costs across a wide range of market conditions.  The credibility was based on the borrowing experience from the submitting banks represented through their submitters\u2014those individuals responsible for actually submitting an answer each day to the administrator.  The potential conflicts of interest between the submitters and traders within the bank were typically handled through internal policies such as the presence of information barriers that were intended to prevent sensitive information from flowing between the traders and LIBOR submitters.  The robustness to market conditions would be maintained even in periods of market stress or a lack of transactions by the reliance on the hypothetical question instead of the use of actual transaction data.  That is, even if during stressed times when trading became sporadic in a particular currency-maturity pair, all submitters could still answer the question even if their bank did not happen to engage in any trades on that particular day in that particular pairing.   This ensured a large sample size even during stressed market conditions.  The trimming of the sample helped to minimize the influence of any outlier submission, but also limited the ability for any one submitting bank to influence the posted rate.\n\nAs is clear from the hypothetical question, LIBOR is meant to capture a bank\u2019s cost of unsecured borrowing.  This means that the reference rate will reflect not only a risk-free component, but also counterparty credit risk related to the specific borrower.  This turns out to be important for two reasons.\n\nFirst, the growing popularity and liquidity of LIBOR indexed contracts led to an expanded use of LIBOR to circumstances in which the credit risk of large banks was not clearly relevant.   For example, a speculative position about the future of short-term rates is predominately based on one\u2019s view about the path of short-term interest rates, rather than how bank counterparty risk might change and affect borrowing costs.  Despite this shortcoming, LIBOR remained popular because the benefit of its deeper market liquidity was viewed as more important than the added complication that LIBOR included an element of counterparty risk.4\n\nSecond, variations in LIBOR submissions across the submitting banks at a point in time for a given maturity should mainly reflect differences in the counterparty credit risk, since the risk-free component is common to all submitters.  This is important because it means that variations in submissions may be interpreted as reflecting variations in underlying counterparty risk.  This is particularly important when the LIBOR submissions process is transparent and the market is under stress, which was the case during the financial crisis. \n\nHow LIBOR worked in practice\n\nNow that I have described how LIBOR was intended to work in concept, how did it work in practice?  It turns out that unappreciated design weaknesses and incentive structures at certain large submitting banks, in combination with the phenomenal success of reference rates, undermined the system.  Conflicts and problems emerged both at the bank level and at the individual submitter level.  Investigations are on-going to determine the scale and full extent of these problems, but I would like to discuss a few of the well-documented problems.\n\nLet\u2019s start at the level of banks that submit estimates.  The enforcement actions and investigations into potential LIBOR manipulation have shown that, at times, individual institutions faced incentives to understate their hypothetical borrowing rates in order to avoid the perception that they might have higher counterparty credit risk.  Some of the reported misdeeds occurred during the heart of the financial crisis when market participants faced considerable uncertainty about the health of particular institutions.  This uncertainty was manifest in a wide range of financial market prices for financial institutions\u2014low and volatile equity prices, record CDS spreads and greater variation in borrowing costs across different LIBOR-submitting banks.  At that time, the BBA was publishing firm-specific contributions to LIBOR from submitting banks.  Given this publication process, some of the submitting banks reportedly became concerned about reporting a rate that would suggest that they were being treated by the market as a greater counterparty credit risk than their peers.  Accordingly, some banks were alleged to have lowered their LIBOR submission below their actual likely borrowing rate to avoid the stigma associated with posting a higher borrowing rate and the possibility that their funding costs could increase as a result.\n\nConflicts also reportedly abounded at the level of the individual submitters.  Again, these highlighted profound compliance problems at some of the submitting banks.  As I noted earlier, the intent was that the expertise of the submitter would be insulated from any internal pressures by the informational barriers within the submitting banks.  The hope was that these informational barriers separating the submitters from the traders were thick and impenetrable.  The investigations into LIBOR manipulation found that the reality was that they were often paper thin and porous.\n\nWe have learned that false reporting and manipulative behavior was pervasive across firms and over time, took many forms and was often conducted in a nonchalant manner.  This has been well-documented by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in their published findings.  For example, interest rate swap traders routinely asked colleagues to submit rates with an explicit goal to have the adjusted submission benefit the value of specific derivatives positions they held.  As an illustration, investigations discovered that one \u201cSenior Yen Trader\u201d directly or indirectly made at least 800 requests in writing on UBS\u2019s email and chat systems to their submitter.5  Requests often had a casual matter of fact nature to them.  To illustrate, an exchange in September 2007 from a trader at UBS to the submitter went as follows.6\n\n\u201cHi \u2026 could really do with a low 1M [one month] over the next few days as have 17.5m [million] fixings if ok with you?\u201d\n\nSubmitting banks often facilitated this type of behavior\u2014in some cases derivatives traders and submitters sat on the same desk, while in others the submitters were themselves traders, both circumstances obviously representing conflicts of interest.  Other investigations documented that traders at one bank would often shout across the trading desk to fellow traders to confirm that there were no conflicting requests before they sent their requests to their submitter.7\n\nThe investigations also found that not only were there conflicts within the submitting banks, but there were also active efforts by traders to collude across banks to affect the posted rates.  At times, the traders at the different banks might have similar positions and therefore a common interest to push the posted rate in particular direction.  In other times, cooperation could be incentivized through the use of \u201cwash\u201d trades that generated no profit or loss, but allowed the trader to generate commissions.\n\nWhy did this go so wrong?\n\nAs I discussed earlier, LIBOR setting involves a group of banks answering a hypothetical question.  This seemingly straightforward question actually embeds a good deal of ambiguity and room for potentially manipulative actions.  First, it is a hypothetical question\u2014not what rate did you borrow at that morning, but what rate do you think you could borrow at.  This potential disconnect from actual borrowing activity builds in from the beginning a certain amount of judgment and room for manipulation.  Second, some of the parameters\u2014\u201creasonable market size\u201d or \u201cjust prior to 11 a.m.\u201d\u2014also allow for subjective interpretation.  This type of judgment is not inherently a problem, but it does open the door for improper behavior and also makes transgressions more difficult to identify.\n\nAt the same time, and partly in response to the lessons learned during the financial crisis, patterns of bank funding began to shift away from unsecured funding to secured funding markets.  Investors and other market participants grew to prefer holding specific collateral against their loans\u2014even very short-term loans\u2014than just trusting in the ongoing viability of the borrower.  This shift had substantive implications for money markets and the LIBOR fixing model, which was based on the assumption that there would always be regular activity in unsecured interbank funding markets.  As those markets dried up\u2014in some cases there were essentially no transactions for longer-dated tenors\u2014it became harder for banks to ground their LIBOR submissions in actual, observable transactions.  This put a greater premium on a submitter\u2019s judgment, which increased the risk of further abuse and manipulation. \n\nWe have learned as well that compensation and hiring practices also helped to undermine the integrity of the reporting regime.  For example, we have seen that compensation and promotion within a bank are often tied to a trader\u2019s market share and profitability.  In addition, traders often move between firms so having a network of external contacts and being viewed as a team player could help to support job mobility.  Consequently, one can conclude that even the loss of a job is not necessarily a permanent setback, and that market participants with allegations of improper behavior could potentially move on to other firms with the expectation that they would generate revenue and profits for their new employer.\n\nThese incentives were amplified by the structure of the markets that underlie the setting of LIBOR and those that use LIBOR.  The interbank cash borrowing market that LIBOR references is very small relative to the enormous markets that use LIBOR, for example interest rate derivatives.  The standardization of settlement dates further concentrated trading activity.  In this type of environment, relatively small changes in LIBOR submissions\u2014either because the actual borrowing costs fluctuate or a submitting bank intentionally misreports its submissions\u2014can have substantive effects on a trader\u2019s profitability because the trader can hold large derivatives or futures positions that reference the cash LIBOR rate at the time these contracts settle.\n\nFinally, and I think perhaps most importantly, the questionable behavioral norms in the industry\u2014along with the weak control environments and compliance processes\u2014that were uncovered during the investigations, exacerbated and facilitated the misalignment of incentives that are specific to LIBOR.  It is a sad state of affairs if unethical behavior is socialized among new traders with the explanation that this is business as usual, and, if compliance and risk management are inadequate as a counterweight to prevent or identify wrong-doing.  It is untenable if people working in compliance and risk are treated as second-class citizens relative to the firms\u2019 revenue generators.\n\nThe Official Sector Response\n\nThe international regulatory community began to address these issues when the U.K. government published the Wheatley Review8 in September 2012.  The Review recommended a ten-point plan, subsequently accepted in full by the U.K. government, for comprehensive reform of LIBOR.  This led to many changes including the statutory regulation of the administration and submission process with respect to LIBOR, the selection of a new administrator for LIBOR, new governance and oversight regimes for the administrator and submission guidelines as well as a code of conduct for submitters.  The BBA, the former administrator for LIBOR, for example, eliminated publication of certain currency and tenor rates and delayed the publication of bank-specific submissions.  Perhaps most importantly, LIBOR-related activities are now subject to formal regulation and supervision in the U.K.\n\nI support the changes initiated by the U.K. government and believe they have substantially strengthened LIBOR.  That said, I also believe that more work remains to be done to broaden the definition of LIBOR so that it represents the reality of new funding patterns for banks, and to also tie submissions more closely and systematically to observable transactions.\n\nA second notable development was the publication of an international set of principles for financial benchmarks developed by the International Organization of Securities Commissions9(IOSCO) in 2013.  These principles include a set of 19 specific standards across governance, benchmark quality, methodology and accountability that have emerged as the international standard.  IOSCO has rightly focused on tying benchmarks more closely to observable, arms-length transactions.  While a pure transactions-based rate will not solve all problems for all benchmarks, this is an important step toward eliminating excessive reliance on expert judgment.\n\nAs part of the international reform efforts, the Federal Reserve played a lead role in a set of recommendations for the reform of reference interest rates produced by the Financial Stability Board (FSB).  Former Governor Jeremy Stein, followed by Governor Jay Powell, co-chaired a working group with Martin Wheatley of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).  This working group was charged with reviewing existing interest rate benchmarks, and for establishing and guiding a group of market participants to identify the feasibility and viability of adopting alternative reference rates. \n\nThe FSB report10 was released in July and Governor Powell11 has recently described the Federal Reserve\u2019s plans to support the two primary components of the reform of LIBOR.  First, we are considering, in cooperation with the LIBOR administrator and other members of the official sector, ways to broaden the definition of LIBOR to more adequately represent current patterns of bank funding and to anchor it more firmly in observable transactions.  Second, we believe it is important for market participants to have access to a range of appropriately created and governed reference rates that best suit their particular business needs.  For example, some activities such as interest rate derivatives might be better served with a risk-free or near risk-free reference rate, rather than one that embeds a bank credit risk component.\n\nI would like to emphasize three points in support of the FSB recommendations and our own efforts.  First, the FSB recommendations make clear that there is not one single path for all jurisdictions to achieve the common objective of more robust and resilient reference rates.  Rather, each jurisdiction must take into account its own specific institutional, legal and market practices and arrive at its own best solution.  In the U.S., I believe it is important to identify alternative reference rates that are grounded in a strong governance framework as laid out in the IOSCO principles and that are supported by market transactions.  This brings me to my second point\u2014given a set of robust reference rates that meet IOSCO standards, the choice among these reference rates should be left to market participants who can best identify the specific rate that is most appropriate for a specific business need.  Third, the Federal Reserve is committed to working with market participants of all kinds\u2014dealers, end users, legal and accounting experts\u2014to help develop robust reference rates that meet the needs of all types of market participants.\n\nIn addition to these specific efforts around improving and finding alternative benchmarks, the New York Fed is sponsoring other efforts related to the reform of market practices and benchmark rates.  The Foreign Exchange Committee (FXC) and Treasury Market Practices Group (TMPG), for example, are two groups of senior market practitioners sponsored by the New York Fed that are working within their markets to identify best practices for trading and behavior related to benchmark rates.  Both groups also have published broader sets of best practices for the foreign exchange markets, and for Treasury, agency debt and agency MBS markets.  I would ask all market participants to ensure that these and other best practices guide the behavior that we should expect from participants in financial markets.\n\nThis will not be easy, but I believe restoring confidence in reference rates is achievable and will greatly enhance the robustness and resilience of our financial system.  I have focused here on the reform efforts around LIBOR, which is only one reference rate, albeit one that is widely used and a core part of our financial system.  But, the need for stronger governance and more accountability spreads much further within the set of benchmark rates, and further to encompass a wide range of practices within the financial system.  For example, accusations have recently surfaced related to business practices within foreign exchange markets.  While the concerns are technically very different than the practices uncovered around LIBOR submissions, the common theme is the willingness of a small number of market participants to behave improperly and contribute to a decline in confidence in the integrity of benchmark rates specifically and of major financial institutions more generally.\n\nNext Steps\n\nI have discussed some of the observed problems in major reference rates that reflect egregious personal behavior.  Some individuals responded to poorly-designed incentives and weak controls at some of the largest financial institutions.  The regulatory community has already taken important steps to mitigate those concerns and real progress has been made.  While this has helped to restore some of the integrity of particular reference rates, such as LIBOR, more work needs to be done before confidence in these rates are put on a firmer foundation.\n\nI\u2019ll conclude by emphasizing two of the next steps that I think are most essential for the successful reform of LIBOR.  First, the definition of LIBOR should be broadened so that it more accurately reflects the observed funding patterns of large banks and puts the rate on a broader, more stable base of observable transactions.  The LIBOR administrator is actively considering ways to do this while remaining true to the spirit of LIBOR and how it is used in financial contracts.  Accomplishing this will make markets that need a reference rate that embodies bank credit risk more robust and resilient and will strengthen the financial system.\n\nSecond, we still face the problem that the reference rate for a large stock of derivatives contracts is based on a relatively small, underlying cash market.  This means there still is a powerful incentive for individuals to attempt to manipulate the rate for their own gains.  One promising solution, outlined in Governor Powell\u2019s recent speech on reference rates, is to work with market participants to find an alternative reference rate that is based on a deeper underlying cash market and that meets the needs of all market participants.  Of course, any rate that serves as a critical financial benchmark must meet the principles for good governance and production outlined by IOSCO.  \n\nThis combination\u2014a more robust and resilient LIBOR for transactions that require a reference rate with a bank credit risk component and the development of an alternative reference rate for transactions like interest rate derivatives that don\u2019t\u2014will strengthen our financial system and help undo some of the damage caused by earlier transgressions.  But this is only a necessary and not a sufficient set of conditions.  To achieve the outcome desired, financial institutions also need to have in place the appropriate incentives and controls.\n\nThank you for your attention.

It is a pleasure to reconnect with you here in Tokyo and an honor to have the opportunity to speak before this distinguished audience.\n\nCentral banks responded aggressively to the financial crisis that began in 2007 and the slow recovery that\u2019s followed, and have taken unprecedented steps in providing monetary policy accommodation in pursuit of their macroeconomic policy objectives.  In doing so, many have had to adapt in unconventional ways the frameworks and tools they use to implement their policy decisions.  My remarks today will focus on the role played by the Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in the implementation of monetary policy in the U.S., and on the evolution of our operational tools in recent years.  I will then discuss the implications of these changes for the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet and for the eventual \u201cnormalization\u201d of monetary policy when the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) believes it is appropriate to remove the extraordinary levels of monetary policy accommodation that it has provided.  Finally, I will discuss some of the considerations that must be taken into account in normalizing monetary policy.  As always, these are my views and do not necessarily reflect those of the New York Fed or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nThe Desk\u2019s Role in Implementing Monetary Policy\n\nThe Federal Reserve (the Fed) has a somewhat more complex organizational and governance structure than most other central banks around the world, so before discussing recent developments in the implementation of monetary policy, I\u2019d like to take a moment to describe roles and responsibilities within the Federal Reserve System and where the Desk fits in.\n\nThe statutory basis for U.S. monetary policy is found in the Federal Reserve Act, which was enacted just over 100 years ago.  Modern language around monetary policy objectives was added in 1977, when the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee were charged by Congress with maintaining \u201clong run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates\u2026so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.\u201d  The goals of maximum employment and price stability have come to be known as the Fed\u2019s \u201cdual mandate.\u201d\n\nFormulating policy in pursuit of that dual mandate is the province of two separate-but-related policymaking entities within the Federal Reserve System (the System)\u2014the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Board of Governors) and the FOMC (which I also refer to as \u201cthe Committee\u201d)\u2014each of which has responsibility for certain policy tools.  The FOMC is the principal body for monetary policymaking and consists of the seven members of the Board of Governors plus the presidents of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks (only five of whom are voting members in any given year).  The FOMC is responsible for the use of open market operations (OMOs), which are purchases and sales of securities in the open market for the System Open Market Account (SOMA), the Fed\u2019s securities portfolio.  OMOs are traditionally the primary tool through which monetary policy is implemented.  The Board of Governors is responsible for several complementary policy tools.  These tools pertain largely to depository institutions (DIs or \u201cbanks\u201d) and include the discount rate\u2014that is, the rate at which banks borrow from the discount window, the Fed\u2019s lending facility administered through the twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks\u2014and policies around reserves held by depository institutions at the Fed (including reserve requirements, and more recently, the payment of interest on reserve balances and term deposits).2  However, it\u2019s important to note that each of these tools is merely a means to an end, used to influence financial conditions in order to achieve the Federal Reserve\u2019s dual mandate.\n\nSince 1936, the New York Fed has been selected each year by the FOMC as the Bank within the System responsible for the execution of OMOs.  Within the New York Fed, the Desk, under the guidance of a manager of the SOMA selected by the FOMC\u2014currently me\u2014is responsible for conducting open market operations under the authorization and direction of the FOMC.3  In practice, the FOMC\u2019s operating objective for OMOs\u2014for example, a target rate for overnight interest rates or a specified amount of assets to purchase\u2014is communicated to the Desk through a policy \u201cdirective\u201d that the Committee votes on at the conclusion of each meeting.  This directive specifically instructs the Desk to conduct transactions for the SOMA in furtherance of the desired operating objective.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s Changed Operating Framework\n\nIn recent years, like many other central banks around the world in the face of the Great Recession and the prolonged economic recovery that has followed, the Fed adopted unconventional measures to provide monetary policy accommodation in pursuit of its macroeconomic policy objectives.  This is reflected in changes in the Fed\u2019s operating framework and the FOMC\u2019s operating objective for OMOs.\n\nFor many decades prior to the crisis, the operating objective for OMOs was expressed as a target for the federal funds rate\u2014an overnight, unsecured rate in the market for reserve balances.  The target rate was achieved through permanent and temporary OMOs that sought to adjust the supply of reserve balances in the banking system to a level that was expected to equal the estimated level of demand for reserve balances at the FOMC\u2019s target rate.  The Desk\u2019s permanent additions to the supply of reserve balances were designed to fall somewhat short of the total demand, creating a \u201cstructural deficiency\u201d in the supply of reserves.  The Desk then conducted daily fine-tuning operations to temporarily add reserve balances to get to the desired level.  These daily operations represented a marginal adjustment to the aggregate supply of reserves, largely in response to the exogenous impact of transitory changes in other Fed liabilities such as currency in circulation and the level of the U.S. Treasury\u2019s account balance at the Fed.\n\nMinor variations in the total level of reserves supplied could move equilibrium market rates up or down as individual depository institutions with a deficiency of reserves had to find and trade with depository institutions with a surplus of reserves.  This system functioned with a relatively low level of reserve balances.4  The Desk was able to reliably achieve the FOMC\u2019s policy directive under this implementation framework.  The effective federal funds rate\u2014the average rate prevailing in the brokered federal funds market each day\u2014routinely hit the FOMC\u2019s target rate, generating a high degree of confidence among market participants in the Desk\u2019s ability to implement policy.\n\nThis operating framework changed as the financial crisis deepened.  By December 2008, the FOMC had lowered its target for the federal funds rate from a point target of 5\u00bc percent in mid-2007 to a target range of zero to \u00bc percent.  With the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates effectively at the zero lower bound, the FOMC\u2019s operating objective for OMOs was expanded to include adjustments in the size and composition of the Federal Reserve\u2019s securities portfolio.  In particular, the FOMC initiated large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs) of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), agency debt, and later longer-term Treasury securities, in order to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help make broader financial conditions more accommodative.   The expansion of the domestic securities portfolio that resulted from LSAPs vastly increased the supply of reserve balances in the system (Figure 1).5\n\nImportantly, in October 2008, the Fed was granted authority to pay interest on depository institutions\u2019 reserve balances.6  In an environment of elevated reserve balances that resulted from the Fed\u2019s asset purchases, the payment of interest on excess reserves (IOER)\u2014currently at a rate of \u00bc percent\u2014has kept the overnight federal funds rate within its target range (Figure 2).7  Although the FOMC continues to direct the Desk to undertake OMOs as necessary to maintain conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from zero to \u00bc percent, the Desk has not needed to conduct OMOs to manage the supply of reserves since December 2008.\n\nInstead, OMOs have focused on directives to adjust the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio.  Since late 2008, the FOMC has directed the Desk to carry out three large-scale asset purchase programs and several other portfolio-oriented initiatives, such as the maturity extension program (MEP) and changes in reinvestment policies (Figure 3).  Under the MEP, commonly referred to by market participants as \u201cOperation Twist,\u201d the FOMC lengthened the maturity profile of the SOMA\u2019s portfolio of Treasury securities by offsetting purchases of longer-term Treasury securities with sales of equal par amounts of shorter-term securities and redemptions of maturing ones.8  Additionally, since mid-2010, the FOMC has directed the Desk to reinvest or roll over payments of principal on the securities holdings in the SOMA, which maintains the size of the portfolio and adjusts the asset type and maturity composition of its holdings.9\n\nLarge-Scale Asset Purchases as a Policy Tool and Their Execution\n\nOf course, as this audience knows well, the Federal Reserve was not the first major central bank to use alternative tools for monetary policy implementation at the zero lower bound.  The quantitative easing policy (QEP) that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) initiated to combat deflation in 2001, after operating for some time under a policy of zero interest rates, provided a valuable precedent when central bankers elsewhere faced similar challenges later that decade.  However, the balance sheet expansion under the BoJ\u2019s original quantitative easing differed significantly from the asset purchase programs undertaken by advanced economy central banks over recent years, including the BoJ\u2019s current quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE).  The earlier QEP was a liability-driven program in which the BoJ changed its operating objective from an overnight interest rate to quantitative targets for the level of current account balances outstanding at the BoJ (the counterpart to reserve balances held by depository institutions at the Fed).  To achieve its new target, the BoJ provided ample liquidity through a range of operations.  Although the BoJ increased its outright purchases of long-term government bonds as part of this initiative, a large share of the easing was accomplished through temporary open market operations or purchases of short-term securities.  In contrast, the FOMC\u2019s portfolio-oriented programs have been driven by a desire to expand and lengthen the maturity structure of the asset side of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet in order to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates.  The accompanying growth of reserve balances has been a byproduct of those purchases, not a specified objective.  Former Fed Chairman Bernanke referred to this approach as \u201ccredit easing,\u201d in contrast to the BoJ\u2019s \u201cquantitative easing.\u201d10\n\nThe FOMC\u2019s different objective for OMOs reflects the primary transmission channel through which LSAPs are understood to affect financial and economic conditions.  Central bank purchases of longer-term bonds reduce the stock of such securities held by private investors.  Accordingly, the purchases remove duration risk\u2014and in the case of agency MBS, prepayment risk\u2014from the private sector, which drives term and other risk premiums on those assets lower than they would otherwise be.11  This re-pricing of risk ultimately puts downward pressure on long-term interest rates, an effect that spreads to other assets as some investors rebalance their portfolios.  The term premium effect of the Fed\u2019s purchases should continue to influence financial conditions as long as the assets remain in the SOMA portfolio, although the size of the effect will diminish over time as the risk associated with the portfolio diminishes.  Some standard portfolio risk measures illustrate the degree to which the Federal Reserve has absorbed extra duration risk onto its balance sheet.  The SOMA Treasury portfolio currently has an average duration of about 7.5 years, compared with a pre-crisis level of about 2.6 years.  Meanwhile, the duration risk of the entire domestic securities portfolio, including agency MBS and agency debt as well as Treasury securities, is equivalent to about $2.9 trillion in 10-year Treasury securities (Figure 4).  Purchases likely also work through a signaling effect, to the extent that they are perceived as a credible signal of the central bank\u2019s intentions regarding the future level of short-term interest rates.  And in circumstances when market functioning is unusually strained, as was the case prior to the Fed\u2019s first LSAP program, asset purchases may enhance liquidity through the central bank\u2019s consistent and significant presence in the market.\n\nOver the past six years, the FOMC has been flexible in using these tools, adapting as it learned and as individual circumstances changed.  In the first two LSAP programs and MEP, for example, the FOMC communicated an expected total size and completion date for each program.  However, the third (and current) LSAP program has been outcome-based, with the FOMC announcing only a monthly pace and composition for its purchases and noting that purchases would continue until there is a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability.  Other central banks have also used conditional asset purchases effectively.  Perhaps the best example is the Outright Monetary Transactions program announced by the European Central Bank (ECB) in September 2012.  This program is credited with helping to stabilize euro-area fixed income markets by ruling out certain bad equilibria.  This success was achieved without the purchase of a single asset.  Another example of conditional asset purchases is the BoJ\u2019s statement of a commitment to continue QEP until inflation registered stably at or above zero.\n\nChanges in the Fed\u2019s Balance Sheet and Implications for Normalization\n\nSo where are we now?  The current purchase program appears to be nearing its completion.  Last week, the FOMC directed the Desk to reduce purchases of Treasury securities to $10 billion per month and purchases of agency MBS to $5 billion per month starting in October.  The Committee also indicated that it will end the current purchase program at its next meeting if incoming information broadly supports its expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective.  It also directed the Desk to maintain its agency MBS and Treasury security reinvestment policies\u2014activities it separately announced it expects to continue after it begins to increase its target range for the federal funds rate.\n\nShould this course come to pass, the domestic securities portfolio will peak at a par value of about $4.2 trillion\u2014more than a five-fold increase since the start of the financial crisis in August 2007.  The composition of the portfolio will also remain more complex.  Formerly composed entirely of Treasury securities, the domestic portfolio is now only 60 percent Treasury securities, with the remainder held in agency MBS (and a small amount of agency debt securities).  As I noted earlier, the weighted average maturity of the Treasury portfolio has lengthened substantially, while the MEP essentially eliminated the portfolio\u2019s holdings of any Treasury securities maturing prior to February 2016.  Meanwhile, it\u2019s hard to predict the exact pace at which the SOMA portfolio\u2019s agency MBS holdings will pay down over time given the prepayment uncertainty associated with those securities.\n\nAt last week\u2019s meeting, the FOMC also reaffirmed its view that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current zero to \u00bc percent target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee\u2019s 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.  Meanwhile, as a matter of prudent planning, the Committee has been deliberating how it should proceed to remove policy accommodation (often called \u201cnormalization\u201d), when it believes the appropriate time to do so comes.  Although the specific timing of this is not yet known, it\u2019s certain that the level of reserve balances in the banking system will be very high.  Assuming no other liabilities are issued, there would be about $2.9 trillion in reserves\u2014mostly in excess reserves\u2014if the Committee ends asset purchases next month and continues reinvestments.  In itself, an elevated level of reserve balances need not impede the FOMC\u2019s ability to effectively raise the level of short-term interest rates because of the ability to pay interest on excess reserves.\n\nFollowing last week\u2019s FOMC meeting, the Committee released a revised set of normalization principles and plans (taking into account changes in the SOMA portfolio and enhancements in available tools since it originally issued such principles in June 2011) that it intends to implement when it becomes appropriate to begin normalizing the stance of monetary policy.  Importantly, as the Chair noted during her post-meeting press conference, this statement is intended to provide information to the public about the eventual normalization process; it does not signal a change in the current or future stance of monetary policy.\n\nAccording to the principles, the Committee will adjust the level of monetary accommodation primarily by utilizing policy tools to influence the level of short-term interest rates\u2014in the first instance, using tools with rates directly administered by the Fed.  Tools that can immobilize or drain large levels of reserves to tighten control over the federal funds rate also remain available.  However, the principles do not envision that active adjustments to the SOMA portfolio will play a featured role.\n\nSpecifically, the FOMC indicated that the federal funds rate will continue to play a central role in the Fed\u2019s operating framework and communications during normalization, and that it will raise the target range for the federal funds rate when economic conditions warrant a less accommodative monetary policy stance.  Adjustments in the interest rate that the Fed pays to depository institutions on excess reserve balances\u2014that is, the IOER rate\u2014will be the primary tool to move the federal funds rate into the target range.  Raising the IOER rate should put upward pressure on a range of market interest rates and influence overall financial conditions in a way that fosters the Federal Reserve\u2019s macroeconomic objectives. \n\nThe Committee also indicated that an overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility and other supplementary tools will be used, as needed, to help control the level of the federal funds rate.  An ON RRP facility will supplement the primary role of IOER in controlling the federal funds rate by providing an alternative safe, overnight asset for money market investors.  I will describe the role of the ON RRP facility in more detail in a moment.12\n\nThe Committee expects to gradually return the balance sheet to a more normal size and composition, primarily by ceasing to reinvest repayments of principal.  A halt or reduction in reinvestments is expected to occur after the FOMC begins increasing the target range for the federal funds rate.  The FOMC does not plan to use asset sales as part of the normalization process, but suggests that limited sales might be warranted in the longer run to reduce or eliminate residual agency MBS holdings.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will continue to test some of these tools to gather additional information about their efficacy and to enhance their operational readiness prior to liftoff.  For the past year, the Desk has been conducting an exercise of ON RRP operations.  Conducting ON RRPs for same-day settlement with a broad range of counterparties\u2014including primary dealers, money funds, government-sponsored enterprises, and banks\u2014allows the Federal Reserve to provide a safe, liquid investment to a wider range of money market participants than those able to earn IOER, and thus expands the universe of counterparties that should generally be unwilling to lend at rates below those available through the Federal Reserve.  The increased competition that the availability of this instrument provides should help to firm the floor on the level of short-term interest rates\u2014that is, the rate beneath which market participants should theoretically be unwilling to lend funds.  Indeed, ON RRP exercise results over the first year suggest that the operations have been successful working with IOER in establishing a floor on the level of key money market rates (Figure 5).\n\nAll of the Desk\u2019s eligible counterparty types participate in the ON RRPs, with money funds accounting for the largest share of take-up (Figure 6).  Take-up at the operations generally increases when the spread between market rates and the ON RRP offered rate narrows.  Take-up also rises substantially around quarter- and year-end financial reporting dates, when some money market participants\u2019 access to other overnight secured investments is more limited.  The increase in take-up on these dates is especially large for prime money market funds (Figure 7).   In addition to patterns of usage of the ON RRPs themselves, we also analyze trading patterns and interest rate dynamics in secured and unsecured funding markets.  In doing so, we use a wide range of data, including transactions data for unsecured funding markets obtained through a new Federal Reserve collection effort (FR 2420).\n\nWhile ON RRPs are a powerful tool for policy implementation, FOMC and market participants have noted the potential for very large regular usage to alter patterns of financial intermediation or, in a fixed-rate structure with no take-up limits, to exacerbate liquidity pressures during times of stress.  To further examine how ON RRPs might best be structured to supplement IOER in the control of the federal funds rate while limiting the potential for unintended effects in financial markets, the FOMC has directed the Desk to test several changes to the design of its ON RRP operations.  As of Monday, the per-counterparty maximum bid limit was raised from $10 billion to $30 billion, and an overall size limit of $300 billion was imposed for each operation.  If the total amount of bids received in an operation is less than or equal to the $300 billion size limit, awards will be made at a fixed offering rate.  However, if the total amount of bids received exceeds the overall operation size limit, the $300 billion in ON RRPs will be allocated through a single-price auction using interest rates that counterparties now include with their bids.  Awards are made at a \u201cstopout rate\u201d\u2014the rate at which the overall size limit is achieved\u2014with all bids below this rate awarded in full and all bids at this rate awarded on a pro rata basis.  The stopout rate is determined by evaluating all bids in ascending order by submitted rate up to the point at which the total quantity of offers equals the overall size limit.13  The Federal Reserve will be closely analyzing the results of the ON RRP exercise conducted under these new testing parameters in order to further its understanding of how an ON RRP facility might best be structured during the initial stages of the normalization process.\n\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve Board has been testing a facility through which it offers term deposits to credentialed depository institutions.  Term Deposit Facility (TDF) transactions could be used to temporarily reduce the quantity of reserve balances.  An eight-week series of tests this summer explored how demand for term deposits responds to variations in the maximum award limits and rates.  Higher offered rates attracted greater use, both in terms of the number of participants and the total dollar volume demanded.  Demand for the TDF may have been tempered somewhat by the instruments\u2019 lack of an early-withdrawal feature, and thus the inability to consider them as high-quality liquid assets for regulatory purposes.  The next round of TDF testing, which will commence in October, will incorporate an early withdrawal feature, as well as gradually increase the maximum award amount and rate.\n\nA Broader Perspective on Normalization\n\nI\u2019ve discussed how the FOMC\u2019s eventual approach to removing monetary policy accommodation reflects developments in the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet since the onset of the financial crisis.  As noted earlier, the relatively long maturity structure of the SOMA portfolio means that the level of reserve balances in the U.S. banking system will decline only slowly through passive means, absent any asset sales.  Other central banks that have undertaken unconventional measures also face (or will eventually face) similar challenges when they deem it appropriate to begin their own policy normalizations.\n\nThe Bank of England (BoE) and the Bank of Japan are two relevant examples that come immediately to mind.  The BoE\u2019s Asset Purchase Facility, through which its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) purchased \u00a3375 billion of longer-term assets between 2009 and 2012, was quite comparable in purpose and design to the Fed\u2019s LSAP programs.  Moreover, since March 2013, the BoE has reinvested the cash flows associated with maturing gilts in the facility in order to maintain the stock of securities at a steady level.  In its February 2014 Inflation Report, the MPC provided guidance on its expected normalization framework, laying out an approach in which its Bank Rate\u2014the deposit rate for central bank reserves in the U.K.\u2014is the active marginal instrument for monetary policy while portfolio-related tools, including reinvestments and asset sales, receive less emphasis.  Specifically, the MPC suggested that it intends to maintain its stock of purchased assets, including reinvesting the cash flows associated with maturing securities, at least until it raises its target short-term interest rate from its current level.  Meanwhile, the BoJ is still purchasing assets under QQE, which it launched in April 2013.  With a goal of increasing its Japanese government bond (JGB) holdings by \u00a550 trillion per year, it has not yet initiated a discussion of eventual normalization.  When that time comes, however, the BoJ will be holding a large portfolio of longer-term JGBs.  The BoJ\u2019s balance sheet will therefore look markedly different than it did when the QEP ended in 2006, at which time the BoJ just allowed short-term funds-supplying operations to roll off.  The portfolio size and composition to which each central bank eventually normalizes will, of course, depend on what it eventually determines is appropriate to support implementation of monetary policy in the longer run.  Indeed, the FOMC has indicated that in the longer run, it will hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively, and that it will hold primarily Treasury securities.\n\nThe ECB has also used unconventional measures to provide accommodation, but unlike the Federal Reserve, BoJ, and BoE, this has primarily been through liquidity provided directly to the banking system via longer-term refinancing operations, rather than through asset purchases.  This liquidity was provided at fixed terms of up to three years, thus allowing the size of the ECB\u2019s balance sheet to normalize automatically as refinancing agreements mature.  By contrast, the ECB\u2019s upcoming purchases of asset-backed securities and covered bonds will present it with longer-term portfolio considerations. \n\nFinally, I should note that central banks\u2014like other financial market participants\u2014need to remain aware of changes in the financial market landscapes in which they operate.  They may need to adapt their operations accordingly as they move away from asset purchases and back to money market instruments to implement monetary policy.  For example, in addition to reflecting developments in its balance sheet since the financial crisis, the FOMC\u2019s approach to normalizing policy also reflects changes in U.S. money market dynamics that have been influenced by various factors.  These factors include the extraordinary level of liquidity that\u2019s been provided, access to IOER that is limited to depository institutions, and a number of international and domestic regulatory reforms.  International regulatory reforms include the liquidity coverage ratio, leverage ratio, and net stable funding ratio.  In the U.S., changes in deposit insurance premium calculations, rules governing money market mutual funds, and the potential for a capital surcharge based in part on short-term wholesale funding may also affect certain market participants.  Many of the changes in regulation\u2014along with changes in market structure, technology, and other factors\u2014may affect market participants\u2019 activity and relationships in money markets.  On net, their balance sheet costs may be higher, which may prompt money market participants to require higher returns to engage in competition to arbitrage wedges in money market rates and to alter their participation in central bank operations and facilities.  This outcome may affect the transmission of monetary policy or require central banks to adapt their operations to accommodate these realities.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, I\u2019d like to note that the framework for implementing monetary policy and the landscape in which we operate have seen important changes in the years since the crisis, and they continue to evolve.  The Desk plays an important role in this process, carrying out open market operations at the direction of the FOMC, in pursuit of the operating objectives the FOMC deems appropriate to achieve its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.  The operating tools that the Federal Reserve has developed will allow us to tighten monetary policy when the FOMC determines it is appropriate to do so, but I have no doubt that we will continue to learn more about how these tools interact as we normalize policy and make adjustments over time, just as we have done in the past.  We will also learn from and share our experiences with other central banks that are undergoing similar transitions.\n\nThank you.\n\n1 I would like to thank Deborah Leonard and Matthew Raskin for their excellent assistance in the preparation of these remarks and colleagues in the Federal Reserve System for numerous insightful comments and suggestions.\n\n2 The Board of Governors is also responsible for the supervision and regulation of banks and systemically important financial institutions, payments systems and infrastructure, and overall oversight of the Federal Reserve System.  It may also authorize Federal Reserve Banks to extend credit to other entities under emergency lending authority. \n\n3 The FOMC\u2019s Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations and Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations outline the activities that the selected Bank is eligible to undertake.  The domestic policy directive and foreign currency directive specifically instruct the Desk to execute such operations in furtherance of a particular operating objective defined by the FOMC.\n\n4 In the five years prior to the crisis, total reserve balances averaged $20 billion and excess reserves\u2014balances in excess of those required to satisfy reserve balance requirements \u2014averaged about $1.5 billion.\n\n5 These asset purchases followed various programs the Fed initiated during the crisis to support the liquidity of financial institutions and foster improved conditions in financial markets. Credit extension through these crisis-related programs was temporary in nature, so the impact of these programs on reserve balances was unwound as the loans were repaid.  In contrast, reserve expansion associated with LSAPs has a more enduring effect as long as the assets remain in the SOMA portfolio, subject to offsetting influences on reserves from changes in other balance sheet items.\n\n6 The authority for the Federal Reserve to pay interest on reserve balances held by depository institutions was granted by Congress prior to the crisis, in the Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006, with a planned effective date of October 2011.  However, implementation was accelerated as part of the response to the financial crisis.  The statute authorizes Federal Reserve Banks to pay interest on balances maintained to satisfy reserve balance requirements (required reserves) and on excess balances (excess reserves).\n\n7 As noted earlier, the Board of Governors is responsible for setting the rate of interest on reserves.  Since December 16, 2008, the interest rates on required reserve balances and excess reserve balances have both been \u00bc percent, but the rates need not be the same.  Although the interest rate on reserves represents an overnight rate, it is calculated and paid out on a lagged basis according to two-week reserves management maintenance periods.  The payment is based on daily account balances and a weighted average of applicable overnight rates over the maintenance period.  More information can be found in Regulation D.\n\n8 The MEP provided additional monetary policy accommodation by increasing the duration of the SOMA portfolio, but unlike LSAP programs, on net it had a neutral effect on the level of reserves.\n\n9 From mid-August 2010 through September 2011, principal payments from holdings of agency debt and agency MBS were reinvested in longer-term Treasury securities.  Since October 2011, they have been reinvested in agency MBS.\n\n10 Ben S. Bernanke, \u201cThe Crisis and the Policy Response,\u201d Stamp Lecture, London School of Economics, London, England, January 13, 2009.\n\n11 A security\u2019s duration captures the weighted average term to maturity of the security\u2019s cash flows and provides a measure of the sensitivity of the security\u2019s price to changes in interest rates.  Duration (and therefore price risk) is generally greater for longer-maturity and lower-coupon securities.  Agency MBS prices additionally carry prepayment risk, the risk associated with the uncertainty around the timing of principal cash flows owing to the fact that homeowners have the option to prepay their mortgages at any time.  Because of this embedded option, agency MBS cash flows vary as interest rates change.\n\n12 A reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo, or RRP) is a type of temporary OMO in which the Desk sells a security from the SOMA portfolio to an eligible counterparty with an agreement to repurchase that security at a specified price at a specific time in the future.  It is economically equivalent to a collateralized investment with the Fed in which the difference between the sale price and the repurchase price, adjusted for the time between transaction legs, implies a rate of interest paid by the Fed on the cash invested by the counterparty.\n\n13 For more details about ON RRP operations, please see FAQs on the New York Fed\u2019s website."

    "title": "Welcoming Remarks at Workshop on the Risks of Wholesale Funding",
    "date": "Aug 13, 2014",
    "speaker": "Unknown",

    "content": "It is a pleasure to welcome you to the New York Fed today to discuss the important issue of wholesale funding.1\n\nAs you all know, the financial system plays an essential role in modern economies, and liquidity is in turn critical to the functioning of the financial system. Because financial intermediation is critical to economic activity and intermediation is dependent on funding and liquidity, disruption to funding and liquidity can cause severe damage to the economy. The experience of recent years revealed serious flaws in the system. Risk was mispriced and there was a build-up of excesses before the crisis. Structural weaknesses in the financial system then amplified the effect of the sharp decline in U.S. house prices, and the result was a widespread financial crisis and a deep recession both here and abroad.\n\nThe extensive use by financial firms of short-term wholesale funding was one critical factor in the crisis. Not only did this reliance on short-term funding create the potential for a firm to fail in an extraordinarily rapid manner when faced with a loss of market confidence, but it also served as a channel through which the effects of those failures were widely propagated throughout the broader financial system. \n\nI will focus my brief remarks on describing the structural vulnerabilities associated with short-term wholesale funding, laying the groundwork for our discussions at today's workshop.\n\nAs always, my remarks reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System. \n\nAs this audience knows, in the two decades leading up to the financial crisis, the global financial system underwent a rapid transformation. During this period, there was a shift from bank-based financial intermediation to capital markets-based financial intermediation, and an increase in the scale and complexity of securitization activities.\n\nIn the pre-crisis period, the growth of securitization was accompanied by an increasing reliance on short-term funds raised in wholesale markets to finance securities and activities essential to securitization. This ranged from the use of repo funding to finance inventories of securities held for market-making purposes to the issuance of asset-backed commercial paper by conduits created to acquire and hold securities.\n\nBoth demand and supply factors drove the increased use of short-term wholesale finance. On the supply side, the growth of savings from corporations and institutional investors in need of deposit-like products in which to place their cash balances created a plentiful source of funds.  These products were viewed as \"safe\" since, after all, the funds were only exposed for a short period of time, and in the case of repo, they were secured by collateral. On the demand side, setting aside any possible instabilities in this funding source, it was more profitable to use shorter-term funds to finance longer-term assets.\n\nIn fact, the growing reliance on short-term wholesale funding to finance longer-term assets increased liquidity and maturity mismatch risk in the financial system. This was particularly dangerous because many of the assets being financed were structured-credit products, some of which were opaque, difficult to value and illiquid. In periods of market stress, these features increase the run risk by funding providers.\n\nShort-term funding of longer-term assets is inherently unstable, especially in the presence of information and coordination problems.  It can be rational for a funding provider to supply funds on a short-term basis, reasoning that it can exit if there is any uncertainty over the firm's continued ability to roll over its funding from other sources. But, if the use of short-term funding becomes sufficiently widespread, the firm's roll-over risk increases. In this situation, there is a strong incentive for each lender to \"run\" early if there is any uncertainty that could undermine the borrower's ability to continue to roll over its funding from other sources. This is the case even if the provider of funds believes that the borrower would remain solvent as long as it retained access to funding on normal terms. The cost of running when it turns out to be unnecessary is small relative to the cost of not running when it turns out to be prudent.\n\nOf course, this insight is not a new one. Prior to the establishment of a lender of last resort and retail deposit insurance for banks\u2014which came with the quid pro quo of prudential regulation\u2014bank runs were a regular and disruptive feature of our financial system. These innovations solved the coordination problem and stabilized this source of funding.\n\nWhat was new prior to the crisis was the extent to which maturity transformation and financial intermediation had migrated outside of commercial banks. The growth of what we call the shadow banking system occurred largely without the types of safeguards\u2014robust prudential regulation, deposit insurance, lender of last resort\u2014that have safeguarded the commercial banking system from the types of widespread panics and runs that are capable of destabilizing the financial system. The systemic risk created by this gap in coverage was not well recognized by regulators or the private sector prior to the global financial crisis. Market participants had little incentive to internalize the negative externality of the run-risk created by their collective choice of finance, and they made erroneous assumptions about the liquidity of asset markets and the capacity and willingness of banks to distribute central bank liquidity to the wider financial system during periods of stress. \n\nBecause the boom years resulted in strong earnings, low price volatility and few credit losses, firms were able to operate at extreme levels of leverage. When housing prices started to decline, the vulnerabilities of this type of business model soon became apparent.\n\nHeavy reliance on short-term wholesale funding exposed the system to a series of intertwined downward spirals in asset and funding markets. This spread in waves. It began in the market for asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) issued by off-balance-sheet conduits, and spread via auction-rate securities to the repo, money market and financial commercial paper markets that formed the core financing for market-based financial intermediation.\n\nInitial declines in asset prices especially for mortgage related assets forced leveraged holders with maturity mismatches to sell assets. This increased price volatility and further reduced the value of the assets that collateralized other firms' borrowings. Higher volatility led banks and secured lenders to raise margins, while concern about counterparty risk and their own funding needs made banks reluctant to on-lend liquidity. \n\nThe resulting higher margins on repo and increased collateral calls due to credit ratings downgrades reduced the quantity of assets that could be financed in repo markets and elsewhere, prompting further asset sales. As wholesale investors started to exit, this set in motion a bad dynamic\u2014a fire sale of assets that cut into earnings and capital. This increased the incentives of investors to run and for banks to hoard liquidity against the risk that they could themselves face a run. This downward spiral of fire sales and funding runs was a key feature of the financial crisis.\n\nThe inherent fragility of short-term wholesale funding was greatly aggravated by certain institutional shortcomings in these markets, particularly in the structure of the tri-party repo system and the U.S. money market mutual fund business. \n\nThrough the tri-party repo market, each day the two large clearing banks were providing a large amount of intraday credit to securities firms to facilitate the daily \"unwind\" of the prior day's transactions. In the run-up to the crisis, the daily \"unwind\" helped make tri-party repo look like a very liquid investment while still being an apparently highly durable source of funding. This masked the underlying risks and contributed to weak risk management practices.\n\nAs the concerns about the U.S. housing market escalated in 2007, participants in the tri-party repo market became increasingly concerned about the liquidity and credit risks that they faced. The clearing banks became uncomfortable with their large intraday exposures to their clients\u2014broker-dealers, thrifts and others. If the risk that a client might fail became too high, a clearing bank could decide not to unwind that client's trades in the morning, leaving its investors with the collateral. Most of these investors lacked the operational or financial capacity to take possession of collateral and liquidate it in a gradual manner to recoup their investment; they had a strong incentive to run at the first sign of trouble to avoid getting stuck with the dealer's collateral. Alternatively, if a client were to fail suddenly after the mornings unwind, then the clearing bank would be stuck with huge loans to these counterparties that could have put their own viability at risk, backed by securities that were not necessarily high quality and liquid. \n\nThe \"breaking the buck\" by the Reserve Fund following the Lehman bankruptcy also made it clear that the monies provided to the money market mutual funds by their own investors were also inherently unstable. This made such funds, in turn, an unreliable source of finance in repo, commercial paper and other markets. Investors in a fixed net asset value (NAV) money market fund could take their money out on a daily basis at par value, with no redemption penalty. This could occur even if the money market fund did not have sufficient cash or liquid assets that it could easily sell to meet all potential redemptions. As with bank deposits prior to deposit insurance, this created an incentive for investors to be the first to get out whenever there was any uncertainty over the underlying value of the assets in the fund. By being first in line, they could exit while the fund could still repay at par, leaving others to bear any losses. The longer the investor waited, the greater the risk that the fund would be forced into the fire sale of assets to meet redemptions and end up breaking the buck.\n\nAs the crisis unfolded, the Federal Reserve, the U.S.  Treasury and others took a series of actions to contain the spiral of funding runs and asset fire sales. First, the traditional lender of last resort function was strengthened through the introduction of the Term Auction Facility (TAF) and foreign exchange swaps with foreign central banks.\n\nThen, as the crisis intensified, the lender of last resort liquidity provision was extended to directly backstop key wholesale funding markets and made available to certain nonbank firms. The Federal Reserve created a direct backstop to the tri-party repo system through the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF). When the Reserve Fund broke the buck after the failure of Lehman Brothers, precipitating a run on money market mutual funds, the Treasury guaranteed money market fund assets and the Fed introduced the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Fund Liquidation Facility (AMLF).  The Fed also backstopped the commercial paper market (formerly funded in large part by money market mutual funds) by introducing the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF). When wholesale funding for non-residential mortgage securitizations evaporated, the Fed rolled out the Term Asset-Backed Lending Facility (TALF). \n\nThese actions ultimately stabilized funding markets and crowded back in private funds. But, they were an emergency response, not a sustainable long-term solution. After all, because most of the special Fed liquidity facilities were authorized under Section 13.3 of the Federal Reserve Act, they were required to be temporary in nature and to end when times were no longer \"unusual and exigent.\"\n\nMuch has been done over the past few years to mitigate the structural flaws that make wholesale funding a point of weakness in the global financial system. The New York Fed, for example, has led a Federal Reserve effort to make the tri-party repo system more resilient to stress, while the SEC has taken steps to address risks associated with money market mutual funds.  Nonetheless, some important issues and vulnerabilities remain. Moreover, because the Dodd-Frank Act raised the hurdle for the Federal Reserve to exercise its Section 13.3 emergency lending authority, extraordinary interventions will be more difficult to undertake, perhaps causing investors to be even more skittish in the future. This is why it is essential to make the system more stable. To that end, I look forward to hearing the insights and suggestions that come out of today's workshop.\n\nThank you for your attention."

    "date": "Jul 24, 2014",
    "speaker": "Unknown",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2014/bax072314",
    "content": "Let me begin by thanking the Risk Management Association, PWC, Debevoise & Plimpton, and my friend Paul Lee for inviting me to participate in this conference.  Of course, I need to give what sometimes sounds like a Miranda warning\u2014my remarks are personal, and do not represent an official position of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or any part of the Federal Reserve System.1 There is nothing I will say that can be used against them.\n\nI am going to address three specific compliance problems: economic sanctions, tax evasion, and foreign corrupt practices.  I will use these three compliance problems to illustrate a larger point about organizational culture.  If organizational values do not support the rules that organizations use to guide the behavior of employees, and worse, if organizational values actually conflict with those rules, the organization is headed for troubled territory.  In my remaining time, I will elaborate on this fundamental point.\n\nLet me start with economic sanctions.  We have the recent case against BNPP for its conduct in evading U.S. sanctions related to Iran, Sudan and Cuba.  The case is noteworthy because the disposition involved pleas to Federal and state criminal violations, and a record fine of nearly $9 billion.  The BNPP case is not the only case against a financial institution for economic sanctions violations.  There have been a series of others.  Every one of this series of cases concerns a foreign bank.  Observers ask, \u201cwhy are all of these economic sanctions cases against foreign banks?\u201d\n\nBefore offering my answer, let me start with some \u201cnot\u2019s\u201d.  In my view, it is not that U.S. financial institutions are so much more compliant than foreign institutions.  I will avoid an ugly name-and-shame ritual, where I would identify the U.S. financial institutions that violated U.S. law.  It is not that U.S. prosecutors are xenophobic individuals who are bound and determined to target only foreign institutions.  I know from personal knowledge that prosecutors have followed the evidence and it has led them to the doors of foreign banks only. \n\nWhat explains this phenomenon?  Some foreign institutions, unlike their American counterparts, did not see the values that motivate and support U.S. economic sanctions rules.  At most U.S. financial institutions, and I may be myopic in seeing too much nobility in them, there is a widely accepted understanding that our U.S. sanctions are tailored to accomplish a laudable public purpose.  The Sudanese sanctions are designed to coerce a regime to cease certain horrific practices, like genocide.  The Iranian sanctions are designed to stifle the Iranian regime\u2019s nuclear ambitions.  The Cuban sanctions are intended to hinder the advancement of communism in the Americas and to change an oppressive regime through a trade embargo.  For U.S. financial institutions, which operate on the basis of a public charter issued in the United States, the public purposes supporting economic sanctions and the detailed sanctions regulations are in harmony.  With respect to rule compliance, the staff will follow those rules not simply because they are required to but also because they want to.\n\nWhile I am not here to speak for foreign institutions that have committed sanctions evasion, including BNPP, my sense from the evidence is that these institutions looked at economic sanctions very differently.  They looked at economic sanctions as technical \u201cAmerican\u201d rules that were not seen as consistent with the organization\u2019s and the home country\u2019s larger value system.  In Europe, they found no similar sanctions, and there it was perfectly legal at the time to do business with these sanctioned jurisdictions.  Some European bankers almost naturally adopted the view that there was no value system underlying the technical American legal rule.  The foreign institutions saw the situation as providing financial services to just another country; not to a country committing genocide; not to a country building a nuclear weapon; and not to a country fostering a dehumanizing ideology. \n\nThis failure to correlate the rule with the value is the root of real mischief.  It erodes what some commentators call the \u201cculture of compliance\u201d, and it tends to foster an employee population that will be inclined to look for loopholes, to place toes on the edge of the permissible, or even to turn a blind eye to a black letter compliance rule.  And, the organization\u2019s compliance staff will also suffer from a stifled motivation and the absence of any meaningful authority\u2014it relegates that staff to a bunch of box checkers, rather than people working toward a safer and better world.  Is it a surprise then that foreign institutions have problems with sanctions compliance and U.S. institutions do not?  I do not excuse this in any way, but I do understand it.\n\nLet us now turn to tax evasion.  On May 19, Credit Suisse pled guilty to conspiring to help certain Americans evade their tax obligations to the Federal government.  Credit Suisse agreed to pay a fine of $1.8 billion.  Like the criminal disposition concerning BNPP, this was headline news.  Credit Suisse had well developed compliance rules addressing what relationship managers could and could not do when travelling into, and through, the United States.  But those compliance rules, while cogent, were largely ignored by certain Credit Suisse personnel.  Why is that?  Here, again, I believe that the answer lies in the organizational value system. \n\nCredit Suisse was not alone in aiding customers to evade taxes.  UBS had similar problems although it escaped without a plea to a Federal felony.  Would it come as a surprise to anyone in this room that some of the Swiss cantonal banks may also have \u201cissues\u201d with respect to U.S. tax compliance?  Switzerland, the home country to the two big Swiss banks and the jurisdiction that charters them, does not have a law that criminalizes tax evasion, meaning the willful failure to report income and to pay the tax due on that income.  This may be one of the reasons why Switzerland has earned a reputation as a tax haven, although that reputation may be changing as Switzerland faces external pressure from the international community.\n\nSo, is it surprising that personnel from Switzerland, working for an organization that for many years had a business strategy of taking funds from high net worth customers without many questions about taxation at the source, did not turn square corners when visiting New York?  Does it shock you that they would meet with U.S. customers and discuss their accounts, even though that was prohibited by the rules imposed by compliance?  Once again, when the rules are in conflict with an organizational value system, watch out!  People will find a way around them, either by closing their eyes or by whispering in the darkness. \n\nFinally, let me turn to foreign corrupt practices.  I have selected this topic because official corruption is a problem that some U.S. financial institutions have found challenging during the last year.  And, in my view, there are certain features of U.S. law that might give rise to conflict between organizational values and FCPA compliance. \n\nThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act was enacted in 1977, and it represents a Congressional response to revelations of widespread bribery of foreign officials by U.S. companies.  One purpose of this legislation is stopping official corruption.  Then, and continuing to the present time, the United States led the world in enacting laws designed to stop official corruption, and perhaps more importantly, in enforcing these laws.  Let me say that, as an American lawyer who spends significant time outside the United States, this is a part of our legal infrastructure that I take pride in. \n\nWith all of that said, there is one part of the FCPA that makes me uncomfortable.  The FCPA\u2019s bribery prohibition, and the compliance officers in the audience will know this well, contains a narrow exception for \u201cfacilitating or expediting payments\u201d made in furtherance of routine governmental action.  Some of the cynical among you might know this provision as permitting so-called \u201cgrease\u201d payments for non-discretionary acts, like processing visas or providing phone service.  But, let us face it, this statutory exception permits a certain limited form of governmental corruption.  While I understand that the exception is grounded in a practical reality, I feel that zero tolerance for official corruption would have been a better choice.  To any public servant with an extended hand, I would say in a loud and clear voice, \u201cpull it back and do your job.\u201d  And, let me note the OECD Working Group on Bribery recommends that all countries encourage companies to prohibit or discourage facilitating payments.\n\nThe real mischief is what this exception might do to an organizational value system.  When an organizational policy allows some types of official corruption (and we have come up with candy coated names for this, like facilitation or expediting payments), this diminishes the efficacy of compliance rules that are directed toward stopping official corruption.  Again, the best compliance cultures are formed when the rules and the organizational value system are in perfect harmony.  So, for U.S. chartered institutions, perhaps this is a place where your organizational value system should go beyond black-letter U.S. law.  If you tolerate a little corruption, watch out!\n\nSo, I have used three compliance topics\u2014economic sanctions, tax evasion, and foreign corrupt practices\u2014to make the case for harmonizing organizational value systems and compliance rules.  At an absolute minimum, do whatever is practicable to assure that your value systems and compliance rules do not conflict or send irreconcilable messages.  In the \u201cNew Compliance Landscape\u201d, a failure to do this is a recipe for disaster. \n\nI also would like to make a concluding remark.  I do not subscribe to the view that compliance officers or legal counsel should take on the mantle of the missionary.  I am of the \u201cold school\u201d\u2014the duties of the management and the board are owed to the company and to the shareholders.  I do believe that the best among chief legal officers will see the job as more than just dispensing legal advice, and, as being the \u201cguardian of the corporation\u2019s integrity\u201d.2   But being the guardian of the corporation\u2019s integrity cannot mean that integrity is defined by the chief legal officer\u2019s personal value system and not the organization\u2019s value system.  We are not priests or rabbis. \n\nIn a world where the consequence of rule breaking can lead to fines in the multiple of billions of dollars, lawyers and compliance officers can accurately claim that, in guarding the corporation\u2019s integrity, they are enhancing shareholder value.  When the BNPP case was announced, FBI Director James Comey said:  \u201cUntil shareholders demand from their boards that those boards choose leaders who understand what it means to create a healthy culture of compliance, the money will keep walking out the door . . . .\u201d3 \n\nMy remarks today have focused on the organizational value system as distinct from its rule set.  Organizations should adopt and nurture organizational value systems because they are healthy for the company and its shareholders.  The personnel in the organization will feel better about the work that they do, and they will do better work and more of it.  It is good business to refuse to finance a jurisdiction that is sponsoring genocide.  It is good business to say \u201cno\u201d to the customer who wants help in evading taxes.  And it is good business not to corrupt government officials. \n\nCompanies with a reputation for a sound culture of compliance tend to do well at harmonizing their organizational value system and their compliance rules.  If you look at those companies, you see success.\n\nThanks for listening.\n\n1 Disclaimer: The views expressed are the views of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or any component of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n2 E.

    "content": "Good afternoon.  It is a pleasure to be here today to talk with you about some of the research being conducted by the New York Fed on the measurement of household expectations, including households\u2019 expectations of inflation.  The views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or of the Federal Reserve System.  To begin, I\u2019d like to acknowledge some colleagues of mine who have managed our household survey project and conducted much of the research that I\u2019ll speak about today\u2014namely Olivier Armantier, Giorgio Topa, Wilbert van der Klaauw, and Basit Zafar.\n\nIn 2012, my colleague Simon Potter spoke to this conference about the approach that researchers at the New York Fed adopted in rolling out a household survey of expectations.  Today, I will report on the survey, which is the result of more than six years of research, including a pilot survey that was conducted for about five years, and the published survey that we ran for a year prior to its first publication in January 2014.\n\nStarting in the fall of 2007, the New York Fed has conducted a long-term research project to improve our understanding of existing measures of consumer expectations, and to explore the feasibility of expanding and potentially improving these measures.  We developed and then tested new questions on expectations, designed measures of individual forecast uncertainty, and collected information on expectations and decisions for a broader range of household behavior than is currently gathered by existing surveys.  In general, we wanted to understand better the process of forming expectations and updating those expectations, as well as the links between expectations and consumer behavior.\n\nIn pursuing this project, we collaborated with the RAND Corporation, other Federal Reserve Banks, academic economists, and psychologists with expertise in survey design.  We conducted in-depth cognitive interviews and fielded psychometric survey modules utilizing RAND\u2019s American Life Panel, and various convenience samples created by researchers at Carnegie Mellon.   Finally, we conducted many experimental surveys as part of the American Life Panel internet survey.  Incorporating the lessons we learned from these initiatives led to the final design and implementation of our Survey of Consumer Expectations.\n\nOur goal throughout has been to collect timely and high-quality information on consumer expectations and decisions.  We were particularly interested in filling in what we viewed as gaps in existing sources of information on household behavior, including data on household finance, labor, and housing market expectations.  In addition, we decided that a rotating panel structure, one that tracks the same individuals over time, was necessary for many research and policy applications. Having a panel reduces the variability induced by changes in composition month to month and increases the precision of any measured changes in expectations.\n\nBefore we implemented the survey, our proposal was reviewed and approved by the Bank\u2019s senior management.  Next, we issued a request for proposals and received three bids from independent survey organizations to field our survey design.  In the end, we chose to work with the Demand Institute, a partnership of the Conference Board and Nielsen.\n\nThe resulting Survey of Consumer Expectations is a nationally representative monthly internet-based survey. Its rotating panel consists of about 1,200 household heads.  We find that the internet approach allows us a great deal of flexibility to ask new questions, and it makes it considerably easier to pose probabilistic questions and to run experiments.  It is also\u2014and this is an important consideration\u2014the most cost-effective mode of collection; at the same time, there is also some evidence of higher response accuracy to personally sensitive questions.  Our sample is based on the Conference Board\u2019s Consumer Confidence Survey sample, which is drawn from U.S. postal addresses.  Respondents are compensated with a payment of $15 per survey, and surveys vary in length from fifteen to thirty minutes.  Our first-time response rate is about 60 percent, and we find that respondents have somewhat greater-than-average education and income.  The average response rate among repeat respondents is more than 80 percent. We use weights based on the American Community Survey to construct summary statistics for our public releases.\n\nThe survey consists of a core monthly module on expectations about macroeconomic and household-level variables and an additional quarterly module that allows us to address special topics.  Our core module contains questions about survey respondents\u2019 expectations for inflation, wage growth, home prices, various commodities, household income and spending, taxes, government debt, credit access, and job search.  So far, quarterly modules have included questions on housing and employment, work history, job search, retirement, financial literacy, consumption and savings behavior, student loans, and various field experiments.  These quarterly modules are developed by Federal Reserve staff in collaboration with academic consultants and the Nielsen team.  First, however, new questions are evaluated using cognitive interviews, and every new module is pilot-tested before being put into the field.\n\nThe Bank began publishing the results of the Survey in January 2014, after having fielded the Survey since December 2012.  We introduced it through a series of posts on our Liberty Street Economics blog; eventually, after a suitable embargo period, we plan to release to the public all the micro data from the Survey.\n\nApproach to and Benefits of Eliciting Probabilistic Beliefs\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, an important innovation of our Survey is that, in addition to asking the respondent for a point forecast, it uses probabilistic questions to elicit a respondent\u2019s density forecast. By doing so, we aim to collect a more accurate and complete representation of individuals\u2019 subjective expectations, and the degree of uncertainty that they attach to their forecasts. \n\nOur method for eliciting density forecasts builds on a large body of empirical work, led by economist Charles Manski, which involves the use of probabilistic survey question formats to measure a respondent\u2019s beliefs about an uncertain future event. Our specific question format was further tested during the experimental pilot phase of the project. Our density forecast question asks respondents to assign probabilities to pre-determined intervals or bins for future outcomes. For example, as shown on Slide 2, for year-ahead inflation, we ask for the \u201cpercent chance\u201d that inflation will be between 0 percent and 2 percent, 2 percent and 4 percent, 4 percent and 8 percent, etc., with similar bins used for deflation. In a similar fashion, we solicit respondents\u2019 density forecasts for year-ahead earnings growth, house price change expectations, and three-year ahead inflation. \n\nFor each individual respondent, the resulting density forecast enables us to construct individual measures of central tendency (such as the density mean or median) and uncertainty (such as the density interquartile range). To compute these, we use each individual\u2019s responses to the probabilistic questions to parametrically estimate the underlying forecast density function as proposed by Engelberg, Manski, and Williams in a 2009 Journal of Business and Economic Statistics article.  More specifically, when a respondent assigns a positive probability to three or more bins, we assume an underlying generalized beta distribution; and for fewer than three bins, we assume a triangular distribution. An example of such a fit is shown on Slide 3. \n\nOur findings over the past five years, based on different samples and different survey platforms, indicate that individuals are as willing and able to respond to well-written probabilistic questions as they are to traditional attitudinal questions on the same subject. Moreover, they do so sensibly, with responses to probabilistic questions having internal consistency and measurement reliability. The uncertainty expressed in consumers\u2019 density forecasts is reliably related to other measures of uncertainty. For example, individuals who express higher levels of uncertainty in their subjective probability distribution are more likely to report a range when they are originally asked for their point forecast, and the width of this self-reported range is positively correlated with measured uncertainty. In the case of inflation, we find that uncertainty about future inflation is negatively related to self-assessed responsibility for investment decisions, planning horizons for financial decisions, and the respondent\u2019s performance on a financial literacy measure. \n\nIn addition to providing a measure of uncertainty, an important advantage of density forecasts over point forecasts is that they remove ambiguity about which (if any) measure of central tendency an individual\u2019s point forecast corresponds to. Measures of central tendency derived from density forecasts are strongly correlated with point forecasts, and they have very similar average values; however, for roughly half of the responses, the point forecast falls in either the top or bottom quartile of the individual\u2019s forecast density, away from the center. Thus, interpersonal comparisons of point forecasts reflect not just differences in beliefs but also differences in what distribution statistic is being reported as point forecast by different survey participants. Density forecasts therefore allow for a more accurate measurement of disagreement among forecasters by using a common measure of central tendency (for example, the mean or the median of individuals\u2019 subjective probability distribution). \n\nFindings on Monthly Expectations\n\nThe Survey of Consumer Expectations provides a broad range of measures that are used routinely in our continuous assessment of the economy. We publish the monthly findings of our survey on the second Monday of each month on the New York Fed\u2019s website.\n\nThe Survey page is organized into three sections: inflation, labor market, and household finance. As shown in Chart 1, inflation expectations have been quite stable over the past twelve months, at both the one-year and the three-year ahead horizons. Our preferred measure is based on the median of the individual respondents\u2019 density means, but we also report the median point forecast as well as the interquartile range of the density means across respondents to highlight the dispersion of expectations across consumers. I will return to this aspect later. \n\nWe also report home price change expectations and price change expectations for various commodities. In our latest survey in May 2014, these expectations remained stable for the most part. Interestingly, medical care price change expectations have been gradually declining since December 2013, dropping from around 11 percent to 9.5 percent. The expected cost of a college education has also been dropping since the start of 2014. These results are shown in Charts 2 and 3. \n\nFor the labor market, we report the median expected earnings growth over the next twelve months. This figure has been stable at around 2 percent over the sample period, with a small increase to 2.4 percent over the winter that has since been reversed, as seen in Chart 4. We also track workers\u2019 perceived chances of losing their current job, of leaving their current job voluntarily, and of finding another job in three months should they lose their current one. Quits, layoffs, and the job-finding rate are important flow measures, and workers\u2019 expectations about these events enable us to gauge households\u2019 perceptions of future labor market conditions. As I will mention later, these expectations seem to be meaningfully related to job search behavior and other economic decisions by households. \n\nFinally, the household finance section contains time series of expected household income growth, expected household spending growth, changes in the amount of taxes that households expect to pay, as well as perceived credit availability\u2014both relative to one year ago and looking ahead to one year from now. As Chart 5 indicates, household income growth expectations declined slightly to 2.3 percent in May, but remained in the middle of the narrow band (2.0 \u2013 2.6) observed over the last twelve months. On the other hand, perceptions of credit availability continued to improve slightly in May, as shown in Chart 6. \n\nFor most of our charts, the website gives additional demographic detail, breaking down each time series by income, education, age, numeracy, and region of the country. Further, for our main measures (inflation, home price changes, and earnings growth) we also report the time series of forecast uncertainty. One interesting finding\u2014consistent with our prior research\u2014is that forecast uncertainty about inflation is significantly higher for low education, low income, low numeracy respondents.  These findings can be seen in Chart 7. \n\nSummary of Past Research\n\nLet me now briefly describe some of the basic research we have carried out through our consumer surveys.  We have focused on two broad questions to date. First, we have investigated the connection between inflation expectations and behavior in a financially incentivized investment field experiment. In this study, survey respondents were asked for their inflation expectations. Subsequently, within the course of the same survey, they were asked to choose between two possible financial investments, one that gives a fixed nominal return after twelve months, and another that yields a return indexed by inflation, again after one year. Respondents were told that two survey participants would be drawn at random and be paid according to their choice in the investment after twelve months. \n\nTheory predicts that respondents would be more likely to pick the inflation-protected investment if they expect higher inflation. Indeed, we find a strong association between expectations and actual choices in the experiment. Furthermore, those who express higher uncertainty about future inflation are also more likely to choose the inflation-protected investment. Both patterns are in accordance with the theory. Interestingly, the connection between expectations and experimental choices is weaker for respondents with low education, numeracy, and financial literacy. Our research thus shows that consumer expectations elicited through surveys are correlated in a meaningful way with actual behavior. We also find that expectations inform behavior in other contexts: for instance, workers who express a higher perceived chance of losing their current job over the next twelve months also search harder for a new job and exhibit a drop in spending plans relative to the present over the same time horizon. \n\nThe second area of research related to our consumer survey has focused on the formation and updating of inflation expectations. Through another field experiment embedded in our American Life Panel survey modules, we have examined how respondents update their expectations after receiving information about either past food price inflation or future inflation forecasts by professional forecasters. Before the information treatment, and again after the provision of information, respondents were asked for their inflation expectations. We also asked for respondents\u2019 priors about the information that was provided, to see whether those who have larger perception gaps are more likely to update their expectations, and if they would do so by a larger amount. \n\nWe found that respondents revise their expectations in the direction predicted by theory after receiving new information. Further, the extent of revisions is correlated with the size of their perception gaps. Finally, respondents are more receptive to the new information when the uncertainty expressed in their baseline expectations is greater. All three findings are consistent with rational, Bayesian updating of expectations.\n\n Moving beyond average effects, we also found that our information treatment leads to a significant decline in the cross-sectional dispersion of inflation expectations, and causes the distribution of inflation expectations to converge toward its center\u2014particularly for those who had high baseline expectations and were less informed ex ante. In fact, average revised expectations were nearer to actual realized CPI inflation as a result of our intervention. This is an encouraging result: it suggests that policymakers could partially influence the high-expectation right-tail of the inflation expectations distribution through public information campaigns in the spirit of our information treatments. \n\nWhy Heterogeneity for Consumers, and Why Are Expectations High?\n\nAn important and well-known distinctive feature of survey inflation expectations of individual consumers and firms\u2014when compared with that of professional forecasters\u2014is the much larger dispersion across individuals\u2019 beliefs about future inflation and the greater right-skewedness, or long right-tail, of this distribution. \n\nA number of different explanations have been proposed for the larger heterogeneity in beliefs, the larger proportion of extreme high responses, and the subsequent higher mean inflation forecast among consumers, summarized in Slide 11. First, in our research, we have found a tendency among a subset of respondents to think about specific prices, and especially those most salient to them, in coming up with a forecast. These often tend to be prices of goods that changed the most or are most volatile, such as food and gas prices. As a result, respondents who think about specific prices tend to report higher inflation expectations. Respondents who instead think more about a broader overall measure of inflation tend to report lower forecasts. \n\nSeveral alternative explanations that have been proposed in the recent literature for the large heterogeneity in beliefs focus on differences in information sets or in expectation-formation processes. These include sticky information models, in which new information is slow to diffuse through the population (Mankiw and Reis, 2002), perhaps because agents only probabilistically pay attention to experts or to news (Carroll, 2003). They also include noisy information models, in which agents form expectations based on noisy private signals (Woodford, 2001). Other explanations are based on the use of some form of adaptive learning (Evans and Honkapohja, 2001), switching between different prediction rules (Branch, 2004); or learning from lifetime inflation experiences (Malmendier and Nagel, 2013; Madeira and Zafar, 2012). \n\nIn our information-based experiment that I discussed earlier, we found that cross-sectional disagreement (variance) in expectations falls after our information treatments, which is consistent with a sticky-information model and points to the importance of private information and information constraints. We also found evidence of gender differences in updating behavior, which in turn may reflect differences in gathering and evaluating new information. Numeracy, financial literacy, and education also appear to play a role in explaining dispersion across respondents, as seen in Chart 8. In our research, we have found extreme inflation expectations, especially high values, to be associated with lower financial literacy and numeracy skills, and with being relatively under-informed about past inflation or inflation-related facts. \n\nFinally, there exists suggestive evidence of respondents forecasting under asymmetric loss, with respondents appearing to be averse to under-estimating inflation. Whereas it is common to assume the mean is being reported\u2014implying that respondents generate forecasts under symmetric square loss\u2014the evidence suggests that some individuals\u2019 forecasts are biased away from the mean, suggesting forecasting using an asymmetric loss function. Heterogeneity in loss aversion would contribute to the cross-sectional heterogeneity of inflation expectations. Moreover, asymmetric loss would generate a mean bias that will vary in size with the uncertainty of individual expectations, and hence is likely nonconstant over time. This evidence points to another potential advantage of density forecasts: their reporting may be less affected by loss aversion than simple point forecasts. \n\nWhile there are several possible explanations for the large dispersion of inflation forecasts among consumers, this heterogeneity is typically higher than that observed in various surveys of professional forecasters. In closing, I would like to speculate on a few potential reasons as to why the dispersion measured among professional forecasters may be too low relative to a \u201ctrue\u201d dispersion in expectations.\n\nFirst, asymmetric incentives may induce a desire to conform. If professional survey respondents have beliefs that are far from the consensus, they might face an asymmetric payoff: a small positive payoff for being correct, but a decidedly negative payoff for being incorrect.  This may cause a tendency to converge on a consensus belief. Similarly, in pricing TIPS, a trader with a nonconformist view faces costs in taking that view, so even if ultimately proven correct, the costs of establishing such a position may deter the nonconformist view\u2019s from being reflected in market prices.  Second, professional forecasters may be overly exposed to similar \u201cworld views,\u201d sharing similar data, reports, and analyses. This may lead to an information aggregation bias of sorts, in which forecasters share the same information set, which is an aggregate of finer information, and which may result in the loss of some important information.\n\nThe next charts describe the median four-quarter-ahead CPI forecast and the dispersion around that median for the Blue Chip survey and the U.S. Survey of Professional Forecasters. While there is significant overlap in the two sets of respondents, there is an important difference between the two surveys: respondents are anonymous in the U.S. Survey of Professional Forecasters, whereas they are identified by name in the Blue Chip survey. The asymmetric payoffs described earlier may therefore have more of an impact in the Blue Chip survey than in the U.S. Survey of Professional Forecasters, leading to less dispersion in the former than in the latter.\n\nChart 9 shows that the median forecast is substantially the same across the two surveys. However, as seen in Chart 10, there is some evidence of lower heterogeneity among forecasters in the Blue Chip survey compared with the Survey of Professional Forecasters, especially in recent periods, which, in retrospect, were periods of high fundamental uncertainty in the economy.  In both periods, during the run up to the financial crisis and its aftermath, most forecasters were mistaken about future growth rates and inflation rates by relatively large amounts. Both surveys of professional forecasters exhibit significantly less dispersion than the Survey of Consumer Expectations \u2014even when focusing only on \u201csophisticated\u201d respondents with high education and numeracy.\n\nThis suggests that there may be some scope for the sort of mechanisms I described, which may induce the \u201cfundamental\u201d heterogeneity in beliefs to be suppressed in surveys of professional forecasters. Consequently, household surveys may add important information on \u201cfundamental\u201d heterogeneity of beliefs relative to professional surveys, as the latter may reflect, in part, relativistic payoffs or shared information sets which produce an excessive consensus of views.\n\nThank you for listening to me today; I would be happy to take some questions on our research on inflation expectations.\n \n\nReferences\n\nArmantier, O., S.

    "content": "Good afternoon.  I thank you for the opportunity to address your association.  It is always a pleasure to speak with the different communities that make up the Second Federal Reserve District and it is especially gratifying to be here in Puerto Rico. \n\nAs with other parts of our District, the New York Fed is dedicated to the people of Puerto Rico and to their future growth and prosperity.  Our commitment is reflected in our ongoing work with our many partners in Puerto Rico.  Over the past several years we have held three forums (cosponsored with the local Small Business Administration office, the Puerto Rico Small Business Development and Technology Center and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), which provided technical assistance to help small businesses access capital, procure government contracts, and export their products and services. We also continue to promote financial literacy through our ongoing partnership with the Puerto Rico Bankers Association, and we have cosponsored the Financial Awareness Video Festival working with students at local colleges to produce short videos highlighting aspects of financial literacy.  Let me just pause for a moment to say congratulations to this year\u2019s winner: Pontificia de Ponce. \n\nIn addition to this work, our commitment is reflected in our research on issues of concern to the Island.  Our economists monitor and analyze local economic conditions.  A complement to our internal research is the outreach that I and other senior bank staff undertake to meet with our stakeholders\u2014the leaders in the business community, members of professional organizations like yourselves, academics, students, elected officials and leaders of nonprofits\u2014to hear firsthand about the issues and problems facing the people in our district. What we learn during these engagements also helps to shape our understanding of the issues facing the Puerto Rico economy and inform our efforts to support it.  Earlier on this trip I met with leading business owners from many different sectors of the economy, elected officials and several agency heads.  And from what I have learned so far, there are many important initiatives underway to effect change and to address what are clearly large and complex issues.\n\nOn my last visit to the Island in 2011, I saw examples of expansion and growth.  This gave me confidence that Puerto Rico has the capability to be an economic success story. However, my discussions with a range of stakeholders confirmed to me that conditions were not what we want them to be\u2014in particular, growth and expansion were not happening either fast enough or broadly enough.  At the urging of several business and community leaders, I commissioned a team at the New York Fed to analyze the challenges facing the Puerto Rico economy and to put forth recommendations on how to capitalize on the Island\u2019s strengths and restore growth.  Informed by consultations with local, national and international experts and stakeholders on the Island, we released that report in 2012.1  \n\nWe presented five recommendations:  (1) reduce barriers to labor force participation and job creation; (2) reform the energy industry, particularly, improve the efficiency of the electric utility\u2019s operations; (3) lower the costs of doing business; (4) foster partnerships between industry and higher education; and (5) promote independent policy evaluation.  These recommendations were not presented as simple quick fixes, but rather as important steps to help improve the Island\u2019s competitiveness over time. \n\nSince that report was issued, positive steps toward reform have been made in some areas.  The recent bill reforming the energy sector and related efforts to expand the use of alternative energy sources should over time help to reduce the Island\u2019s high costs of electricity.  Additionally, the Commonwealth\u2019s economic development strategy is seeking to capitalize on the strong pharmaceutical presence on the Island, to promote knowledge-based services and, importantly, to improve the general business environment on the Island. \n\nMore recently, though, serious fiscal challenges have surfaced that are closely interrelated with the Island\u2019s ongoing weak economic performance.  Persistent deficits in the Commonwealth\u2019s fiscal accounts as well as mounting deficits in the operation of the several major public corporations have substantially raised the Island\u2019s overall level of public debt and led to serious concerns about whether the Island\u2019s fiscal position is sustainable.  \n\nIn light of the fiscal pressures Puerto Rico now faces, the New York Fed is undertaking an update to our earlier report. In this new report, we plan to focus on Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal health.  We will examine the factors leading to the sizeable buildup of public debt on the Island and the key variables that will determine its future trend.  In some ways, the data on Puerto Rico\u2019s public debt clearly define the fiscal problems the Island faces.  But meeting with a variety of stakeholders, as I have on this visit, will help to inform our analysis and will provide us with concrete evidence of how these issues are playing out across the Puerto Rico economy.  \n\nThe clear challenge going forward will be for the Commonwealth government to continue to make progress on its efforts to raise its economic growth rate while at the same time to take credible steps to constrain the buildup of debt.  The demanding choices Puerto Rico makes today will affect its long-run economic prospects and the future livelihood of its residents.   \n\nNow I would like to review recent developments in the Puerto Rico economy and then outline for consideration and discussion several steps to help put the Island on a path toward fiscal health. \n\nAs always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nEconomic Conditions in Puerto Rico\n\nLet me turn to economic conditions in Puerto Rico.  As you are well aware, the news has not been good.  Puerto Rico\u2019s economy has been in a slump for nearly a decade. After declining for five straight years, real (inflation-adjusted) gross national product (GNP) rose 0.9 percent in fiscal year 2012 and only 0.3 percent in 2013, rates considerably below the respective U.S. mainland growth rates.  A monthly index produced by the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico paints a similar picture of an economy that has stabilized but at a depressed level.  We are finally beginning to see some signs of improvement in economic activity on the Island, though there is little evidence to suggest that the strong recovery that we seek has yet taken hold.     \n\nPuerto Rico\u2019s labor market remains weak.  Overall payroll employment fell by about 10 percent between 2006 and 2010 and has leveled off since then.  Employment in the private sector has been increasing modestly, with some notable pockets of relatively brisk job creation in leisure and hospitality, professional and business services and private education and health services\u2014employment in each of these sectors now far exceeds its prerecession levels. Cutbacks in government employment, however, have largely offset the private-sector gains realized over the past few years.  \n\nLow labor force participation rates and high unemployment rates remain perhaps the biggest challenges to the Puerto Rico economy.   Our earlier report cited low labor force participation among younger and less educated workers as one important factor limiting the Island\u2019s competitiveness.  Since that report, overall labor force participation has continued to decline. The unemployment rate on the Island has consistently exceeded the rate on the mainland by several percentage points.  Although the rate has fallen by more than a full percentage point year to date, the gap with the mainland remains wide.  Moreover, poor labor market opportunities for many workers have contributed to a significant increase in the rate of out-migration of Puerto Rico\u2019s residents, accelerating the Island\u2019s population decline. \n\nThe prolonged period of weak economic growth has compounded Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal problems:  Puerto Rico\u2019s public sector debt has been on an upward trend for a decade.  The stagnation of the economy and persistent fiscal deficits underlie this debt buildup.  The level of outstanding debt as a percentage of the Island\u2019s annual GNP, a ratio used by many fiscal analysts, rose from about 60 percent in 2000 to more than 100 percent in 2013.   Debt ratios in this range can inhibit economic growth in that they generally lead to higher financing costs, which in turn, can lead to constraints on access to further financing.  The recent downgrading of Puerto Rico\u2019s public debt to non-investment grade was a clear signal that the current fiscal situation poses serious risks to the Island\u2019s economic future.  \n\nSteps toward Fiscal Sustainability \n\nNext, I will discuss the buildup of Puerto Rico\u2019s public debt and then provide some thoughts on ways to improve the Island\u2019s fiscal health.  To open this discussion, it is worth noting some key features of Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal institutional environment.  The Commonwealth has a close relationship with the U.S. government which, in many ways, is analogous to that of a mainland state.  Puerto Rico shares a common market and a common currency with the U.S. mainland leading to strong economic interdependencies.   Federal aid is a major source of revenue for the Commonwealth and Puerto Rican residents participate in large U.S. social insurance programs such as Social Security and Medicare.  In addition, Puerto Rican debt trades as a municipal security in the U.S. capital markets, and much of the interest earned on this debt is exempt from local, state and federal income taxes, regardless of where in the U.S. the investor lives.   And like all but one state, Vermont, Puerto Rico has a self-imposed requirement to balance its budget. \n\nIn many ways, however, the Commonwealth operates more independently than other jurisdictions on the mainland.  Residents of Puerto Rico, unlike those of the states, do not pay U.S. personal income taxes unless they are employed by the U.S. government.  The many large public corporations on the Commonwealth\u2019s balance sheet also distinguish it from many states, although some states\u2014New York is an example\u2014also house a number of public corporations and authorities.  Finally, a notable difference from other mainland jurisdictions is that Puerto Rico\u2019s balanced budget requirement, while found in the constitution and relatively stringent in form, appears not to have been effective in constraining the growth of the Commonwealth\u2019s debt.    \n\nThe debt buildup reflects, in part, some of these unique features of Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal institutions, policies and practices.  In particular, the public sector in Puerto Rico comprises not only the Commonwealth government but also the municipal governments and a number of public corporations.  Prominent among these public corporations are the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), the Puerto Rico Highway and Transportation Authority (PRHTA), and the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA).  The public corporations are especially important both for the role they have played in issuing debt as well as the scale of the public services they provide to the Island\u2019s population.  Currently, they account for almost 40 percent of the Island\u2019s total debt and have been responsible for much of the debt buildup\u2014of the roughly 43 percentage point increase in the debt-to-GNP ratio between 2000 and 2013, the public corporations accounted for almost 85 percent of that increase.  \n\nSeveral measures put the Island\u2019s weak fiscal condition into perspective.  Total public debt in Puerto Rico is quite high\u2014roughly 100 percent of GNP.  This is far higher than in any U.S. mainland state; among the states, the highest ratio is New York at 29 percent.2   \n\nHowever, since most Puerto Ricans do not pay federal income taxes, the large federal debt burden could arguably be considered not to be a burden to Puerto Rico, in contrast to the mainland states.  Ranking the states and Puerto Rico with the federal debt burden added for the mainland states, but excluded for Puerto Rico, pushes Puerto Rico down to 14th in the rankings.  However, even with this adjustment Puerto Rico still has a high debt burden.  \n\nIn addition to the growing stock of publicly issued debt, Puerto Rico faces large future contingent liabilities via unfunded pension system liabilities. While the Commonwealth has a variety of options for managing these liabilities, they are nonetheless obligations that are relevant in assessing the Commonwealth\u2019s overall balance sheet. \n\nIt seems likely that any country in a similar debt situation to Puerto Rico would have faced difficulty in continuing to raise money in the bond market and would have faced questions about the sustainability of its debt level.  Debt sustainability is generally defined as a condition where government debt is at a reasonable level\u2014one with acceptable risks to market confidence and long-term economic growth\u2014and is not on a path to increase indefinitely relative to some measure of national income.  Stabilizing Puerto Rico\u2019s debt as a share of the Island\u2019s income and then reducing its debt to more sustainable levels should be a key goal of the Island\u2019s fiscal and economic policy.  While the precise path toward lower debt burden is uncertain, the trend is largely determined by the interaction of three factors:  the government\u2019s fiscal policy, the growth rate of the economy and the interest rate on the public debt.   \n\nRegarding the buildup of new public debt, the Commonwealth government has stated its intention that the general fund budget will be balanced in fiscal year 2015.  This intention, together with the stance of not using deficit financing to support public corporations, should greatly limit the issuance of new debt.  The measures put in place during this year have already had some success in cutting the projected budget gap for the current fiscal year.  \n\nBut what other steps can be taken to move the Island toward fiscal health?  Let me start by saying that Puerto Rico is not alone in facing fiscal problems like these. Governments frequently find that public sector management becomes especially challenging when their economies are undergoing major transitions of the sort that have been taking place in Puerto Rico in the last decade. In the mainland U.S., cities like New York, Washington and Philadelphia experienced major fiscal stresses as they adjusted to the transition from manufacturing to service-based economies. Those cities faced market pressures not unlike those facing the Commonwealth today, and when their leadership tackled the issues head-on, the cities emerged stronger.  The problems that these cities faced required the government and the private sector to work together to find solutions.  In all cases that required important changes and sacrifices.  This was most effective when the necessary adjustments were shared broadly rather than concentrated on a single group.  \n\nIn the spirit of assisting the Commonwealth in this endeavor, I want to preview how these issues appear to me, and to suggest some steps for improving fiscal outcomes on the Island.  I present these ideas in order to solicit your input, based on your deeper understanding of the situation. I present them not as quick fixes\u2014as there are no quick fixes to these fiscal situations\u2014but as changes to financial practices that over the next several years can help to restore fiscal health to the Island. \n\nThe first step would be for the Commonwealth government to reinvigorate its efforts to raise economic growth.  While Puerto Rico has a number of features that make it a potentially strong economy, economic growth on the Island has been weak for almost a decade.  To restore growth and raise living standards, it is critically important for policymakers to expand efforts to marshal the Island\u2019s considerable strengths\u2014a bilingual and well-educated adult population, an open economy occupying a central position in the Caribbean, a wide experience as a host to multinational corporations, and close ties to the U.S. mainland economy.  \n\nWhile the challenges to restoring growth are clearly complex, I want to highlight some key areas where policies to support efficiency and growth might be strengthened.  First, barriers to job creation and active participation in the labor market should be reduced.  The current structure of labor market incentives could be examined to ensure that firms do not face significant hurdles in creating jobs and workers are not discouraged from entering the labor force.  Second, policymakers should continue their efforts to create a more dynamic business environment, including the elimination of unnecessary costs of setting up and operating a business, particularly with respect to energy costs.  Third, economic development efforts should consider a more proactive approach to utilizing the Island\u2019s educated workforce and well-established higher education system.  One possibility is to look for ways to expand the support for the formation of partnerships between higher education and industry, which have proven to be effective ways for regions to promote innovation, entrepreneurship and economic growth.   Puerto Rico has many of the ingredients in place to harness the benefits of these industry-education partnerships and policymakers should begin to look for promising opportunities for mutually beneficial collaboration. \n\nA second step is to comprehensively reform the Commonwealth\u2019s tax system, which is heavily dependent on income taxes and tends to levy high rates on narrow bases. When rates are high, it increases incentives for activities to be shielded from taxes, perhaps by moving activity to the informal sector, or perhaps by halting the activity altogether. Either way, collecting the necessary revenue requires rates to be even higher on activities that remain in the base, reinforcing the problem. Typically, comprehensive reform is necessary to break the cycle by simultaneously broadening the tax base and reducing rates across a range of taxes. Such a reform would likely produce a significant bonus in terms of faster economic growth, particularly in the formal sector.\n\nA third step would be to improve the Commonwealth\u2019s financial reporting.  Puerto Rico\u2019s unique status means that it is one of few jurisdictions whose finances are not regularly surveyed by a public agency. The U.S. Census Bureau reports annually on mainland state finances and the International Monetary Fund generally reports on the finances of nations. These surveys provide significant transparency into the finances of those entities, which is invaluable for policymakers and citizens wishing to understand, monitor and exert control and discipline over the fiscal policies of their governments. They may also serve the purpose of increasing investor understanding of how the Commonwealth\u2019s finances compare to other governments. \n\nNew York City\u2019s experience in the 1970s shows the value of better financial reporting.  Prior to the City\u2019s fiscal crisis in 1975 through 1977, New York had relatively poor financial reporting practices. As part of its recovery from that crisis, and a condition of accessing credit, the City\u2019s reporting improved dramatically and has since won several awards. Along with those improvements, the City\u2019s access to credit markets steadily improved.  Economic research indicates that more transparent budgets are associated with lower public sector funding costs.  \n\nA fourth step would be to look for ways to strengthen the performance of public corporations.  A major difference between Puerto Rico\u2019s balance sheet and those of the states is the presence of large, heavily indebted, corporate-like entities that continue to lose money and increase borrowing. For any financial reform agenda to be successful, it must confront this issue head on. Key elements of a successful reform strategy might include strengthening the public corporations\u2019 financial standing and controlling the future flow of liabilities.    \n\nPuerto Rico could also seek out the opportunity to benefit from outside management expertise, including the wide experiences of U.S. mainland states.  An independent regulator for utilities is the norm throughout mainland states.  By leveraging the expertise and reputation of existing independent regulatory agencies, Puerto Rico may improve the efficiency of its public corporations while reassuring investors.   \n\nAs a fifth step, the Commonwealth could benefit from adopting fiscal institutions more like mainland states.  Balanced budget rules are far from perfect, but by following the states\u2019 model\u2014splitting the budget into an operating piece that must be balanced and a capital piece that can be financed with debt\u2014Puerto Rico could better align financing methods with its spending priorities.\n\nA sixth step is for the Commonwealth to implement a framework to help ensure that budget targets are met.  A key aspect of such a framework would require that the authorities implement multi-year budgeting, in which revenue and expenditure plans are articulated over a three to five year horizon.  Such a framework should also incorporate a review of the central government\u2019s macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts by a non-partisan independent entity, the views and analysis of which could be published in coordination with the Commonwealth\u2019s proposed budget for any given fiscal year.  New York City, for instance, uses this type of framework.\n\nThe steps should be viewed as potential ways to improve Puerto Rico\u2019s finances over time and I present them to you for consideration and discussion.  The decisions are obviously up to you.  Other countries, U.S. mainland states and municipalities facing similar fiscal issues have been able to overcome them.  I believe the Island can develop a strategy that will enable a return to fiscal health. \n\nThank you for your kind attention and I will now be happy to take some questions.\n\n1 Report on the Competitiveness of Puerto Rico\u2019s Economy, Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 2012.

    "content": "Good morning and welcome once again to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2019s Regional Economic Press Briefing.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak with you.  This morning I want to focus on economic conditions in our region, giving particular attention to the kinds of jobs created in New York, Northern New Jersey and Puerto Rico during the recovery from the Great Recession.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhile the New York Fed has broad operating responsibilities on behalf of the FOMC and the Federal Reserve System, we are also deeply committed to our region.  That commitment manifests itself in several ways.  We produce monthly indices of economic activity that enable us to gauge the performance of the region\u2019s economy.  We conduct a regular poll of small businesses in our region, and just last week, we hosted a summit examining new sources of credit for small businesses.  We developed block-by-block flood maps which were created after Superstorm Sandy to inform residents and businesses in Brooklyn of their vulnerability to future storms.  And, we work with area schools to improve students\u2019 understanding of monetary policy, the Fed and economics.\n\nIt is also important to me that I visit different parts of our District on a regular basis and talk directly with the people who live and work here.  For example, last fall I visited Western New York and saw the many positive changes helping to revitalize what has been a slow growing economy for some time.  Earlier this year, I met with companies on a visit to Brooklyn and observed some of the new hi-tech jobs that are being brought to the City\u2014a good precursor to today\u2019s presentation.  While in Brooklyn, I also visited Brownsville, a neighborhood which underscores the reality of the challenges that many face and the fact that the economy is not improving for everyone.  Later this year, I have similar trips planned to Puerto Rico, the Bronx and Albany.  Obtaining on-the-ground intelligence is valuable and helps shape my view of the region, the economy and my outlook on policy.\n\nAs you may know, the District we cover is quite diverse.  It is not just a single regional economy, but rather many different local economies.  Let me talk a bit about how the different parts of our region have been doing.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions\n\nSince our last briefing in November, the economic recovery has been variable across the region\u2014strong in some places but weaker in others.  Let me begin with the area that has struggled the most.  Puerto Rico\u2019s economy has, unfortunately, been in a deep economic slump that has lasted for nearly a decade.  Over the past few years, public sector job losses have continued to weigh against modest job gains in the Island\u2019s private sector.  And ongoing difficulties in the Island\u2019s labor market continue, with labor force participation still alarmingly low, and unemployment stubbornly high at a rate well above the mainland\u2019s.  The good news is that we are finally beginning to see some firming in economic conditions on the Island. \n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, New York City has been experiencing a robust recovery.  While the Great Recession was clearly the worst post-war downturn in U.S. history, New York City was not as badly affected as the rest of the country.  As of April, almost five years since the end of the recession, the nation has recovered nearly all of the jobs that were lost.  By contrast, New York City reached this milestone more than two years ago.  And, as we\u2019ve highlighted in previous press briefings, this rebound has occurred despite the lack of any significant recovery in employment on Wall Street. \n\nThe recovery has generally progressed at a more moderate pace in the other parts of our region.  Consistent with historical patterns, Upstate New York as a whole has been growing modestly, with Buffalo and Rochester doing a little bit better than their upstate peers.  Binghamton, on the other hand, has really been struggling with no signs yet of any meaningful recovery.  Meanwhile, Northern New Jersey\u2019s economy had been growing fairly steadily until this past winter when activity softened, probably due at least in part to the unusually harsh weather.  Now that spring is finally upon us, we hope to see economic conditions improve more significantly.\n\nWhat Kinds of Jobs Have Been Created During the Recovery?\n\nLet me turn to the topic of today\u2019s press briefing:  how the types of jobs in the region have changed over the last business cycle.  Firms often change the way they utilize workers and the mix of skills they employ during recessions and recoveries.  The weakening demand during recessions forces firms to look for new ways to be more efficient to cope with hard times.  These adjustments do not affect all workers equally.  Indeed, it\u2019s what we typically think of as middle-skilled workers\u2014for example, construction workers, machine operators and administrative support personnel\u2014that are hardest hit during recessions.  Further, a feature of the Great Recession and indeed the prior two recessions, is that the middle-skill jobs that were lost don\u2019t all come back during the recoveries that follow.  Instead, job opportunities have tended to shift toward higher- and lower-skilled workers.\n\nAs we\u2019ll show, these same trends have played out in our region.  While there\u2019s been a good number of both higher-skill and lower-skill jobs created in the region during the recovery, opportunities for middle-skilled workers have continued to shrink.\n\nI believe it is important for us to highlight these job trends and to understand their implications for our region.  There have been significant and long-lasting changes to the nature of work.  As a result, many middle-skilled workers displaced during the recession are likely to find that their old jobs will never come back.  Furthermore, workers are increasingly facing higher skill requirements in order to land a good job.  These dynamics in the labor market present a host of challenges for the region to address.  However one thing is clear: workers will need more education, training and skills to take full advantage of the types of job opportunities being created in our region, as well as across the nation.  So, it\u2019s important that we work together to find ways to help people in our region adapt to these changes.\n\nI will now ask Jaison Abel to provide an update of economic conditions in our region."

    "date": "May 20, 2014",

    "content": "Thank you for inviting me to speak here today.  It always is a special pleasure to address my fellow economists.  In my remarks today, I am going to focus on the economic outlook and the implications of that outlook for monetary policy. \n\nMy views on the economy have not changed much since last fall.  Although economic growth stalled in the first quarter, some slowing was expected and unseasonably harsh winter weather appears to have done the rest.  The fundamental supports for a strengthening economy remain in place, and recent data seem to confirm that forecast.  On the price front, I expect inflation to drift higher over the remainder of the year as the effects of some temporary factors that have been holding inflation down dissipate and the labor market continues to tighten. \n\nIf my forecast is correct, as growth strengthens and inflation drifts higher, the focus will turn to monetary policy.  In particular, what will be the timing of lift-off?  And when lift-off occurs, how quickly will the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raise rates and to what level? \n\nAlso, with an exceptionally large balance sheet there will be considerable attention on the methods that the FOMC will likely use in order to exert control over the level of short-term rates.  I can\u2019t tell you yet how we will do it, but I am fully confident that we have the necessary tools to control the level of short-term rates and the credit creation process, and I will share with you some of my own thoughts on the subject.  As always, what I have to say here today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the FOMC or the Federal Reserve System. \n\nTurning first to economic activity, the trajectory of economic growth continues to disappoint.  Since the downturn ended in mid-2009, real GDP growth has averaged only 2.2 percent per year despite a very accommodative monetary policy.  This performance reflects three major factors\u2014the significant headwinds resulting from the bursting of the housing bubble, the shift of fiscal policy from expansion toward restraint, especially in 2012 and 2013, and a series of shocks from abroad\u2014most notably the European crisis. \n\nThe good news is that all three of these factors have abated.  With respect to the headwinds resulting from the financial crisis, they are gradually becoming less severe.  In particular, the sharp decline in household wealth due to the decline in housing prices and the weakness in equity prices has been largely reversed.  As housing prices have climbed, the number of homes moving into the foreclosure process and the number of households with mortgages underwater have fallen sharply.  Moreover, households have deleveraged their balance sheets.  Debt levels have declined and lower interest rates have cut financing costs.  As a result, the financial obligation ratio, which measures the debt servicing cost of households, has declined from a peak of 18.1 percent of disposable income in the fourth quarter of 2007 to 15.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013.  This is a level not seen since the early 1980s. \n\nOn the fiscal side, the amount of restraint has diminished sharply.  For 2014, the projected drag is about \u00bd percent of GDP, roughly half the level of 2013.  Moreover, much of this restraint was frontloaded into the beginning of the year, with the cessation of long-term unemployment compensation, the expiration of the bonus depreciation provisions and the higher tax rates that applied to final tax settlements for the 2013 tax year.  For the remainder of this year and next, the degree of fiscal restraint should be very modest. \n\nIn terms of the outlook abroad, the circumstances are more mixed.  Although Europe is doing better, Japan is digesting the large hike in consumption taxes that was implemented on April 1, Chinese growth is slowing and some other emerging market economies are coping with structural imbalances that are anticipated to lead to slower growth this year.  One obvious wildcard is the situation in Ukraine and relations with Russia.  How this will evolve is difficult to predict.  The big risk is that conditions deteriorate and the ultimate outcome is a disruption to energy supplies from Russia.  When all these cross-currents are considered, the impetus to growth from abroad appears little changed from last year.  \n\nNow a reasonable question would be: If the outlook is improving, then how does one explain the sharp slowdown in growth in the first quarter?  My own view is that the principal factors behind the slowdown were transitory so we should not be overly concerned at this point.  Some slowing in the first quarter was nearly inevitable.  Foreign trade and inventories provided unsustainably large contributions to growth over the second half of last year and payback for those large gains was expected in the first quarter of this year.  Also, the expiration of extended unemployment compensation benefits and bonus depreciation at the end of the year was likely to take some of the starch out of consumer spending and business fixed investment.  Beyond these anticipated factors, we had unusually harsh winter weather, which likely depressed housing activity, manufacturing production and some aspects of household spending such as motor vehicle purchases. \n\nWith the fundamentals of the economy improving and fiscal drag abating, I expect the economy to get back on to a roughly 3 percent growth trajectory over the remainder of this year, with some further strengthening likely in 2015.  But, there remains considerable uncertainty about that forecast and, given the persistent over-optimism about the growth outlook by Federal Reserve officials and others in recent years, we shouldn\u2019t count our chickens before they hatch. \n\nBusiness fixed investment and housing are two key areas where activity has been disappointing.  They need to kick in more forcefully for the economy to grow at an above trend rate for a sustained period. \n\nWith respect to capital spending, the recent trajectory has been very soft relative to the apparent strong underlying fundamentals.  Corporate cash flows have been strong, profit margins are high, balance sheets are healthy and financing generally appears readily available at low interest rates.  Moreover, the absolute level of capital outlays is low so that the capital stock is expanding only slowly.  Despite these positive fundamentals, real business spending on equipment and software has risen only 3.2 percent over the past four quarters and contracted in the first quarter.   This is a bit of a puzzle to me.  But, I expect it to be resolved by a pickup in capital spending.  Recent trends in durable goods orders and conversations I have had with businesses in my district suggest that such a pickup may finally be occurring. \n\nOn the housing side, residential investment has stalled out over the past few quarters.  Although I expected some slowing due to the rise in mortgage rates in the middle of 2013, the extent of the slowdown has surprised me given that the recent pace of housing starts\u2014roughly  1 million per year\u2014is far below what is consistent with the economy\u2019s underlying demographic trends. \n\nI think housing has been weaker than anticipated because several significant headwinds persist for this sector.  First, mortgage credit is still not readily available to households with lower credit scores.  Second, some people are coping with higher student loan debt burdens that have delayed their entry into the housing market as first-time homebuyers.  This, in turn, makes it more difficult for existing homeowners to sell and trade-up.  Third, there may be some ongoing difficulties increasing housing supply.  The housing downturn was very deep and protracted.  It takes time to shift resources back into this area.  Also, in some markets house prices still appear to be below the cost of building a new home.  Thus, in those markets, it remains uneconomic to undertake new home construction.  Although I expect that the housing recovery will resume, the pace will likely be slow, especially relative to past economic recoveries. \n\nWith respect to the outlook for prices, I think that inflation will drift upwards over the next year, getting closer to the FOMC\u2019s 2 percent objective for the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) deflator.  Some of the factors holding down inflation\u2014such as the cut in Medicare reimbursement rates last April\u2014were one-offs and are now dropping out of the year-over-year figures.  In some other areas, such as owners\u2019 equivalent rent, price pressures look likely to firm somewhat.  \n\nThat said, I see little prospect of inflation climbing sharply over the next year or two.  There still are considerable margins of excess capacity available in the economy\u2014especially in the labor market\u2014that should moderate price pressures.  Most notably, the trend of labor compensation is running at only about a 2 percent annualized pace.  This is far below the roughly 3\u00bd percent pace that would be consistent with trend productivity growth of 1 to 1\u00bd percent and the FOMC\u2019s 2 percent inflation objective. \n\nRecently, some economists have argued that the amount of slack in the labor market may be smaller than suggested by the official unemployment rate of 6.3 percent.  They focus on the level of short-term unemployment\u2014those workers unemployed for less than 27 weeks\u2014which has returned close to its average long-term level\u2014and argue that it is the short-term unemployed that are critical in driving compensation trends. \n\nMy own reading of this research suggests that one should not jump to such a conclusion.  Instead, I conclude:\n\nTo sum up, this isn\u2019t likely to be a case of black (only total unemployment matters) or white (only short-term unemployment matters) with respect to compensation cost trends.  I suspect that the degree of attachment falls on average as one is unemployed for longer periods of time.  But, I don\u2019t believe that this pattern of attachment is stable.  It is affected by the nature of the business cycle and how and why people have become long-term unemployed. \n\nBefore I turn to the implications of the economic outlook for monetary policy, let me leave you with a final thought on inflation and our inflation objective.  I think there is some confusion as to whether the FOMC\u2019s 2 percent inflation objective is a ceiling or not.  My own view is that 2 percent is definitely not a ceiling.  Once we reach 2 percent, I would expect that we would spend as much time slightly above 2 percent as below it, recognizing that we will hardly ever be exactly at 2 percent because of the inherent volatility in prices.  If inflation were to drift above 2 percent, all else equal, then we would tend to resist such a rise.  But, if inflation were slightly above 2 percent even as unemployment remained far above levels consistent with maximum employment, then the unemployment consideration would dominate because we would be further from the unemployment objective than we are from the inflation objective.  This should not surprise anyone.  This is what our \u201cbalanced approach\u201d implies. \n\nGiven my outlook for above-trend growth and inflation gradually drifting higher, the inevitable question is what this means for the monetary policy outlook.  Over the near-term, if circumstances evolve relatively close to my forecast, I would continue to favor gradually reducing the pace of asset purchases by staying on the same glide path of a $10 billion reduction in the monthly purchase pace following each FOMC meeting. \n\nAssuming asset purchases end sometime this fall, the focus will shift to the timing of lift-off, the pace of tightening once lift-off occurs and where short-term rates are ultimately headed over the longer-term.  The issue of how the Fed will manage its balance sheet will also be relevant, as well as how monetary policy will be conducted during a period when the amount of excess reserves in the banking system is unusually large.  I will give you some of my early thinking on each of these issues in the remainder of my remarks. \n\nTurning first to the timing of lift-off, how the outlook evolves matters.  We currently anticipate that a considerable period of time will elapse between the end of asset purchases and lift-off, but precisely how long is difficult to say given the inherent uncertainties surrounding the outlook.  If the economy is stronger than expected, causing the excess slack in the labor market to be absorbed sooner and inflation to rise more quickly than forecasted, then lift-off is likely to be pulled forward in time.  If, instead, economic growth disappoints, inflation stays unusually low and the labor market continues to exhibit evidence of considerable excess slack, then lift-off will likely be pushed back in time.1\n\nWith respect to the trajectory of rates after lift-off, this also is highly dependent on how the economy evolves.  My current thinking is that the pace of tightening will probably be relatively slow.  This depends, however, in large part, not only on the economy\u2019s performance, but also on how financial conditions respond to tightening.  After all, monetary policy works through financial conditions to affect aggregate demand and supply.  If the response of financial conditions to tightening is very mild\u2014say similar to how the bond and equity markets have responded to the tapering of asset purchases since last December\u2014this might encourage a somewhat faster pace.  In contrast, if bond yields were to move sharply higher, as was the case last spring, then a more cautious approach might be warranted. \n\nIn terms of the level of rates over the longer-term, I would expect them to be lower than historical averages for three reasons.  First, economic headwinds seem likely to persist for several more years.  While the wealth loss following the financial crisis has largely been reversed, the Great Recession has scarred households and businesses\u00ad\u2014this is likely to lead to greater precautionary saving and less investment for a long time.  Also, as noted earlier, headwinds in the housing area seem likely to dissipate only slowly. \n\nSecond, slower growth of the labor force due to the aging of the population and moderate productivity growth imply a lower potential real GDP growth rate as compared to the 1990s and 2000s.  Because the level of real equilibrium interest rates appears to be positively related to potential real GDP growth, this slower trend implies lower real equilibrium interest rates even after all the current headwinds fully dissipate. \n\nThird, changes in bank regulation may also imply a somewhat lower long-term equilibrium rate.  Consider that, all else equal, higher capital requirements for banks imply somewhat wider intermediation margins.  While higher capital requirements are essential in order to make the financial system more robust, this is likely to push down the long-term equilibrium federal funds rate somewhat. \n\nPutting all these factors together, I expect that the level of the federal funds rate consistent with 2 percent PCE inflation over the long run is likely to be well below the 4\u00bc percent average level that has applied historically when inflation was around 2 percent.  Precisely how much lower is difficult to say at this point in time. \n\nThe fact that the equilibrium real federal funds rate is likely to be lower for a long time underscores the need for caution in applying the benchmark Taylor Rule as a guide to the appropriate stance of monetary policy.  As typically applied, the Taylor Rule assumes an equilibrium real rate of interest of 2 percent.  This seems much too high in the current economic environment in which headwinds persist, and somewhat too high even when these headwinds fully dissipate. \n\nThe next question I wish to consider is how the Fed will likely manage its balance sheet as the taper process is completed and lift-off eventually occurs.  Unlike previous normalizations of monetary policy, which only involved the level of short-term rates, this prospective tightening cycle also involves considerations with respect to the size and composition of our balance sheet.  The Committee stated in its June 2011 exit principles that changes in short-term rates will be the primary means for adjusting monetary policy post-liftoff, not discretionary shifts in the balance sheet.  In other words, the balance sheet will be set on automatic pilot.  I believe this approach still very much applies. \n\nHowever, the language in the June 2011 exit principles concerning agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) sales no longer applies.  As Chairman Bernanke noted in the press conference following the June 2013 FOMC meeting: \u201cWhile participants continue to think that in the long run the Federal Reserve\u2019s portfolio should consist predominantly of Treasury securities, a strong majority now expects that the Committee will not sell agency mortgage-backed securities during the process of normalizing monetary policy.\u201d  The balance sheet would shrink post-lift-off as Treasury securities matured and mortgages were prepaid, but outright agency MBS sales are no longer contemplated during the process of monetary policy normalization. \n\nAlso, I think that the language in the June 2011 exit principles with respect to reinvestment needs to be revisited.  The exit principles state: \u201cTo begin the process of policy normalization, the Committee will likely first cease reinvesting some or all payments of principal on the securities holdings in the SOMA.\u201d  There are two considerations that suggest to me that ending the reinvestments prior to lift-off may not be the best strategy.  First, such a decision might complicate our communications regarding the process of normalization.  Ending reinvestments as an initial step risks inadvertently bringing forward any tightening of financial conditions as this might foreshadow the impending lift-off date for rates in a manner inconsistent with the Committee\u2019s intention. \n\nSecond, when conditions permit, it would be desirable to get off the zero lower bound in order to regain some monetary policy flexibility.  This goal would argue for lift-off occurring first followed by the end of reinvestment, rather than vice versa.  Delaying the end of reinvestment puts the emphasis where it needs to be\u2014getting off the zero lower bound for interest rates.  In my opinion, this is far more important than the consequences of the balance sheet being a little larger for a little longer. \n\nWith respect to the issue of how the FOMC will control money market rates with an enlarged balance sheet, the Federal Reserve already has the necessary tool\u2014the ability to pay interest on excess reserves.  However, the degree of control could be further buttressed.  Enhancing confidence in the Fed\u2019s ability to control money market rates, and hence, inflation, might also help keep inflation expectations well anchored. \n\nOne method the Fed has been testing is an overnight, fixed rate, reverse repo (RRP) facility.  The Federal Reserve posts a fixed interest rate and accepts cash from counterparties, which include some banks, dealers, money market funds, and government sponsored enterprises, on an overnight basis in return for a security.  The repo facility is \u201creverse\u201d because the direction in which the funds and securities move\u2014participants are lending funds to the Fed rather than vice versa.  Users of the facility are making the economic equivalent of an overnight collateralized loan of cash to the Federal Reserve. \n\nIf implemented, the facility could be set up as \u201cfull allotment,\u201d which means that there is no cap on the amount of funds accepted from any of its counterparties at the posted overnight interest rate.  Or, caps could be imposed on either an aggregate or per counterparty basis in order to limit total usage. \n\nThe amount of funds invested in the facility is likely to be sensitive to the spread between the posted interest rate and comparable money market rates and the level of caps placed on usage.  The narrower the spread to comparable money market rates, the greater the participation is likely to be.  In our ongoing tests with this facility, the New York Desk has varied the RRP rate from 1 to 5 basis points and the cap on usage by counterparty has gradually been increased to its current level of $10 billion.  As expected, narrower spreads to comparable money market rates and larger caps have led to greater usage. \n\nAlthough the testing process is still ongoing, early results suggest that the overnight RRP facility will set a floor under money market rates.  Treasury repo rates have generally traded no more than a basis point or two below the overnight RRP rate.2  Thus, the early evidence suggests that this facility would help strengthen our control over money market rates. \n\nTwo issues with the overnight reverse repo rate warrant careful consideration.  The first is how big a footprint the facility should have in terms of volume.  To the extent that the overnight RRP rate were set very close or equal to the interest rate on excess reserves (IOER) without caps, then this might result in a large amount of disintermediation out of banks through money market funds and other financial intermediaries into the facility.  This could encourage further development of the shadow banking system.  If this were deemed undesirable, this would argue for a wider spread between the overnight RRP and the IOER in order to reduce the volume of flows into the facility. \n\nThe second issue is the facility\u2019s potential impact on financial stability.  In particular, would such a facility make financial instability less likely?  And, when financial stress did occur, would such a facility amplify or dampen financial strains? \n\nOn the first point, it seems that such a facility would tend to make financial instability less likely.  The overnight RRP facility allows us to make a short-term safe asset more widely available to a broad range of financial market participants.  The provision of short-term safe assets by the official sector might crowd out the private creation of runnable money-like liquid assets.  This might enhance financial stability by reducing the likelihood of a financial crisis. \n\nHowever, if a financial crisis were to occur, the existence of a full allotment, overnight, RRP facility might exacerbate instability by encouraging runs out of more risky assets into the facility.  That is because the supply of a full allotment facility would be completely elastic at the given fixed rate.  Money market mutual funds and other providers of short-term financing could rapidly shift funds into the facility away from assets such as commercial paper that support the private sector.  In contrast, in the current regime, when financial crises lead to flows into less risky assets, their interest rates fall, limiting the appetite for these less risky assets.  Consequently, under a full allotment setup, runs could be larger and these runs could exacerbate the fall in the prices of riskier assets.  Note that the risk here is how quickly financial flows could reverse from one day to the next, not the average level of take-up of the facility over time. \n\nFortunately, this risk seems relatively easy to address.  One could design the facility to prevent rapid inflows during times of financial stress.  This could be done by building in circuit breakers such as caps on overall usage of the facility.  The circuit breakers would not affect the amount of take-up during normal times or prevent take-up from rising at moderate rates.  Instead, they would be in place to limit the pace and magnitude of inflows during times of stress. \n\nA second option to improve the Fed\u2019s control over short-term rates is to drain reserves by offering banks term deposit accounts in which to invest funds for longer terms than overnight.  There are two issues that might make this option somewhat less attractive.  First, to strengthen monetary policy control significantly through this course, it might be necessary to drain most of the $3 trillion of reserves.  This could be done of course with effort, but is the effort worth it? \n\nSecond, the Fed would undoubtedly have to \u201cpay up\u201d to induce banks to hold term deposit accounts relative to keeping their monies in reserves at the excess reserves interest rate.  This would likely result in higher Fed interest expenses relative to relying on an overnight RRP facility to set a floor on money market rates. \n\nThe choices here are important and I expect that considerable testing, analysis and discussion will be necessary to reach firm conclusions about the appropriate course.  My goal would be to clarify our intentions later this year, long before we begin to contemplate raising short-term rates. \n\nI also think that the choices are about how to conduct monetary policy during the transitional phase, not about the long-term monetary policy framework.  Longer term, the issue will be whether to return to the type of corridor system that was in place prior to the crisis or to instead to stay with the type of floor system that will likely be the type of regime that is in place as the balance sheet gradually normalizes.  I expect that the choices made over the near-term can be implemented in a way so as not to forestall either a corridor or a floor system over the longer term.  The experience we gain with operating monetary policy effectively with a very large balance sheet will undoubtedly inform that choice. \n\nBut, that topic is putting the cart far before the horse.  First, we need an economy that is strong enough to more fully utilize the nation\u2019s labor resources and to begin to push inflation back towards the Federal Reserve\u2019s long-term objective.  Only then can the monetary policy normalization process proceed.  Although we are making progress towards our goals, we still have a considerable way to go. \n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions. \n\n1It is worth noting that the views of market participants as expressed in the Eurodollar futures market and those of FOMC participants as expressed in the March Summary of Economic Projections seem consistent with one another and indicate an anticipated lift-off sometime near the middle of next year.\n\n2The floor has been more solid since the testing was extended in January for a full year. In part, this is likely because the extension allowed market participants to plan ahead knowing that they could rely on the facility. Raising the caps has also been a factor in solidifying the floor."

    "content": "Good morning and thank you for inviting me to your Annual Operations Conference.  This event brings together an important cross-section of market participants\u2014and looking at the attendance, I think there is good representation of nearly every important part of the financial system in the audience.  Today, I am going to talk about the progress that the industry has made to address weaknesses identified through the financial crisis and to build resilience to future shocks. I will also offer some observations on areas of remaining challenges, particularly as we focus on the interconnections between and among various market participants.  As always, my remarks today reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that it\u2019s been over five years since the onset of the worst part of the financial crisis\u2014and I\u2019m not sure whether it feels longer or shorter than that!  But one thing I\u2019m certain of is that a lot has changed in those five years, including fundamental changes in rules and regulations, as well as substantive changes in how firms and the system are structured and operate. All of these changes have been designed to achieve a stronger, and more stable, financial system.  I think it\u2019s fair to say that the financial crisis made it very clear to all of us that stability was about more than just banks.  It is also about the safety and soundness of a variety of interconnected\u2014and oftentimes large\u2014financial firms, regardless of charter or organizational type.  Post-crisis, we have a much keener appreciation of how financial stability is dependent on both strong financial institutions and on the soundness of the connections and linkages between and across firms, whether those connections are other firms, financial utilities, or even the phone company. \n\nRecognizing these connections, the Dodd-Frank Act expanded the Federal Reserve\u2019s authority for supervision. We now supervise a broader range of financial institutions than we did pre-crisis, like insurance companies, savings and loan holding companies and some market utilities.  In the remainder of my remarks, I will discuss both the progress made and the remaining challenges for the firms we supervise in the context of three key overarching principles of our supervisory framework:\n\nResiliency\n\nMuch has been said about the U.S. and international set of regulatory reforms aimed at making global banking organizations more resilient\u2014particularly in the areas of capital and liquidity.  The importance of robust capital requirements for financial stability and the serious shortcomings of the pre-crisis regulatory capital regime have been well documented.  A lot of work has been done on the capital front through a range of both domestic and international efforts.  These efforts have addressed\u2014in most cases\u2014both the quantitative and qualitative elements of capital, and have also addressed the important management processes around capital.\n\nThe Basel standards\u2014and resulting U.S. regulation\u2014address both the quantity and quality of capital and raise the bar on both elements for large firms.  As well, the new capital rules will also require a capital buffer that increases with a firm\u2019s size, complexity, interconnectedness and global footprint.  Implementation of these new standards should significantly increase the safety and soundness of the financial system.  And, to date, many of the largest firms have considerably improved their capital levels and capital planning processes.\n\nSimply addressing the quantity of capital and the quality of the planning processes isn\u2019t enough, though. And without elaborating too much on something I\u2019m sure you are quite familiar with, the reasons include:\n\nThus, supervisory and risk management tools need to expand to include stress testing\u2014and from this came the supervisory stress test and resulting Federal Reserve Capital Rule and the requirements in Dodd-Frank for stress testing.\n\nI think it\u2019s fair to say that the new capital rules will and should change how firms think about risk within their organizations.  Whether it\u2019s the increases in risk weights of certain types of exposures, or the overall imposition of leverage constraints, the new capital rules are designed to build a more resilient financial system that is better prepared to handle and weather the next crisis.\n\nThe capital requirements for large banks are supplemented by a liquidity framework.  Thinking back to the financial crisis it\u2019s fairly clear from the experiences of most firms during that period of time that liquidity was essential in survival.  Those firms that didn\u2019t have sufficient liquidity suffered greatly.  Here, too, the Basel Committee has played an important role in developing and implementing an internationally-agreed-to-framework for enhancing liquidity across large international firms.  The new framework currently includes a short-term requirement\u2014the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and discussions are underway to include a longer-term requirement\u2014the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). \n\nWhile capital and liquidity rules for large financial institutions are in the process of being implemented\u2014and significant progress has already been made in bolstering levels of both capital and liquidity in banking organizations\u2014there are still areas within the financial system where additional focus on building resilience continues to evolve.  In particular, enhanced risk management standards for financial market utilities have been adopted by international standard setters and, in the U.S., the agencies have recently proposed new rules to adopt these standards for U.S. firms. \n\nAmong these new standards are expectations that financial market utilities, including those that act as central counterparties (CCPs), be more resilient to shocks\u2014with a particular focus on enhancing liquidity and liquidity risk management.  While CCPs reduce aggregate risk, they also concentrate the remaining risk.  That is, CCPs create potential single points of failure in global derivatives markets.  Thus, CCPs need adequate capacity to absorb potential losses from the default of one or more of its members, and they need to have access to liquidity so that they can always fully settle their obligations. \n\nThe new risk management standards include requirements that CCPs have pre-funded default arrangements, that CCPs measure and collect initial and variation margin even in extreme stress scenarios, and that CCPs be able to withstand, again in a plausible stress scenario, the failure of a member having the largest exposure to the CCP.  In some cases, this last element is enhanced to require the ability to withstand the failure of the two largest members. \n\nAs these standards are fairly new for the global population of financial market utilities and in many jurisdictions the standards have yet to be issued in new rules and regulations, progress across the industry in meeting these standards is mixed. \n\nBeyond liquidity, additional work is needed in the area of capital planning.  While this is not an area that financial market utilities have spent considerable time and resources on in the past, it is an area we will continue to focus on in our reviews and expect continued development and improvement over the coming year.\n\nAs the industry continues to build resilience to future shocks, by enhancing the management of and the amount of capital and liquidity, as two important elements of resilience, the financial system will continue to grow stronger.  It\u2019s essential, though, that all parts of the financial system\u2014banks, non-bank financial firms, market utilities\u2014achieve enhanced resilience.  Simply having one part of the system robust to future shocks, with other parts\u2014connected and linked within the system\u2014less robust, leaves the system vulnerable to future shocks and instability.  \n\nManagement\n\nI\u2019d like to turn now to the second element of our supervisory framework: management.   In addition to our focus on resiliency as an essential element in strengthening the financial system, we see enhanced risk management and corporate governance as a complement to resiliency and necessary to achieve stronger firms and a stronger system.  As I know you are well aware, there has been renewed attention on the importance of effective corporate governance across the industry.  The debate includes examining the merits of familiar structures and practices of corporate governance and increasingly has focused on the corporate cultures of financial institutions.\n\nIn this regard, I\u2019d offer that the themes we see across the industry are fairly common.  That is, both recognition of the issues and progress in addressing outstanding challenges are resident in all types of institutions, whether banks, non-banks or market utilities.  To start, I\u2019ll touch on two elements in particular: risk culture and roles and responsibilities of boards of directors.\n\nIn November of last year, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) released a framework for assessing risk culture at financial firms.  The FSB\u2019s consultative document is set out as guidance for supervisory interaction with firms on risk culture.  It effectively outlines the basic elements\u2014the \u201cmust haves\u201d or conditions necessary\u2014for a firm to have a strong culture.   It provides guidance for supervisors (and, in turn, for firms) in identifying practices and behaviors that can be indicators of a firm\u2019s risk culture.  And, for each area, the paper provides a set of indicators that can be used to assess where the firm is on the spectrum. \n\nTo highlight those areas:\n\nSupervision in this area involves an assessment of the effectiveness of a financial institution\u2019s governance, including the extent to which the board and senior management demonstrate effective behaviors that contribute to good governance.  This includes consideration of the behavioral dynamics of the board and senior management, such as how the \u201ctone at the top\u201d and the cultural values of a bank are communicated and put into practice, how information flows to and from the board and senior management, and how potentially serious problems are identified and addressed throughout the organization. \n\nI think the FSB\u2019s document sets out a good set of reference points for supervisors\u2014and for firms\u2014to explore in evaluating risk culture.  As has been noted by others\u2014and is emphasized in the FSB\u2019s guidance\u2014assessing culture is not a single point in time event.  It should be a regular and ongoing exercise that management teams, boards of directors and supervisors conduct, taking the range of feedback from interactions and work conducted inside the firm, interactions and reactions from the firm\u2019s senior management team, and interactions and dialogue with the board of directors.\n\nAlongside risk culture, much work has been done on the roles and responsibilities of boards of directors.  The G30 has issued two reports in the last two years.  The first report, issued in 2012, set out fresh ways to describe and develop more effective governance at financial institutions.  The second report, issued late in 2013, deals specifically with the interactions of boards of directors and supervisors.  Both reports place less emphasis on the form of corporate governance\u2014the traditional structures of boards and the like\u2014and focus more on the actual behaviors of the various players involved, be it the chairman, the lead director, the chief risk officer, auditors or senior management. \n\nThe 2013 report proposes a new kind of relationship, one that involves far more direct contact and ongoing dialogue between directors and supervisors about the key issues confronting firms and the financial system, such as assessing financial institution strategies, business models, risk vulnerabilities, governance effectiveness and corporate culture. \n\nThe Federal Reserve has growing experience in this area.  Nearly three years ago, the New York Fed initiated a program of \u201cenhanced engagement\u201d with directors and senior management at the major firms we supervise, very much along the lines now described in the G30 report.  We provided additional training for our senior supervisory officers concerning corporate governance and relationship-building with boards, key directors and senior managers.  We also gave direction on how to focus their interactions on the most important supervisory matters, particularly with respect to the firm\u2019s risk profile and risk management practices.  We also reached out to board chairmen and chief executive officers to enlist their cooperation and support.\n\nThis has required everyone involved to step up to the plate in a new way.  For our senior supervisors, it has meant taking a higher-level and more encompassing view of the potential problems that a firm might encounter and, when necessary, delivering clearer and more timely supervisory messages and guidance to the firm.  For directors and senior managers, it has meant a shift toward greater openness and increased candor with supervisors about the condition of the firm, its business strategies and risks, and the issues that they are most concerned about.  It has also required devoting more time and attention to their relationship with supervisors. \n\nAfter three years, I can report steady progress from both sides at reaching the \u201cnew paradigm\u201d discussed in the G30 Report\u2014but there\u2019s still more to do.   As I said a moment ago, much of the focus of the recent G30 reports has been on behaviors and firm cultures.  It is right that these topics should be on the top of all our agendas.  Five years after the crisis, headlines about bad actors and corrosive corporate environments continue to be all too common. \n\nSo, my first observation about progress is just that\u2014the topics of culture and behavior are \u201ctop of mind\u201d for many senior management teams and boards of directors.  It\u2019s an important step to acknowledge that we have an issue.  My second observation is that this is a difficult topic, one that generates very heated discussions, but one that is necessary as the industry tries to tackle the complex issue of what can be done to restore public faith in the financial industry.  This begins with questions like:\n\nThis is a topic that we will surely revisit a number of times over the coming months as both the industry and the supervisory community begin to answer some of the tougher questions.  \n\nComplexity\n\nLet me now turn to the third element of the supervisory framework: reducing complexity.  In large measure, this translates into sound recovery and resolution planning.  The development and implementation of a credible resolution mechanism for large, global banks is a must.  By credible, I mean that if a failure of one of these financial institutions arises, then home authorities will proceed with the resolution plan, rather than intervene to prevent a failure.  Although the specifics of the resolution mechanisms will necessarily vary to some extent across jurisdictions, the goal is common: to be able to resolve any large, global firm regardless of its home jurisdiction without taxpayer funds and in a way that minimizes the knock-on effect to financial markets and other financial institutions. \n\nIn the area of recovery and resolution, I\u2019d again offer that some good progress has been made by many of the banking organizations, although the remaining challenges are quite daunting.  And, for the most part, this area is a new one for the other parts of the financial system, such as financial market utilities (FMUs), so the thinking is still evolving. \n\nFirms have made good progress in better understanding the complexity of their own operations, including strengthening the overall management of organizational/legal structures, identifying all legal entities (and this was huge for some firms), and beginning the difficult task of identifying additional impediments to resolving a large internationally active firm.  In some cases, firms have already begun the daunting task of simplifying their organizational and legal entity structures\u2014with an eye to being less complicated and easier to understand\u2014and resolve\u2014should the need arise.\n\nAlthough there has been progress, there is still quite a bit of work to do.  Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve issued guidance for the largest firms that outlined five \u201ccapabilities\u201d that should be at the top of the list of \u201cto dos\u201d:\n\nWhile there are many other areas that supervisors/regulators and legislators need to continue to work on to make cross-border resolution a reality, these five areas are ones that we have highlighted for near-term focus by firms.\n\nAnother important element to preventing the failure of a firm is ensuring that firms can respond to any weakness by having recovery plans that are implemented well before resolution becomes necessary.   Such recovery plans should:\n\nFor some types of firms\u2014like financial market utilities, recovery planning is actually an even more important issue.  Because FMUs provide critical services to the industry, experiencing a major disruption that could lead to resolution\u2014or dissolution\u2014is unacceptable.  It is important, then, that a CCP be structured in a way, and develop and have tools available, to enable it to recover from losses and continue operations under extreme scenarios.  Simply put, the debate on \u2018less complex\u2019 for financial market utilities is much more about recovery than it is about resolution.   Steadfast resiliency may include casting a more critical eye on the resources needed for a single CCP to withstand a plausible, severe shock.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile there is still work that needs to be done to make financial institutions more resilient, better managed and less complex, we have also made a great deal of progress.  I\u2019d like to close my remarks by highlighting some of the practical steps we are taking on the supervisory side to continue that progress. \n\nThank you for your attention today.  I would be happy to answer a few questions."

    "content": "It is a pleasure to speak at this program on global banks.  Since your agenda covers many dimensions of transformation and adaptation of global financial institutions, I thought I\u2019d frame my remarks around the theme of reform in a time of rapid change.  Change involves both long-wave and short-wave components.  Reform can be driven by both the public and the private sectors.  My thesis is that the most effective reform involves both the public and private sectors and takes account of both the proximate needs for reform and the long-term trends that drive long-term transformation.  The views I will express are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System. \n\nLet me highlight two kinds of change.  So much of the immediate regulatory agenda has been framed around addressing the failings in the run-up to the global financial crisis\u2014the failings as we understand them today.  The resulting lessons learned often focus on developments between 2003 and 2007: poor underwriting in the U.S. residential mortgage market, the rapid expansion of leverage in the household and the financial sectors, and the packaging and repackaging of risks from mortgages into increasingly complicated securities. \n\nAlongside those immediate forces driving reform, I want to highlight a second kind of change\u2014the no less major impetus for transformation in the financial services business that stems from larger macroeconomic and technological change.  As we think about public sector and private sector reform, I submit that we need to address and adapt to both types of change. \n\nWhat are some of those longer run forces that have been transforming the financial system?  Let\u2019s start with two macroeconomic trends that reflect the result of successes in global economic policy.  One is the rapid rise in wealth in much of the world and with it, new or greatly expanded institutions to concentrate and manage that wealth.  The function of the banking system in the 19th and early 20th century was to intermediate scarce capital on one side and a large supply of ambitious projects on the other, projects such as the building of the transcontinental railroad.  By contrast, today we live in a capital-rich world where the financial system\u2019s problem to solve is effective deployment of abundant capital, not gathering sufficient savings to meet capital needs. \n\nAnother long-run macroeconomic force has gathered substantial momentum in the last decade:  the shift of income, wealth and economic energy from the so-called advanced economies of the United States, Japan and Europe to the so-called emerging economies.  Ten years ago, the emerging market countries accounted for about 20 percent of world GDP\u2014the advanced economies 80 percent.  Today the proportion is 40/60, and the emerging market countries continue to grow substantially faster than the large advanced economies.  Yes, China is an important component of that growth, but the trend reflects strong performance in recent years in many regions of the world outside the advanced economies.\n\nA further long-run force, seen as the most disruptive, is technology.  At one time, the financial system, perhaps until the 1970s or 1980s, played an important role in searching for savers/investors to contribute to financing those major investments.  Much of the work of identifying and linking the sources and the uses of funds has been facilitated or even taken over by technology\u2014just think of the ubiquity of trading platforms, screens, and financial news and,  beyond that, the increasing automation and artificial intelligence applied to credit evaluation, financial analysis, and trading activities. \n\nI mention these three long-run forces because the financial industry has been and still is adapting to these trends.  Indeed, the major transformation in the U.S. financial industry that occurred in the course of the 1980s and 1990s\u2014the development of over-the-counter derivatives markets, the shift toward a larger role for securities markets relative to banking markets\u2014was just such an adaptation to the long-run forces of change.  The shift reflected the growth of institutional wealth and the power of technology, ubiquitous information and expanded financial know-how. \n\nIn 1986, the derivatives markets were still nascent and securitization had just begun to spread outside the mortgage markets in the United States.  At that time, a task force of central bankers, the precursor to today\u2019s Committee of the Global Financial System, which reports to the Global Economy Meeting of 31 central bank governors, published a volume titled Recent Innovations in International Banking.1 The report was notable for being among the first to describe what was then a set of new financial instruments, such as over-the-counter derivatives and the expanded use of financial options.  The study noted the tremendous momentum behind the 1980s wave of financial innovation, the likelihood of those forces continuing, and the changes already occurring in the financial system, especially the shift of financial activities from traditional banking markets to securities and derivatives markets. \n\nThe really noteworthy aspect of the report is the study group\u2019s effort to identify\u2014really, anticipate\u2014the risks and concerns that could emerge in the transforming financial system.  In a section that anticipates current policy language with the cutting-edge title \u201cMacro-prudential policy,\u201d the report enumerates these concerns: \n\nPost 2008, these issues sound all too familiar, of course.\n\nOf particular note, the report stated that:\n\nThe recent financial crisis in many ways represented the realization of many of these concerns. Some observations:\n\nRegulatory Reform\n\nThe wave of regulatory reform, of course, corresponds to a considerable degree with the problems observable during the crisis.  Take, for example, solving the Too Big to Fail problem.  The regulatory and financial stability agenda being advanced by the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is intended both to reduce the probability that large, systemically important firms could fail and to mitigate the costs of their failure, should that occur.  Measures to raise both the quantity and quality of capital at the large, systemically important firms, known as G-SIFIs, such as Basel III and enhanced prudential standards, are aimed at reducing the probability of failure.  The work on recovery and resolution planning, as set out in the Key Attributes for Effective Resolution Regimes, a new global standard published in 2011, aims at mitigating the cost of failure by developing the institutional arrangements and concrete plans to place a failing G-SIFI into resolution.  These initiatives at the global level have been mirrored at the national level in many countries. \n\nI\u2019d draw special attention to stress testing in its role in reducing the probability of failure and to resolution planning in reducing failure\u2019s social cost, because both represent an important shift of focus for the supervisory community.  Both processes focus attention on the far adverse tail of the probability distribution of outcomes for a firm.  Technology, financial modeling, and risk management theory and practice have greatly expanded and enhanced the supervisors\u2019 ability to analyze and address those severe adverse outcomes. \n\nAnother part of the regulatory reform agenda addresses weaknesses in short-term funding markets.  Efforts here include seeking to reduce the reliance on intraday credit in the tri-party repo market, to strengthen risk management in the repo and other short-term funding markets, and to make progress toward developing a collateral liquidation mechanism to prevent fire sales of collateral in distressed markets.   Reforms also are being considered for money market mutual funds, where the inherent run risk in the event that a money market mutual fund \u201cbreaks the buck\u201d continues to be a significant vulnerability. \n\nYet a third set of initiatives in the reform agenda seeks to strengthen the clearance and settlement infrastructure for over the counter derivatives.  In addition to creating incentives to move derivative transactions into trade repositories and central counterparties, which provide the benefits of risk management mechanisms and encouragement of standardization of contract terms, the reform efforts extend to improving the international legal framework for derivatives transactions in the event of default and failure or resolution. \n\nRegulatory reform can create guardrails for the financial system, but in my view, those reforms are far more effective if accompanied by similar reform efforts in the private sector.  Private sector reform can take the form of enhancing internal governance, re-evaluating strategy and business models, and strengthening risk management and internal controls within individual firms.  It can also take the form of industry collective action to improve market structure and practice, to invest in financial infrastructure and to recommend best practices.  In the U.S., the combination of public sector\u2014and private sector\u2014driven reform has historically played an important role in our financial system and should play a role today. \n\nI experienced the interplay of public and private sector efforts in the early 1990s, in the wake of the commercial real estate and leveraged buyout downturn in the US Northeast.  In the public sector, the supervisors pursued an aggressive program of remediation for troubled banks with three major elements.  Because the problems at that time were simpler, the remediation program imposed by supervisors was easy to understand and it was effective.  The three principal actions were:  a troubled bank had to raise additional capital and strengthen its liquidity; it needed to fully identify its problem assets and exposures, isolate them and place them in workout; and it needed to develop a new business plan.\n\nAt the same time, Congress passed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act, otherwise known as FDICIA in 1992; for its time, it contained a large number of provisions to guide supervisory and market practice.  Its lasting contributions were the prompt corrective action framework escalating the intensity of supervision as capital levels fall in a bank culminating in the ability to close banks before capital is fully depleted and a management attestation about the quality of internal controls that foreshadowed Sarbanes-Oxley.  Today, however, much of FDICIA has been forgotten.\n\nThe reason?  At many financial firms, bankers struck the theme of \u201cnever again.\u201d That conviction spurred them to identify lessons learned and institute stronger controls on commercial real estate lending and buyout lending and maintain them.  One sign that the effort mattered appeared as the commercial real estate market heated up later in the 1990s and lending terms started to loosen.  Deal flow came to a near-standstill as the controls established in the early 1990s kicked in.  The market only resumed when underwriting standards retraced their way back to higher ground. \n\nSo, as we benchmark progress in the recovery of financial institutions from the recent financial crisis, one area stands out.  The early 1990s supervisory program comprised strengthening capital and liquidity, identifying problem exposures and placing them in workout, and developing a new business plan\u2014there is one area where more progress will need to be made.  The international community of supervisors has done a great deal to address the need for more and better quality capital through new capital standards.  The identification and workout of troubled assets has made significant progress, which we can observe in the recovery of markets for some troubled assets.  But global financial firms are still working on the new business plan.  From the financial press, it\u2019s clear that many large financial companies have been rethinking their strategies, often along the lines of increasing the focus on nonfinancial businesses and households and reducing the focus on expanding capital markets businesses.  But I believe we are more at the beginning than toward the end of that process of reconsideration.\n\nIn my personal view, the reconsideration of business plans needs to incorporate the long-term macroeconomic and technology trends even as they incorporate the lessons learned from the financial crisis.  Those business plans need to look ahead five years or more to position the financial firms and, with them, the financial system for the opportunities and risks that lie ahead.  We will need to meet the long-term challenges of changes in the global macroeconomy, the distribution of growth opportunities and the distribution of wealth, and the speed and power of technological change. \n\nSince so much opportunity has developed elsewhere in the world, how will the public sector reform agenda impact the global banking activities of financial institutions?  We do not know yet how the reform agenda will affect the international activities of G-SIFIs, although we can see some early indications.  Higher capital requirements and more stringent prudential standards are causing some firms to re-examine their correspondent and business relationships and make new cost-benefit assessments.  The greater focus on stress testing and resolution planning may lead to more discussion of firm structure, including the number of subsidiaries, the alignment of the corporate structure with the firm\u2019s business activities, the management of intragroup exposures, the use of parent guarantees, and the correlation of the firm\u2019s capital and liquidity structure with the firm\u2019s business and legal entity structure. \n\nIn my personal view, discussion will no doubt lead to action, in the best scenario, by the large, systemically important financial firms themselves.  The issues reflect areas where the true costs of managing a large, complex, internationally active firm have not yet been fully internalized by the firms.  Said differently, the cost of international financial activity has probably been too low, and as it rises, some readjustment of those activities will be necessary. \n\nThe forces of change continue strong, as strong as they were in the peak years of innovation more than 25 years ago.  Now, as then, financial institutions will need to adapt and transform themselves.  This time, however, we have the sobering experiences of the financial crisis to guide us.  We all have an interest in moving forward, given the pace of change in the world and in technology. \n\nThank you for your attention. \n\n1 Recent innovations in international banking (Cross Report)."

    "content": "The scaling back of the Federal Reserve\u2019s asset purchase program\u2014both the prospect and the actuality\u2014has created significant challenges for many emerging market economies. Although this shift in U.S. monetary policy was inevitable at some point, it seems to have triggered a broad-based sentiment shift in global markets.  Recent events are a reminder that U.S. monetary policy can have powerful effects abroad. What lessons should we draw from these events?   That will be the general theme of my brief remarks today.  \n\nBefore I go on, though, I first would remind you that the thoughts I offer today are my own, and should not be interpreted as representing the position of the Federal Reserve System.  I also want to call attention to Terry Checki, who is being honored today and has been at the center of events in global finance for more than three decades, and who has done so much to shape them.  I can't think of a better way of recognizing his many contributions\u2014and kicking off what I know will be an exciting and fulfilling next stage of his career\u2014than this roundtable which brings us together here today. \n\nLet me begin by highlighting some of the key points I will be making. \n\nFirst, what we've seen recently is not new.  Changes in Fed policy, and especially moves in the past to tighten monetary policy, have often created challenges for emerging market economies (EMEs).  Second, these countries, as a group, are better equipped today to handle those challenges than at perhaps any time in the past.  This reflects the fundamental improvements and stronger policy frameworks that many emerging market economies have put in place over the past 15 years.  Third, given the role of the dollar as the global reserve currency, the Federal Reserve has a special responsibility to manage policy in a way that helps promote global financial stability.  Fourth, I believe we need better international mechanisms to cushion the adjustment process for when capital flows abruptly change direction.  \n\nLike other central banks, our monetary policy mandate is domestic.  But, our actions often have global implications that feed back into the U.S. economy, and we need to always keep this in mind.  We also need to be careful not to underestimate the consequences of our actions.  Focusing only on direct channels, the effects that one would expect to ripple back to the United States from problems in one or two EMEs typically look quite small.  But, when all of the indirect channels of feedback are aggregated properly\u2014which admittedly is difficult to do\u2014the effects may be considerably larger.   My point is that we tend to underestimate these feedback effects. \n\nFor most of us, the market volatility of this past spring and summer still remains fresh in our minds.  EME financial markets were hit hardest, with declines in equity prices, a widening in sovereign debt spreads, and a sharp increase in foreign exchange rate volatility.  In the U.S., we saw a spike in Treasury yields, with 10-year rates rising by roughly 100 basis points from early May to early July, and rising by roughly another 30 basis points before peaking in early September. \n\nMost commentary has focused on the shift in expectations with respect to U.S. monetary policy\u2014and, in particular, to uncertainty about the timing and implications of Fed tapering\u2014as the catalyst for these moves.  This focus seems generally right, although other factors also played a role.  Market participants also had to evaluate the possibility that growth in China and other EMEs might be slowing even as growth in the U.S. and other advanced economies was picking up.  The subsequent market movements as investors withdrew funds from EME investments were an abrupt shock for EMEs generally, especially after the long earlier period of abundant liquidity and ample inflows. \n\nFrom one perspective, the unconventional nature of recent U.S. monetary policy adds little that is fundamentally new to the challenges now facing EMEs.  These policies simply represent a way of easing, driven by our coming up against the zero lower bound.   Central bankers have managed differences across countries in cyclical positions and policy stances many times in the past.  But, from another perspective, we have less experience operating with unconventional monetary policy and this creates more potential uncertainties.  This puts a premium on continued dialogue among central bankers, between central bankers and the market, and keen listening skills on our part.  In my view, the fact that our large scale asset purchase programs affect the size of term risk premia globally is important.  This set of monetary policies affects financial asset prices in a different way compared to changes in short-term interest rates, and we should be humble about what we claim about understanding the importance of this distinction. \n\nFor the period ahead, it seems likely that markets will remain focused on vulnerabilities they might have ignored a year ago.  The greater premium on strong fundamentals, policy coherence and predictability will likely remain.  There will be no one right answer in managing the trade-offs that come with the changed environment, and adjustment will sometimes be difficult.  Moreover, we will undoubtedly experience further bumps in the road.  The renewed volatility we saw in January is proof enough of that.  Yet, I think we can remain generally optimistic on the outlook so long as market participants continue to appropriately discriminate across countries, rather than treating EMEs as a homogenous group. \n\nFurthermore, many EMEs generally appear better equipped today to handle the Fed's prospective exit from its exceptional policy accommodation than they were in past tightening cycles.  This reflects the fundamental reforms these EMEs have put in place over the past 15 years, as well as the hard lessons learned from past periods of market stress.  Among the positives are:\n\nOf course progress has not been uniform across EMEs and more work remains to strengthen institutional structures further in some countries.  In particular, vulnerabilities have built up recently in several important EMEs.  Still, the fundamental improvements I\u2019ve cited leave many EMEs better positioned than in the past to weather those times in the cycle when the external environment turns from welcoming to wary.\n\nThe impact that changes in Fed policy can have beyond our borders has led to calls for us to do more to internalize those impacts, or even that policymaking be internationally coordinated.  As I\u2019ve already noted, Fed policies have significant effects internationally, given the central place of U.S. markets in the global financial system and the dollar\u2019s status as the leading global reserve currency.  In pursuing our policy responsibilities, we seek to conduct policy transparently and based on clear principles.  We are mindful of the global effects of Fed policy.  Promoting growth and stability in the U.S., I believe, is the most important contribution we can make to growth and stability worldwide. \n\nThere is, of course, the argument that Fed policy has been too accommodative for too long, creating risks for financial stability worldwide.  Here, I think, it\u2019s important to consider carefully the counterfactual.  Would countries beyond our borders really have been better off with a weaker U.S. economy?  The fundamental issue is whether U.S. monetary policy has helped support our dual objectives of stable prices and maximum sustainable growth and whether this is consistent with a healthy global economy. \n\nMoreover, it is far from clear that explicitly coordinated policy would produce better outcomes for the global economy generally, or the EMEs specifically.  Central banks have challenges enough in tailoring policies to their domestic circumstances.  I believe that it would be taking on too much to attempt to collectively fashion policy in reference to global conditions.  Moreover, our last system of explicit coordination\u2014the system of fixed exchange rates under Bretton Woods\u2014broke down for a reason.  Monetary policy meant to suit everybody is likely in the end to suit nobody.  Similar considerations underlie the widespread move in the emerging world away from fixed exchange rate regimes.  Policymakers worldwide have learned that a framework capable of responding in a disciplined but flexible manner to changing domestic conditions works best over the long run.\n\nWhile explicit coordination looks neither feasible nor desirable, there is more that central banks in general, and the Fed in particular, could do to be better global stewards.  One thing recent events demonstrate is the importance of effective Fed communication.  It is clear in retrospect that our attempts last spring to provide guidance about the potential timing and pace of tapering confused market participants.  In particular, markets seemed to conflate tapering with monetary policy tightening and raised their expected paths for policy rates.  Lately, we seem to have done better:  markets now seem to understand that policy rates will likely remain exceptionally low for a considerable period of time even after tapering is completed. \n\nAs you know, we\u2019ve taken a number of steps in recent years to increase transparency and improve our communications.  This includes regular press conferences following Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings by the Fed chair; the publishing of growth and inflation forecasts of FOMC participants; and a concerted attempt to lay out the guideposts that the FOMC will look at to assess progress toward our mandate.  This last element, of course, goes along with our move to explicit forward guidance, as part of our efforts to provide stimulus at the zero lower bound.  We are, though, still learning how to more effectively communicate, especially given our new and expanded set of policy instruments. \n\nA second area in which we can and must do better is safeguarding financial stability.  Simply put, we failed to act either early enough or decisively enough to stem the credit excesses that spawned the financial crisis and the Great Recession.  The United States was not alone in this, but given our position in the global financial system, we especially should have done better.  We've taken important steps, reflecting both new legislative mandates and a broader effort to rethink our regulatory and supervisory framework.  Systemically important banking organizations must now hold amounts of capital and liquidity that are better aligned with their risk profiles, compensation schemes for these institutions will be more focused on rewarding long-term results and the official sector is making progress in solving the too-big-to-fail dilemma. \n\nAll of this remains very much a work in progress.  But, these efforts should help us to avoid repeating the mistakes of the recent past, and to take a more proactive stance toward mitigating potential future vulnerabilities.  Of course, we at the Fed are not alone here.  Since the recent financial crisis, central banks worldwide have been engaged in a broad rethinking of how better to fulfill their mandates. \n\nI also think there is another area we need to work on, an area where very little has been done to date.  We need to collectively devise a better international mechanism for facilitating adjustment when the direction of capital flows changes abruptly.  The current regime strikes me as inefficient and often ineffective.  Holding large cushions of foreign exchange reserves is expensive, drawing down those reserves is often unattractive because of the potential adverse signal that this sends, and EMEs are loath to turn to the International Monetary Fund for resources to cushion the adjustment process.  It seems to me that we could design a better global solution of collective insurance\u2014access to liquid resources in times of stress that were not stigmatized and that could and would be used to facilitate adjustment.  This could help reduce market volatility and dampen the size of foreign exchange and other adjustments.  This is a topic, in my opinion, that deserves greater attention from central bankers around the world. \n\nLet me close with a final thought.  The largest problems that countries create for others often emanate from getting policy wrong domestically.  Recession or instability at home is often quickly exported.  Equally important, growth and stability abroad makes all our jobs easier.  This means that there are externalities in the work we do, so that more effective fulfillment of our domestic mandates helps to bring us to a better place collectively.  Ensuring global growth and stability is and will remain our joint and common endeavor.  This is what Terry Checki has worked for over his distinguished career.  We have been very fortunate for his service and must carry the mantle forward."

    "content": "Good afternoon and thank you for inviting me.  It is always a pleasure to speak with the different communities that make up our region, and it is especially gratifying to have the opportunity to talk with you, our future leaders. \n\nI am especially pleased to be here at Brooklyn College, given the relationship that we at the New York Fed have developed with The City University of New York (CUNY). As an example, we collaborated this year on the College Fed Challenge, our yearly competition where teams of students from area universities take on the roles of the members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and debate the appropriate next steps for U.S. monetary policy.  A number of CUNY schools competed and professors served as judges. Also, several CUNY schools had a strong showing in our annual Savvy Credit Video Festival which I\u2019ll speak more about later. \n\nMy meeting with you today is part of our continuing efforts to understand what is going on at the grassroots level of our economy and to share what we are seeing.  At the Federal Reserve, we try to meet with a diverse array of people in order to get a comprehensive picture of economic conditions in the regions we serve and a fuller understanding of the major issues.  Earlier today, I met with developers and local community leaders to learn about the redevelopment of the Atlantic Yards, was welcomed to a roundtable breakfast meeting with members of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce and then traveled to Brownsville to learn about the challenges faced by that community.  Following this visit to Brooklyn College, I\u2019m headed to Bush Terminal in Sunset Park to meet with city officials and learn about an important redevelopment project and then I\u2019ll end the day at Etsy\u2014a successful innovative start-up and a major private-sector employer here in Brooklyn. \n\nThese trips are only one of the many ways in which we seek to engage with the people and businesses in our region.  We also reach out to our local communities through web resources, workshops and conferences.  To assess the performance of the regional economy, we monitor economic activity on a monthly basis, we tap into the insights of the members of our Small Business and Agriculture Advisory Council and Upstate Advisory Board, and we have constructed a consumer credit panel that allows us to better understand the financial condition of homeowners and students at the local level.  We conduct two monthly surveys\u2014the Empire State Manufacturing Survey and the Business Leaders Survey of service firms\u2014which help us monitor regional business conditions in close to real-time. We\u2019ve also developed a \u201cRegional Mortgage Conditions\u201d analysis at the county and zip code level.  In addition, we conduct a biannual poll of small businesses to understand their credit needs and availability.  It is noteworthy that our most recent poll found that cash flow issues replaced credit availability as the number one concern of small companies. \n\nWe also have worked to support better financial decision-making by young consumers.  Every year the Bank conducts two competitions in which college students are challenged to produce a 30-second video promoting wise credit use.  The two contests, one held in Puerto Rico and the other in the tri-state region, provide students the opportunity to learn about the importance of personal finance while showcasing their filmmaking creativity.  The winning video is then shown at numerous local movie theaters, helping promote the value of the smart use of credit.  This year the judges, including Maria Bartiromo from Fox Business, Tamir Muhammad from the Tribeca Film Institute and Jim Rosenberg from UNICEF, selected a Brooklyn College entry, entitled \u201cElevate Your Credit\u201d as the winner.  I am pleased to again congratulate Rasa Partin, Ben Remetz and Andrew Roder, and their coach, Jay Kim, for creating the winning video. \n\nNow I would like to review recent developments in the local and national economies, and at the end of my talk will be happy to answer any questions you have. \n\nAs always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee. \n\nRegional Employment and Economic Trends\n\nFirst, let\u2019s talk about economic trends in New York City. The City\u2019s economy showed resilience both during and after this last severe recession.  Payroll employment fell sharply in 2008 and 2009; it bounced back, slowly at first, but by July of 2011, the City\u2019s economy had recovered to its pre-recession employment peak and, in November, it eclipsed its previous all-time peak of 1969.  Since then, employment has continued to grow strongly, rising at a roughly 2 percent annual pace and outpacing the national growth rate.  The demand for labor has been driven by start-ups, tech, health care and business services.  While Superstorm Sandy caused substantial damage to homes and the region\u2019s infrastructure and severe economic disruptions in late 2012, the local economy as a whole bounced back quickly.  \n\nDespite the robust job growth, the unemployment rate among City residents has been persistently high\u2014though it did fall to 8.0 percent in December, nearly a 5-year low.  Potential workers are not counted as unemployed unless they are actively looking for work, so this relatively high rate of unemployment, in part, reflects the relative strength in labor force participation, as the City\u2019s residents remain engaged and looking for work.  In contrast, at the national level, the picture is quite different\u2014job growth has been slower and proportionately more people have dropped out of the labor force.  \n\nPerhaps surprisingly, while historically a key driver of the local economy, the finance sector has not been a leader in terms of job growth recently.  Instead, employment in New York City\u2019s finance sector and the securities industry specifically, has been essentially flat over the past two years.  The city\u2019s job gains in this expansion have been broad-based across other sectors, indicating a healthy diversification within the economy. \n\nConditions in Brooklyn\n\nNow let\u2019s focus on Brooklyn. The borough\u2019s economy has been particularly strong in recent years.  Compared with the other boroughs, Brooklyn has seen generally stronger job growth, a stronger housing market, and stronger trends in wage and salary earnings.  This strength is exemplified by the transformation of industrial neighborhoods\u2014such as DUMBO, Red Hook, Greenpoint, East Williamsburg, Gowanus and Bushwick\u2014into increasingly diversified residential and commercial neighborhoods; and the recent development of the Atlantic Yards and Brooklyn Navy Yard.  This changing landscape has helped spur economic activity which has created many new jobs in the borough. \n\nIndeed, employment held up well during the recession, declining by less than 2 percent over a brief period in early 2009, and has averaged a nearly 3 percent annualized growth rate since then.  Job growth has been particularly strong at retailers, hotels and restaurants, and also service firms ranging from advertising to engineering.  That said, the employment picture does have some difficulties.  For example, there is concern over some well-paying health sector jobs given the financial strain at Long Island College Hospital and Interfaith Medical Center and the pressure to close those institutions. \n\nBrooklyn\u2019s economic vitality is also reflected in the commercial real estate market, as both office and retail vacancy rates have fallen steadily over the past few years.  In fact, office vacancy rates are now lower in Brooklyn than in Manhattan.  The strength in the housing market is also evident, with the median home price up by roughly 10 percent in each of the past two years, and the rental market has shown similar strength.  \n\nHowever, these increasing prices also raise two other issues that acutely afflict many in Brooklyn and New York City more broadly: housing affordability and poverty.  Despite Brooklyn\u2019s economic renaissance and growing affluence, a large swath of the Borough\u2019s population\u2014one in four residents\u2014still lives in poverty, and many struggle to pay their rent or mortgage.  Even with the strong pace of job creation, Brooklyn\u2019s unemployment rate has remained high, averaging more than 9 percent in 2013.  \n\nThere are also continued financial challenges for families here as indicated by the New York Fed\u2019s measures of credit conditions.  As of the end of 2013, average debt per person was about $42,000 in Brooklyn\u2014little changed over several years.  At the same time, the Borough\u2019s delinquency rate on that debt is now 11.6 percent, much higher than the state average and more than double the national average.  What\u2019s more, the mortgage crisis continues to take a toll on local homeowners.  As of the end of 2013, more than 11 percent of mortgage debt in Brooklyn was 90-plus days delinquent, again significantly higher than the New York State and national delinquency rate. \n\nI also want to make a few comments about the impact of Superstorm Sandy.  While areas of the New York City metropolitan region were hard hit by the storm, the devastation was particularly severe along the waterfronts of Brooklyn\u2014and in particular in southern Brooklyn and neighborhoods like Red Hook.  We saw and heard about the devastation of the storm from many of those affected, including a number of our own employees as well as other residents we met at a series of assistance clinics we organized in response to the storm.  Those already living close to the edge financially were particularly vulnerable as were the City\u2019s public housing residents.  Still, Brooklyn\u2019s economy showed resilience: while employment did drop in November 2012, it bounced back strongly the next month and accelerated during the spring of 2013, reaching new highs. \n\nSandy was a catastrophe for many in our region and significant challenges remain in the years ahead.  Recently, the Federal Emergency Management Agency issued preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps that show a much larger number of Brooklyn residents and businesses at risk of a future storm.  While a once-in-a-hundred-year risk of flooding may not appear worrisome, many within this expanded zone may be required to purchase insurance.  The expanded flood zones, coupled with federal government efforts to have insurance premiums accurately reflect the risk, could create a serious affordability problem in the years ahead.  The New York Fed has created maps of community-level flood risk in Brooklyn.  \n\nNow I would like to turn my attention to recent developments in the national economy. \n\nNational Economic Conditions\n\nFrom the end of the Great Recession in mid-2009 through mid-2013, real Gross Domestic Product, or the aggregate value, after adjusting for inflation, of all the goods and services produced within the borders of the U.S., grew at a rather tepid 2 1/4; percent annual rate.  Then, in the second half of 2013, the pace of growth moved notably higher, reaching an annual rate of 3 1/4 percent.  Nonetheless, despite this pickup in the growth pace, the average monthly gains in nonfarm payroll employment were somewhat lower in the second half of the year compared to the first half.  \n\nAt the same time, both total and core inflation, as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) deflator, slowed in the second half of 2013 relative to the first half, and the overall PCE deflator index is currently running well below the FOMC\u2019s expressed goal of 2 percent for total inflation. \n\nCombined with the still-elevated unemployment rate and the drop in the labor force participation rate, these conditions suggest that there continues to be a substantial underutilization of both labor and capital resources.  This implies, in turn, that the current, highly-accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time to come.  Let me elaborate on these points. \n\nWhile the timing and magnitude of the pickup of growth were earlier and somewhat stronger than our internal forecast, in qualitative terms the economy has performed much as we expected.  First, by several measures, households\u2019 balance sheets are in much better shape, and this has led to faster growth of consumer spending, particularly for durable goods.  Key measures of household leverage have declined and are now near the lowest levels they have been in well over a decade.  Reflecting rising equity and home prices and declining debt, household net worth relative to disposable income has climbed back to its average of the previous decade.  Recently, banks have eased credit standards somewhat after a prolonged period of tightening.  In fact, our own Consumer Credit Panel, a representative sample of the liability side of the U.S. consumer balance sheet derived from consumer credit reports, indicates that total household liabilities increased last quarter on a year-over-year basis, the first rise since mid-2008. \n\nIn addition to the firming in consumer spending, growth of exports was quite strong over the second half of last year.  Following a few years of lackluster performance, growth among our major trading partners improved, providing a boost to employment and output in our manufacturing sector.  Moreover, the important advances made in oil drilling technology have boosted U.S. energy production, cutting oil imports and boosting petroleum product exports and this is also leading to steady improvement in our trade balance.  The economy also received an important boost from quite strong inventory accumulation, which added nearly a full percentage point to the annualized second half growth rate.  This inventory investment was broad-based across sectors and types of goods.  In fact, all four quarters of 2013 saw a positive growth contribution from inventory accumulation, something that typically only occurs as the economy first emerges from recession.  I interpret this as a sign of increased confidence about the economic outlook within the business community.  \n\nFinally, federal fiscal restraint lessened over the second half of 2013.  This is in sharp contrast to the first half of the year, when the payroll tax cut expired, tax rates on higher income households were raised, a series of taxes associated with the Affordable Care Act took effect, and spending was reduced due to the sequester and the gradual winding down of foreign military operations.  Moreover, the sustained contraction in spending and employment by state and local governments appears to be nearing an end.  \n\nI wish that I could report that the improved pace of growth of economic activity led to a corresponding increase in the rate of improvement in labor market conditions.  But such was not the case.  As I noted earlier, the average monthly change of nonfarm payroll employment over the second half of the year, at 184,000 per month, was somewhat below the 204,000 average monthly increase of the first half.  In addition, growth of aggregate hours worked by private sector employees was somewhat slower in the second half than in the first.  The source of this apparent anomaly is the fact that labor productivity, or output per hour worked, rose rapidly over the second half of the year after being essentially unchanged over the first half.  This is a perfect example of the double-edged sword of productivity growth.  In the long-run, sustained strong productivity growth is what boosts real living standards.  However, in the short-run it can depress job creation.  \n\nWhile overall labor market indicators for the second half of 2013 were not particularly strong, the overall trend in unemployment showed some improvement with the unemployment rate falling sharply over that period, from 7.5 percent in June to 6.7 percent in December.  However, as has been the case since October of 2009 when the unemployment rate peaked at 10 percent, this decline in the unemployment rate was driven in large part by a decline in the labor force participation rate.  Much has been written about the forces that are causing this decline of the labor force participation rate.  Researchers have shown that the aging of the population is playing a role, as are changes in behavior.  But our own analysis suggests that the cyclical weakness of demand for labor is an important contributing factor.  As a result, I conclude that the decline of the unemployment rate significantly overstates the degree of improvement in the labor market.   \n\nLooking forward, I believe that the underlying fundamentals of the U.S. economy have improved to the point where we can expect sustained growth above the roughly 2 1/4 percent annual pace that prevailed from mid-2009 through mid-2013.  Also, the amount of fiscal drag continues to diminish.  Another good piece of news is that Congress has raised the debt ceiling until March 2015.  This lessens the risk that political brinkmanship in Washington could harm consumer and business confidence.   \n\nThat said, I expect that growth, over the near term, will slow somewhat from the pace we saw during the second half of last year.  In particular, during the current quarter, unusually cold and snowy weather will undoubtedly depress activity somewhat\u2014especially with respect to construction activity, but also to a lesser extent in areas such as retail spending.  Also, as mentioned above, some special, one-time factors, such as very rapid growth of exports and sustained inventory building, are unlikely to be repeated over the first half of this year.  Moreover, while there is now a much better balance between supply and demand in the housing market, that market is still adjusting to the roughly 100 basis point increase in mortgage interest rates that occurred in mid-2013. \n\nI do expect that growth will be strong enough to lead to continued improvement in labor market conditions.  I must caution, however, that the outlook for the unemployment rate is unusually uncertain.  If our assessment is correct, at some point an improving labor market should cause the labor force participation rate to stabilize or rise a bit as currently discouraged workers begin looking for work.  Such developments could result in a more muted rate of decline of the unemployment rate despite the faster growth. \n\nFinally, as the expansion continues, I expect inflation to gradually rise toward the FOMC\u2019s objective of 2 percent as measured by the PCE deflator.  This forecast is based on the projected gradual increase in the levels of resource utilization, a firming in global demand, and the upward pull exercised by stable inflation expectations on actual inflation.  Underpinning the latter assumption is the broad stability of long-term inflation expectations across different financial and survey measures, combined with ongoing moderate growth of wages and unit labor costs\u2014all observations consistent with anchored inflation expectations. \n\nOverall, I would characterize the outlook as reasonably favorable.  But I would very much prefer faster economic growth and more rapid progress towards our dual mandate objectives of maximum sustainable employment and price stability.  Hence, the continued need for monetary policy to remain highly accommodative to support the economic recovery to the fullest.   \n\nThank you for your kind attention and I will now be happy to take some questions."

    "content": "Good evening. It\u2019s a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak with you today on the subject of the economy, and especially the household sector. As is always the case, my remarks reflect my own opinions, not those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nNational Economic Conditions\n\nFrom the end of the Great Recession in mid-2009 through mid-2013, real gross domestic product (GDP), or the aggregate value, after adjusting for inflation, of all the goods and services produced within the borders of the United States, grew at a rather tepid 2 \u00bc percent annual rate.  Then, in the second half of 2013, the pace of growth moved up a full percentage point to around 3 \u00bc percent.\n\nRoughly half of this increase in the growth rate of real GDP stemmed from a strengthening of consumer spending. While I will discuss the factors behind this improvement in consumer spending in more detail in what follows, the main driver appears to be the substantial stabilization in household balance sheets that has occurred over the past few years.  Household net worth has rebounded from its levels after financial crisis and ensuing recession because of increases in asset values and decreases in liabilities. In fact, the financial obligation burden of the aggregate household sector, or long-term financial obligations expressed as a percentage of disposable income, is now the lowest it has been since the early 1980s.\n\nIn addition to the firming in consumer spending, growth of exports was quite strong over the second half of last year.  Following a few years of lackluster performance, economic growth among our major trading partners improved, providing a boost to employment and output in our manufacturing sector. In addition, a secular trend of increasing energy exports and declining energy imports is now providing steady improvement in our trade balance.  \n\nAnother contributing factor is that federal fiscal restraint lessened substantially over the second half of 2013.  This development is in sharp contrast to the first half of the year, when the payroll tax cut expired, tax rates on higher-income households were raised, a series of taxes associated with the Affordable Care Act took effect, and owing to the sequester and the gradual winding down of foreign military operations, federal spending was restrained.  Moreover, the sustained contraction in revenue, spending, and employment by state and local governments appears to be nearing an end.\n\nWhile overall labor market indicators for the second half of 2013 were not particularly strong, the unemployment rate did fall sharply over that period, from 7.5 percent in June to 6.6 percent in January of this year. However, as has been the case since October 2009 when the unemployment rate peaked at 10 percent, this decline in the unemployment rate was associated with an almost equal percentage point decline in the labor force participation rate. Much has been written about the forces that are causing this decline of the participation rate. Researchers have shown that the aging of the population is playing a role, as are changes in behavior. But our own analysis suggests that the cyclical weakness of demand for labor is an important contributing factor, and so we do not take as much comfort from the decline of the unemployment rate as we otherwise might.\n\nLooking forward, I believe that the underlying fundamentals of the U.S. economy have improved to the point where we can expect sustained growth above the recent pace of 2 1/4 percent.  That being said, I doubt that over the near term we will see growth as rapid as that in the second half of last year. Special, one-time factors, such as very rapid growth of exports and sustained inventory building, are unlikely to be repeated over the first half of this year. Moreover, while there is now a much better balance between supply and demand in the housing market, that market is still adjusting to the roughly 100 basis point increase in mortgage interest rates that occurred in mid-2013.\n\nFinally, with somewhat stronger growth of output, I expect inflation to gradually rise toward the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s objective of 2 percent as measured by the PCE deflator.   This forecast is based on the projected gradual increase in the levels of resource utilization, which would lessen downward pressure on firms\u2019 marginal costs and prices, a firming in global demand, and the continued upward pull exercised by stable inflation expectations on actual inflation.  Underpinning the latter assumption is the broad stability of long-term inflation expectations across different financial and survey measures, combined with ongoing moderate growth of wages and unit labor costs, all of which are consistent with well-anchored inflation expectations. \n\nAs mentioned above, the key development behind the firmer tone of consumer spending over the second half of 2013 is the significant strengthening in household balance sheets.  One aspect of that improvement is that from mid-2008 through mid-2013, total household liabilities declined significantly after a period of quite rapid debt growth over the preceding decade.  The reduction in household debt is an extremely rare event for the U.S. economy. In fact, this has been the only period of sustained declines in nominal household indebtedness over the period since the early 1950s. \n\nThe Household Sector\n\nIn the remainder of my remarks, I\u2019d like to focus on the finding, made public in our most recent Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit, that for the first time since 2008, households increased their borrowing on a year-over-year basis, at least in nominal terms.  I\u2019ll argue that this is an encouraging development, although we should be cautious both in predicting future borrowing and in recognizing that the aggregate increase in borrowing may mask the fact that many individual households remain constrained by prior borrowing and/or a reduction of income. These households are still engaged in attempting to reduce their debt burden by pay-downs in debt.  Furthermore, I\u2019ll explain how the type of borrowing by households has changed over time.  Here too there is a reason for some caution, because borrowing for education has become more common for U.S. households.  It appears that heavy student debt can restrain the consumption activity of those individuals who are burdened with it.  If this is the \u201cnew normal\u201d for the economy, it might result in delayed purchases of homes and autos for those graduates who finance their education by taking on large amounts of debt. This is a potential development that bears close monitoring.\n\nWhy do I suggest that an increase in household borrowing is an encouraging development?  While in recent years we have certainly seen that household debt can carry serious negative consequences, overall an increasing level of borrowing indicates that the economy is returning to normal patterns. After all, with rising GDP and an expanding population, we should not be surprised to see debt increasing, if only modestly. Of course, the kinds of debts that people are taking on and the riskiness of those loans\u2014to both the borrower and the lender\u2014are important issues, and I will return to them later in the talk.\n\nNow households borrow for a variety of reasons, but we can generalize to say that households borrow to smooth their consumption. For households whose incomes are temporarily low, perhaps because they are just starting their careers, borrowing makes it possible to enjoy today some of the consumption that would otherwise have to be delayed far into the future. Another aspect of consumption smoothing is borrowing to invest in durable goods or to make household investments, such as the purchase of autos and houses or the funding of higher education. By borrowing, households can avoid what otherwise might be severe and protracted reductions in their current consumption in order to make such investments. For example, without mortgages, households would have to delay purchasing a home until they had accumulated sufficient wealth to pay cash for the purchase, which for most would require draconian cuts to their other spending for years. Regardless of its motivation, the incurring of debt is predicated on expectations of the ability to repay through diversion of some portion of their future income. \n\nOnce acquired, however, debt can impose strains on households\u2019 finances if their future incomes do not accrue at the rate expected, or if the cost of servicing the debt rises unexpectedly.  These strains in household finances from suddenly excessive debt service burdens are met by households in a variety of ways: through default, foreclosures, and bankruptcy, or renegotiation of the terms of repayment, but also through continued higher principal and interest payments accompanied by much lower consumption than the household had previously planned.\n\nAs we see in Chart 1 (Employment declined dramatically) job losses in the recent recession were extremely large and prolonged, a problem that resulted, in part, in significant delinquencies in debt repayment. Furthermore, the significant decline in house values imposed a much stricter limit on how much households could borrow if they needed, for example, to adjust to the effects of a temporary loss of income. Recent economic research has examined how the macroeconomy is affected when households suddenly experience reduced borrowing capacity. Eggertsson and Krugman consider the case of households that have borrowed up to some limit and now see their debt limit reduced; these households suddenly find themselves over-indebted and are forced to cut spending.1  If the required cuts in spending are large enough, then even a very active monetary policy will be unable to offset them completely. Other research has also suggested similar mechanisms.  Hall has pointed out that a tighter household borrowing constraint can help explain the depth and persistence of the most recent recession in the U.S.2 Mian and Sufi observe that unemployment is much higher in counties across the U.S. where households were more debt constrained by the fall in the price of housing.3 Their finding provides further support for the hypothesis that it is the especially debt-constrained households that are under the greatest pressure to reduce current consumption.\n\nGiven the effect that sudden reductions in borrowing capacity are expected to have on broader economic activity, it is then encouraging to see that, at least at the aggregate level, households are increasing their borrowing. This suggests that the forced cuts in spending caused by declines in borrowing capacity are becoming less of a major concern for households. \n\nI\u2019d now like to turn to some of the empirical analysis that can help explain both the decline in aggregate U.S. borrowing after 2008 and the subsequent turnaround of this trend in 2013.\n\nFirst, as we now know all too well\u2014and as seen in Chart 2 (House Prices Peaked and Fell Precipitously), house prices in the U.S. rose at steadily increasing  rates from 2000 through 2006, followed by an approximately 31 percent reversal that persisted through 2011. That reversal reduced the aggregate wealth of homeowners and, in the worst case, left many \u201cunderwater,\u201d meaning that the amount of mortgage debt secured by their home exceeded its current value. This outcome is reflected in the dramatic decline in owners\u2019 equity in household real estate, seen in Chart 3 (Result was a Huge Decline in Owners\u2019 Equity in HH RE).  It is interesting to note that while home prices rose during the boom, homeowner\u2019s equity share remained constant. Thus, prior to the end of 2006, on average for each 1 percent increase in home prices, homeowners increased their mortgage debt by 1 percent (through higher balances on first mortgages, cash-out refinances, second mortgages, and home equity lines of credit). \n\nWhen house values began to fall, so did corporate equity values, which depressed household wealth further Chart 4 (Stock Market Wealth also Fell Sharply), limiting households\u2019 options for reducing their debt burdens or sustaining their prior levels of consumption. \n\nConsequently, and in line with the logic of the research I discussed earlier, U.S. households decreased the cash flow available for consumption by paying down debt during the recession and early recovery.  In Chart 5 (Four-quarter cash flow from borrowing) we measure the amount of borrowing\u2014both mortgage and nonmortgage borrowing\u2014that U.S. households were engaging in over time.  Consider that in 2007, households were receiving in aggregate $330 billion in cash from borrowing.  These funds were available for consumption expenditures or for household investments such as home improvements.  However, with their borrowing limits lowered as house values fell and income levels declined, households began to pay down debt rapidly.  (Of course, while many households acted to pay down debt, some debt was written off through foreclosures and bankruptcies, and other households were increasing debt by borrowing for home purchases, as normally would be the case.  But we exclude those kinds of transactions here.) In sum, however, households in 2010 actively reduced their net indebtedness by $150 billion.  The reversal in cash available for household expenditures was a massive $480 billion over the period from 2007 to 2010. This fact was established by Brown, Haughwout, Lee, and van der Klaauw in our Liberty Street Economics blog in 2011.4\n\nAllow me a brief digression here, because I think it touches on an important point. A lot of people refer to this pay-down of debt as \u201cdeleveraging,\u201d but in my view that\u2019s a misuse of the term. Since the distinction is more than just semantic, let me explain what I mean.\n\nFinancial leverage is usually thought of as a ratio. Consider a typical home purchase with 20 percent down. Here, the buyer makes a down payment equal to 20 percent of the asset value and borrows the other 80 percent of the purchase price in the form of a home mortgage. We would say that the borrower\u2019s leverage is 5 (the asset value divided by the equity share). Now, it\u2019s easy to see that reducing debt and reducing leverage are the same thing when asset values are constant. If the borrower in our example pays down half the mortgage and the house value doesn\u2019t change, her leverage has fallen to 2.5.\n\nUnfortunately, house values fell from 2007 to 2011. So while households were trying their best to reduce their mortgage debt, their leverage was actually rising, since house values were falling much faster than debt. It was really only in 2012 that leverage in residential real estate began to fall, because house prices stopped declining faster than housing debt. In 2013, leverage continued to fall, even though net mortgage borrowing resumed, because house values rose even faster.\n\nI think this distinction is important, because if we think that households have been steadily deleveraging since 2008 we might wonder whether we were getting close to the finish line. After all, the labor market has been recovering, albeit slowly, for several years. But in my view, the fact that households saw their leverage increasing in spite of their efforts to pay down debt helps explain why they kept at it. Households may well be trying to reestablish a more normal and sustainable leverage ratio. This view also underlines the importance of avoiding busts in house prices as a fundamental underpinning of a recovery in borrowing and consumption. \n\nIt is likely that these reductions in debt and new borrowing during the recession and the early part of the recovery stemmed from what we might label decreases in the demand for borrowing.  As households saw their wealth decline, especially the wealth represented by the value of their home, and as unemployment grew and remained elevated, households\u2019 capacity to repay debt declined, and, as a result, their desired stock of debt declined as well.  At the same time, banks too were suffering from heavy losses on mortgages and other lending, and reduced the supply of credit available to households.  We can see this in Chart 6 (Banks and Lenders Imposed Tighter Mortgage Lending Standards) which shows the sustained tightening of lending standards reported by banks starting in 2007. Furthermore, Chart 7 (Origination by Risk Score: First Mortgages) shows the percentage of prime first mortgage originations by the credit score of the borrower. The chart reveals a quite dramatic tightening of credit standards during 2008 and 2009. Here we see that the share of new mortgage borrowing by applicants of all credit scores below the highest quartile declined, while that of the highest quartile increased from about 40 percent to 70 percent. This suggests that lenders were far more selective in their underwriting standards for mortgages than they had been in the period between 2000 and 2006.  \n\nMany of these powerful forces of demand and supply that together led to the decline in household borrowing, and hence to the fall-off in resources available for consumption, have either diminished or slowly reversed as the economic recovery that began in 2009 has continued.  First, equity values, which dropped 51% between October 2007 and March  2009, as measured by the S&P 500 index, have recovered significantly, rising by almost 140% percent through the end of 2013 Chart 8 (Stock Market Wealth also Fell Sharply, 2nd half).   In addition, as seen in Chart 9 (House Prices Peaked and Fell Precipitously, 2nd half) house prices have finally begun to recover, and have been doing so on a broad geographical basis.  House prices are up 21 percent since their nadir in 2011.  This has helped restore owners\u2019 equity in their homes Chart 10 (Result was a huge decline in Owners\u2019 Equity in HH RE, 2nd half). In sum, as seen in Chart 11 (Household Net Worth), aggregate household wealth has recovered substantially as a percent of disposable income, albeit with a lesser contribution from housing and a greater contribution from corporate equities. \n\nAt roughly the same time, starting in 2011, we\u2019ve seen a substantial loosening in nonmortgage lending standards by banks, an important sign of normalization in credit markets, as Chart 12 (Standards have loosened since 2011 on non-mortgage products) suggests. Perhaps not surprisingly, mortgage standards have only in recent quarters begun very slowly to reverse the significant tightening that followed the housing bust; see Chart 13 (Banks and Lenders Imposed Tighter Mortgage Lending Standards, 2nd half).\n\nBroad increases in wealth, continued recovery in the overall economy with higher levels of employment and income, a relaxation of credit standards, and historically low interest rates have led to improvements in delinquency rates and increases in both demand and supply for borrowing by U.S. households.  In 2013, we see the consequent increase in household debt.   In the last quarter of 2013, aggregate consumer debt increased by $241 billion, the largest quarter-to-quarter increase since 2007. More importantly, as shown in Chart 14 (Total Debt Balance and Its Composition, in 2013 total household debt rose $180 billion, marking the first four-quarter increase in outstanding debt since 2008. This is at most the beginning of a turnaround, of course: for example, once we adjust for inflation, debt per capita has just barely stopped falling, as Chart 15 (Real Household Liabilities Per Capita) suggests.\n\nFurther analysis based on our Consumer Credit Panel shows that the growth rates in auto and student loan borrowing have been positive for some time now. The reversal in overall borrowing during 2013 was driven by increased credit card and mortgage debt among the young and those with high credit scores. While this suggests that lenders are concerned about the safe underwriting of such loans, it also points to the overall importance of borrowing by younger individuals. Not only did borrowers under age forty-nine take on more credit card and mortgage debt in 2013, they also did most of the borrowing to finance auto purchases and college educations. This is not new\u2014historically, younger individuals account for most new loan originations, while older individuals on average pay down their outstanding debt. Nonetheless, while borrowing for such things as cars and houses is up among younger individuals, it remains somewhat subdued.\n\nNow, this overall picture\u2014young borrowers getting loans while older borrowers are reducing their debts\u2014makes sense, and it is consistent with a growing population and improving income prospects for the young. The fact that (unlike 2006) we now see reductions in mortgage debt for the least creditworthy borrowers tells us about how unusual lending was during the credit boom of the mid-2000s, and it is instructive and reassuring to see that today\u2019s patterns look different.\n\nIn spite of the improved outlook for income growth and consumption implied by these changes in the way households view and use debt, some imponderables remain on the horizon. For one, the dramatic increase in student debt implies that a fundamental change has taken place in the way we finance higher education in the U.S. A combination of rising college costs, reduced subsidies from cash-strapped state governments to their state universities, and cutbacks in home equity loans and other sources of financing has left new college attendees with larger debts.\n\nThere\u2019s been a tremendous amount of attention to the growth of student loans in recent years, and our data indicate some of the reasons why. First, student loans are the only form of debt that grew consistently even through the depths of the crisis and the long period of debt paydown. Second, the growth in educational debt, like that of auto loans, is concentrated among the lower and middle credit-score groups.\n\nUnlike other types of loans, student debt continued to grow steadily during and after the recession; now, at almost $1.1 trillion, it comprises 9 percent of household debt and represents the second largest source of debt for U.S. households after mortgages. Student loans provide critical access to schooling, given the challenge presented by the increasing costs of higher education. Those with college degrees earn a high return on their educations; they are much less likely to be unemployed, and they earn on average twice as much as those with only high school diplomas.\n\nOur research indicates that the large growth in student debt, and an associated high level of student debt delinquencies, has been associated with a reduction in mortgage and auto loan borrowing among younger people. While younger individuals were previously much more likely to finance home and car purchases by age thirty,Chart 16 (Proportion of Borrowers with Home-secured Debt at Age 30) shows that those with student debt are now less likely to do so than those with no student debt, as shown by Brown and Caldwell in a Liberty Street Economics blog post in 2013.5 In fact, our research suggests that student debt appears to have replaced or crowded out other types of debt, so that the difference in average total debt held by student-loan and non-student-loan borrowers has remained stable over time.\n\nWe suspect that this decline in taking on other types of debt by student-loan borrowers partly reflects increased uncertainty about the future. However, in addition to a possibly reduced appetite for borrowing, a reduction in access to credit is also likely to play an important role, despite the comparatively high earning potential of those with a college education.\n\nConsumers with substantial student debt may not be able to meet the stricter debt-to-income (DTI) ratio standards that are now being applied by lenders, particularly on mortgage loans. We believe that student debt growth among new graduates has been higher in the most recent years than growth in their incomes. In addition, delinquency in repayment has become more prevalent among student borrowers, and those with past delinquencies are likely to find it much more difficult to borrow. This decline in credit accessibility is also captured by credit scores. During most of the first decade of the 2000s, those with and without student loans had comparable average credit scores at ages twenty-five and thirty, but since 2010, student loan borrowers have had significantly lower average credit scores. As a result of tighter underwriting standards, higher delinquency rates, and lower credit scores, consumers with educational debt may on average have more limited access to housing and auto loans and, as a result, more limited options in the housing and vehicle markets. This disadvantage may compound the difficulties of young people who enter a depressed labor market; in addition to facing a spell of unemployment that may lead to reduced earnings for a considerable period of time, they may also face tighter future credit constraints as a result of delinquencies on their student loans.\n\nIn this light, the recent increase in borrowing among younger individuals is consistent with an improvement in labor market prospects and some loosening of credit standards, although the increase in borrowing by younger age cohorts is modest and remains below their pre-crisis level. The high level of student debt may create the risk of a drag on future consumption growth. In fact, while highly skilled young workers have traditionally provided a vital influx of new, affluent consumers to U.S. housing and auto markets, the unprecedented growth in student debt and the persistently high student loan delinquency rates are likely to dampen the influence of this group in today\u2019s marketplace and may represent a structural or long-lasting change in household credit markets.\n\nTo summarize, I have reviewed the many positive signals we should take from the fact that in 2013 we observed the first year-over-year increase in borrowing by U.S. households since 2008.  The willingness of U.S. households to increase their debt levels in aggregate likely reflects the restorative influences of significant turnarounds in house prices and stock market values since their lows in 2009-10, somewhat better employment outcomes, and much stronger household balance sheets as a result of write-offs and pay-downs of earlier indebtedness.  In addition, a gradual loosening of credit availability is likely to have accommodated the increased demand for credit, although mortgage lending continues to be subject to high credit standards. Together, these developments bode well for the macroeconomy, suggesting that U.S. households can return to more normal patterns of borrowing to smooth consumption and to invest in autos and houses. \n\nStill, despite the return to more normal patterns of borrowing, it is worth pondering the significance of the recent change in the composition of household debt as student loans have grown to be the second-largest category of household debt after mortgages. While these loans provide critical access to schooling, they may constrain the consumption choices of young people, especially those who graduate in periods of poor employment prospects. \n\n1 See Gauti B.

    "content": "It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak here today.  This is my first time in New Zealand (not counting a brief stop at the Auckland airport).  I\u2019m delighted to be here and am heading down to the South Island tomorrow.  \n\nToday, I am going to talk about the challenges that face us in ensuring stability in the global financial system.  While we have made considerable progress in strengthening the financial system\u2014for example, large global banks have considerably more capital and liquidity resources than prior to the financial crisis\u2014there is still a significant amount of hard work ahead for all of us.  For example, we need to develop resolution mechanisms that will work on a global basis and we need to ensure that the clearing of standardized over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives through central counterparties (CCPs) is done safely.  We also need to improve our ability to aggregate and share data.  We need to do this in order to develop a coherent view of the global financial system so that we can deal with emerging vulnerabilities in a timely and effective way.  As always, my remarks today reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System.  \n\nIn the years prior to Lehman Brothers\u2019 failure, critical vulnerabilities built up within the global financial system.  Banks evolved from being local in their geographic footprint, to national and then international in scope.  Supervision and regulation did not keep pace with these changes and capital and liquidity requirements were underdeveloped during this period.  Our view into the operations of global banks was too limited due both to shortcomings of banks in aggregating their internal information and to difficulties in sharing information globally across supervisors. \n\nAt the same time, the so-called \u201cshadow banking\u201d system was growing in both size and complexity.  Particularly noteworthy was the proliferation of money-like instruments created outside of the traditional banking sector that were used to finance long-term, illiquid assets.  In the U.S., protections against bank runs that were put into place during the Great Depression did not extend to this new shadow banking sector.  \n\nPut simply, we did not have a good picture of the global financial system.  As a result, we were unable to observe its growing instabilities or respond preemptively to emerging vulnerabilities.  \n\nWhile the official sector has made considerable progress in addressing these weaknesses, important challenges remain.  In particular, we must eliminate the regime of having \u201ctoo-big-to-fail\u201d financial institutions.  I believe that a multi-faceted approach is needed involving four major components.  First, we need to minimize the risk that a large, complex financial firm fails in the first place.  Second, we need to have credible resolution regimes in place should such a failure materialize despite our best efforts.  Third, we need to strengthen the resiliency of our financial system so that the stresses associated with the failure of a major financial firm are not amplified across the system. Fourth, we need to build up our data capabilities so we can better monitor the global financial system as a whole.  For the full benefit from this multifaceted approach to be realized, public authorities must continue to work together in a coordinated manner. \n\nGlobal, systemically important financial institutions (G-SIFIs) pose a significant challenge to financial stability on two fronts.  First, due to their size, complexity and central role in financial markets, a disorderly failure of a G-SIFI would directly cause major disruptions in markets, adversely affecting credit flows and real economic activity.  Second, such a disorderly failure would also indirectly place significant negative strains on other financial firms due not only to direct credit exposures to the failed institution, but also due to the fire sale dynamics that would ensue.  The lack of transparency in markets as to which firms would be most affected could result in a general pull-back by investors, which, in turn, could lead to additional deleveraging and further downward pressure on asset prices.  As we saw during the financial crisis, this amplification mechanism could quickly spread the strains throughout the global financial system.           \n\nPrior to the financial crisis, the risk to financial stability posed by G-SIFIs created a dilemma for policymakers when one or more of these firms found itself in danger of failing.  On the one hand, standing back and not intervening would enhance market discipline.  This market discipline would provide incentives for better decision-making by the management of financial firms and more vigorous monitoring by their creditors.  On the other hand, the risks to financial stability from a failure would have been extraordinarily high, creating pressure for the official sector to intervene in an effort to prevent a disorderly failure.           \n\nHistorically, in most cases when the relevant firms were very large and complex, this dilemma has led to official sector interventions.  A consequence is that market discipline was undermined for those firms perceived to be \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d  To the extent that such actions cause creditors to anticipate future interventions that would shield them from losses, this reduces creditors\u2019 incentive to monitor the management of these firms or respond forcefully in the case of early signs of deterioration.  In addition, because the expectation of official sector intervention lowers expected credit losses, this results in cheaper funding costs and provides G-SIFIs with a competitive advantage.  It also creates an incentive for such firms to take actions to maintain their too-big-to fail status to preserve this funding advantage.  As a consequence, the structure of the financial system has evolved towards larger and more complex firms than can be justified by economies of scale and scope.           \n\nThis is an unacceptable regime and this policy dilemma needs to be resolved.  Ideally, we want a regime in which we retain the benefits from the services provided by G-SIFIs to the economy, but not at the price of having to \u201cbail-out\u201d such institutions in order to preserve financial stability should they come to the brink of failure.  \n\nI believe that a credible solution involves two complementary goals.  First, coordinated steps must be taken to significantly reduce the likelihood that a G-SIFI ever reaches the point where it is at risk of failure.  This risk should be pushed well below the level for smaller and less complex financial institutions.  Second, home jurisdictions for these G-SIFIs need credible resolution mechanisms that can be implemented on a global basis so these firms can fail without large systemic consequences.  A resolution mechanism will be credible only if it reduces the negative externalities from such a failure to an acceptable level.           \n\nWhile progress has been made toward these two goals, additional work and coordination is still required.  Turning first to efforts to reduce the likelihood that a G-SIFI will be at risk of failing, the Basel international standards raised both the quantity and quality of capital for internationally active banks.  Banks also are required to capture more complex risks in their measures of risk-weighted assets.  To complement the stronger risk-weighted capital standards, an international leverage ratio requirement also has been adopted. \n\nIn addition, the Basel framework will require a capital buffer that increases with a firm\u2019s size, complexity, interconnectedness and global footprint.  In addition to providing additional loss absorbing capacity, this capital buffer requirement will act to offset any funding advantages for G-SIFIs, helping to level the playing field with smaller, less complex financial institutions.  Together, when fully implemented, these changes should reduce the failure risk for G-SIFIs. \n\nTo complement the Basel framework, I believe that jurisdictions need to create processes and incentives for management of G-SIFIs to act earlier and more decisively in response to emerging risks facing their firms.  Proactive interventions by the senior management of banks will have a greater efficacy and a lower cost than reactive steps taken only in response to growing market pressure.  These proactive management interventions can take many forms including raising additional capital, cutting capital distributions, restructuring business lines and making difficult personnel changes.  Avoiding a hazard is easier if one\u2019s focal point is kept well down the road. \n\nOfficial sector stress tests are an important tool that can facilitate this forward-looking management focus.  One example is the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process in the United States.  The goal of CCAR is to ensure that banks have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes, as well as sufficient capital to withstand severely stressed economic conditions while, maintaining their ability to perform their critical roles of credit intermediation.  In CCAR, each of the participating banks is required to project the impact of particular forward-looking stress scenarios on their operations over a two-year horizon.  Both the banks and the supervisors conduct independent assessments of the impact of the stress scenarios on the various business lines of the bank.  This approach provides a cross-validation of each bank\u2019s analysis, while at the same time generating results that can be compared across the participating banks. \n\nAnother important feature of CCAR is that the scenarios and the key aspects of the banks results are made public rather than treated as confidential supervisory information.  This transparency is important for supporting market confidence in the banking system.  Finally, a critical aspect of the stress testing process is the supervisory review of the capital planning process for each participating bank.  This planning process is what reinforces and promotes a proactive stance by management to emerging risks. \n\nThe structure of bank management compensation also could be designed to provide incentives that reinforce a proactive, forward-looking risk management approach.  As I will discuss in a moment, sufficient long-term debt that can be converted to equity is an important element of an effective resolution mechanism for G-SIFIs.  While the magnitude of this long-term debt needs to be sufficient to ensure that public funds are not at risk in the event that a resolution of a firm is necessary, making this long-term debt a component of management compensation might also be used to help reduce the likelihood of a default.  Long-term debt provided by outside creditors exposed to risk of default can create useful market discipline.  However, outside creditors do not have the same information or decision rights as inside management.  Structuring a long-term debt requirement so that a meaningful component consists of deferred compensation held by senior management would presumably strengthen the incentives for proactive risk management.  In my opinion, more research is needed into how the structure of management compensation for financial firms could incentivize good risk management and limit the appetite for excessive risk.1\n\nEven if every jurisdiction were to successfully implement these types of initiatives and consequently reduce the default risks associated with their G-SIFIs, the risk of failure would not be fully eliminated.  This means there would always be some residual risk of major disruptions to financial markets due to a disorderly default of a large financial firm.  Consequently, the development and implementation of credible resolution mechanisms for G-SIFIs is the second key component of a global strategy to improve financial stability.  By credible, I mean that if the situation of an impending G-SIFI default arises, the home authorities will proceed with the resolution plan, rather than give in to pressure to intervene to prevent the failure.  This requires that the resolution mechanisms be capable of significantly mitigating the negative externalities associated with winding down a failing G-SIFI.  Although the specifics of the resolution mechanisms will necessarily vary to some extent across jurisdictions, reflecting differences in institutional structures, legal frameworks, and regulatory regimes, the goal is common\u2014to be able to resolve any G-SIFI regardless of its home jurisdiction, even in periods of stressful financial market conditions, without taxpayer funds, in a way that minimizes knock-on effect to financial markets and other financial institutions. \n\nAs I have indicated in earlier speeches, I endorse the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\u2019s (FDIC) single point of entry (SPE) resolution framework for the United States.  For the SPE approach to be successful, firms subject to this resolution regime will need to have a sufficient amount of long-term debt at the parent company that the FDIC can convert into equity to guarantee that the new bridge company is adequately capitalized.  Counterparties at the subsidiary level need to be assured that they have no reason to pull back from the new bridge company. \n\nIn the international arena this type of requirement is referred to as GLAC, or \u201cgone concern loss absorption capacity.\u201d  The Financial Stability Board is working on a proposal for an international GLAC standard, with a target date for consideration this November. Finalizing this standard is an important to-do item.  As I discussed earlier, both the amount and the composition of additional resources are important.  The adequacy of the GLAC buffer mitigates the negative externalities from a default, while the possible use of management-held long-term debt as an element of GLAC could bolster incentives to reduce the risk of a default in the first place. \n\nThere are implementation details of the FDIC\u2019s SPE resolution framework that still need to be worked out.  These arise from the challenge involved in operationalizing the framework with financial firms that conduct business across several jurisdictions and geographic borders.  In this international arena, one specific issue needs to be promptly addressed.  Due to parent guarantees or other cross-default provisions, the placement by the FDIC of the parent company into receivership may be treated by some counterparties as an event of default.  This could trigger the close-out of qualified financial contracts (QFCs) such as interest rate swap contracts at international subsidiaries, which could potentially be destabilizing.  To deal with this issue, the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s Title II one-day stay on the close-out of qualified financial contracts needs to be extended to cover contracts governed by non-U.S. law and involving non-U.S. counterparties.  Resolving this issue is important to ensuring a smooth transition to the new bridge company. \n\nAddressing the contract close-out issue can be accomplished in two ways that are not mutually exclusive.  First, existing derivative contracts could be amended and future contracts written to stipulate that the parent\u2019s placement into a Title II resolution does not trigger the close-out option.  Second, legal provisions in other countries could be modified so that the one-day stay that applies to qualified financial contracts governed by U.S. law is also enforceable for those contracts governed by foreign law.  Either or both of these actions would help ensure that the FDIC\u2019s SPE mechanism could be successfully executed without unduly disrupting financial markets and counterparty risk positions. \n\nGiven the cross-border activities of the G-SIFIs, the effectiveness of resolution mechanisms also will depend on the degree of coordination across national authorities.  For example, we do not know for certain how foreign authorities would react if the parent of a U.S.-based G-SIFI were placed into a Title II resolution proceeding.  Uncertainties exist regarding whether foreign authorities either might choose, or be required, to take defensive actions such as ring-fencing that could disrupt the smooth implementation of the resolution process.  An important task going forward is for authorities to work cooperatively and expeditiously to resolve these uncertainties. \n\nA well-crafted and well-executed resolution process for G-SIFIs can still be expected to create some strains in financial markets, especially considering the likely unsettled state of these markets at the time a resolution is being implemented.  This suggests that it is also important to work on improving the resiliency in financial markets so that any shocks associated with a G-SIFI resolution are dampened rather than amplified.  Two areas of work that show promise along these lines are new funding requirements and the move to central clearing for many OTC derivatives. \n\nAn important function of financial firms is to provide liquidity to the market.  However, this exposes financial firms to run risk.  Liquidity runs can be an accelerant to asset fire sales that can lead to downward price spirals where firms must sell assets to raise funds, with these sales putting more downward pressure on asset prices, leading to a renewed round of asset sales.  For solvent financial firms, protection against liquidity runs requires liquidity buffers and/or access to appropriately collateralized central bank liquidity support.  Financial firms on their own would likely choose to hold liquidity buffers that are smaller than socially optimal since these firms do not internalize the positive market externality that these liquidity buffers provide.  As a consequence, liquidity regulation is necessary to achieve the desired level of firms\u2019 liquidity buffers. \n\nLiquidity buffer requirements are also needed to reduce the dependence of these firms on central bank lender-of-last-resort (LOLR) support.  There are several reasons this is desirable.  First, access to central bank liquidity can lead to moral hazard with respect to the behavior of financial firms.  This can be mitigated by requiring that firms with access to LOLR support hold sufficient liquidity buffers that must be used ahead of any central bank liquidity\u2014the equivalent of liquidity \u201cskin-in-the game.\u201d Second, the line between illiquidity and insolvency often can become blurred, especially when markets are under stress.  Central banks are meant to provide liquidity support only to solvent firms so that the central banks avoid taking on credit risk.  An overreliance by firms on access to central bank liquidity can expose the central bank to the risk of loss.  Finally, in some cases, central bank liquidity provision can become stigmatized.  In this case, financial firms are prone to underutilize this source of liquidity\u2014a decision that can have adverse consequences for markets and the availability of credit.  Liquidity buffers reduce the likelihood that this stigma constraint will become binding. \n\nThe on-going Basel discussions have focused on a short-term liquidity requirement\u2014the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR); and a longer-term liquidity requirement, the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR).  The intention of the LCR is for banks to hold sufficient high-quality, liquid assets that can be easily and quickly converted to cash to cover expected liquidity outflows in a stress scenario over a 30-day period.  Unlike illiquid assets, the conversion of these high quality liquid assets into cash should not create any fire sale dynamics.  However, it is important that banks actually use this liquidity buffer when there are liquidity outflows, rather than attempting to maintain their LCR at 100 percent by selling other assets. \n\nThe OTC derivatives markets remain another important source of potential instability.  Recognizing this vulnerability, the Group of Twenty (G20) in its 2009 Pittsburgh Summit statement stipulated that all standardized derivative contracts would be moved to central clearing, and that the remaining non-standard derivatives would be subject to higher capital requirements.2  While there will inevitably be a residual share of derivatives that do not lend themselves to standardization, authorities need to continue to work collaboratively to keep this residual share to a minimum. \n\nWhy is standardization so important?  Standardization has advantages in terms of increasing transparency, price discovery and liquidity.  Standardization is also important because it allows the derivatives to be centrally cleared in a CCP.  Without central clearing, participants have bilateral credit exposures to each of their counterparties.  Moreover, they cannot fully assess their credit risk exposures in this framework since there is no information on the other derivative contracts that their counterparties have with other market participants.  Central clearing replaces this complex web with a single set of relationships between the firm and the CCP as its counterparty.  This allows for netting, so that a firm\u2019s risk is limited to its net exposure to the central counterparty.  This both reduces risk and increases transparency.  Consequently, members of the CCP have less of an incentive to pull back in periods of stress and this makes the market more resilient. \n\nIn addition, international standards on margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives have been adopted.3  By definition, bespoke derivatives cannot be centrally cleared and so do not benefit from the risk reduction and enhanced transparency associated with central clearing.  To offset this, these derivatives will be required by regulation to have higher initial margin requirements, as well as variation margin. \n\nDespite these efforts, we still may not get the balance right in terms of the requirements applied to non-standard versus standardized, cleared contracts.  One worry is that CCPs that are shareholder-owned and operated for profit may compete for market share by offering lower margin requirements on standardized products.  This could strike the wrong balance between the private profit motive versus the public benefit of clearing.  For this reason, I believe that all CCPs need to have strong governance and regulatory oversight.  This must be harmonized on an international basis in order to prevent a potential race to the bottom. \n\nIt is important to recognize that increased use of CCPs for central clearing also creates potential financial stability issues that must be addressed.  While CCPs reduce aggregate risk, they also concentrate the remaining risk.  That is, CCPs create potential single points of failure in global derivatives markets.  CCPs need adequate capacity to absorb potential losses from the default of one or more of its members, and they need to have access to liquidity so that they can always fully settle their obligations.  \n\nTo address this concern, in 2012, international standard setters issued a set of minimum risk management standards for financial market infrastructures including CCPs.4  These principles, known as the \u201cPrinciples for Financial Market Infrastructures\u201d (PFMIs), require that a CCP maintain sufficient liquid resources.  This includes the requirement that a CCP have a pre-funded default arrangement and that the CCP collects initial and variation margin.  In particular, the PFMIs stipulate that a CCP must be able to withstand, in a stress environment, the failure of the member having the largest exposure to the CCP.  In some cases, this requirement is strengthened to require the ability to cover the failure of the two largest members.  The PFMIs also require the CCPs to develop effective methodologies to estimate their funding exposures, so that they can better manage their liquidity risks.\n\nAnother important risk management task for CCPs is the on-boarding of new members and the monitoring of the condition of existing members.  The strength of the CCP is ultimately derived from the collective strength of its members.  The mutualization of the CCP\u2019s net credit risk across its members creates an incentive for its members to only want well-capitalized and well-managed members as part of the CCP.  The CCP also must ensure that members are meeting their margin requirements and remain in good standing.  \n\nIt is also worth noting that these safeguards for CCPs will need to be put into place along with other reforms such as the use of multilateral trading platforms and trade repositories.  Seamless integration with these new trading processes is essential for CCPs to contribute to financial stability. \n\nThe financial crisis also highlighted the significant gaps that existed between the data collected and the data necessary to adequately monitor developments in the global financial system.  In addition, the crisis underscored an important limitation of the current data structure: the inability to combine data effectively across jurisdictions in order to develop a comprehensive view. As a consequence, policymakers often did not have timely access to key information that would have informed both the diagnosis of emerging problems as well as the likely efficacy of proposed interventions.  As we all know, it is difficult to safely steer a fast-moving car if outward vision is impaired by a windshield that is largely obscured.           \n\nIn response, the G20 in April 2009 instructed the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to detail these information gaps and to develop proposals for resolving them.  The Data Gaps Initiative (DGI) was the response to carry out this important work.  The DGI set out four broad objectives: (1) Better capture the build-up of risk in the financial sector, (2) improve data on international financial network connections, (3) monitor the vulnerability of domestic economies to shocks, and (4) improve the communication of official statistics.  Across these four objectives twenty specific recommendations were developed.5  In particular, the DGI effort included developing a centralized data center to pool relevant data for all globally systemically important banks (GSIBs).6 \n\nImplementing the DGI agenda involves more than simply defining common data templates and retooling bank information systems to populate these templates.  Rather, what is required is a deeper cultural change in how supervisors operate and interact with each other.  This transformation takes time and involves a process of building mutual trust.  To date, a new data center has been established at the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) that is receiving data on G-SIB institution-to-institution counterparty credit exposures.  Work is underway to expand this data collection to include institution-to-institution funding dependencies, with additional work to follow on institution-to-aggregate credit and funding.  Home supervisors contributing data to the BIS data center are receiving reports based on an analysis of the pooled data.  Supporting this collaborative initiative is a multilateral framework signed by all of the participating supervisors that details confidentiality requirements, data sharing, and governance arrangements.  As this effort moves forward, the data will be available to support both enhanced micro-prudential supervision and macro-prudential supervision. \n\nMore work, though, needs to be done to facilitate a comprehensive data view of the important financial markets.  As an example, an increasing number of trade repositories are collecting valuable transaction data.  However, the full benefit of these data can only be realized if we can aggregate this information across the trade repositories, and if regulators have access to the data needed to support their respective mandates.7  The Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) have produced an analysis of some of the foundational steps that need to be taken.8  Again, implementing these steps will take time and will need our continued attention. \n\nThe goal of financial stability will remain elusive so long as we have financial firms that are judged as \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d  Some might argue that this is reason enough to break up these firms.  I do not believe that this is the best course of action.  As I have outlined here today, I prefer a multi-faceted approach that strives to: (1) minimize the risk that a large complex financial firm faces default, (2) have in place a credible resolution regime if a default becomes imminent, (3) improve the resiliency of our financial system so that any shocks resulting from a resolution are not amplified across the system, and (4) build out a global data model for effectively monitoring global financial markets.  If we can execute on these four elements, then I believe that we can retain the economic benefits from having large financial firms that support the global economy while minimizing the risks that the activities of such firms might pose to the global financial system. \n\nThank you for your kind attention. \n\n1 Structuring this in a way to get the incentives right is critical.

    "content": "Introduction\n\nWelcome to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. We are fortunate to have many central bankers and international nongovernment organizations represented here today.  Because we are part of the Federal Reserve System, the central bank of the United States, we share many of the same data obstacles you are currently facing.  As the head of Research and Statistics at the New York Fed, I\u2019d like to share with you the challenges and rewards associated with data in our organization, particularly the data that we use to analyze policy questions.\n\nThe New York Fed is uniquely positioned for several reasons.  In addition to being the largest of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks, it has the distinction of including a Markets Group that conducts Open Market Operations for the Federal Reserve System.  Additionally, the New York Fed supervises financial institutions, including foreign banks doing business in our district.  These special responsibilities contribute to our tremendous reliance on data.\n\nData is crucial to our core objectives and all aspects of our work. \n\nData is the foundation for developing international standards in bank capital and liquidity requirements.  Data is an integral part of researching economic issues and the labor and financial markets.  Data is also central to our jobs of forecasting and identifying trends.  Our understanding of interest rates, reserves, and balance sheets is built on data.  In our efforts to promote financial stability, data is fundamental to stress testing.  In our financial services efforts, payment information and data flows figure critically in our payment systems.  The scope of our data consumption and creation spans a wide range.  It encompasses local, regional, national, and global coverage and extends from the micro to the most broadly aggregated levels.\n\nConsequently, as an organization we are increasingly dealing with a growing number of data challenges.  They include the multitude of legal topics associated with contractual terms and conditions of data use, data sharing, and privacy restrictions.  We are constantly challenged to develop and maintain clear and comprehensive data dictionaries that enable us to repurpose data appropriately.  Moreover, as we continue to create more data, we are focusing on data governance.  This entails oversight and measures to ensure that our own data are accurately posted (with updated revisions and associated documentation) by commercial aggregators.  All of this growth requires investments in both technology and personnel to support our ever-expanding data requirements.\n\nChallenges in the Use of Data\n\nI\u2019ll focus my remarks on two important challenges that we face in using data effectively, as well as some models we may draw from to overcome those challenges.\n\nThe first challenge is what we might think of as data innovation, and the second is data stewardship.\n\nWith data innovation, the big challenge is to use our imagination and to think hard about what data may be able to say about a particular problem.  This includes both novel uses of existing data as well as the collection of new data.  To illustrate what I mean by this, let me describe one effort, among many, here at the New York Fed.\n\nConsumer Credit Panel\n\nI\u2019ll describe our Consumer Credit Panel, which we created in 2010.  At the onset of the financial crisis, it became apparent that our knowledge of the liability side of household balance sheets was inadequate.  At that time, the main data sources on consumer debt consisted of loan-level data sets on specific categories of loans, such as mortgages, as well as aggregated data on household sector debt from the Board of Governors\u2019 Flow of Funds statistical release.  While providing a useful aggregate overview of household debt, the Flow of Funds release defines the household sector as a residual sector that also includes nonprofit organizations, such as schools, hospitals and churches, as well as hedge funds and private equity funds.  Furthermore, the overview it provides is limited to outstanding balances and lacks important information on the origination, repayment, and delinquency status of household debt.  And both loan-level data and aggregates like the Flow of Funds miss an important dimension of borrower behavior that became very important during the crisis and recovery\u2014the relationship between different kinds of credit use by individual borrowers or households.\n\nThe creation of the Consumer Credit Panel is an example of the use of pre-existing commercial data in an innovative way that had not previously been pursued.  The panel is based on credit report data collected by Equifax (one of the three credit bureaus in the United States) and it contains information on all outstanding loans\u2014including mortgages, auto and student loans, and credit card debt\u2014at the individual consumer level.  While credit records are primarily used by lenders to evaluate a potential borrower\u2019s creditworthiness and ability to repay, they can also provide a comprehensive picture of outstanding balances and delinquencies and how they interact.  Of course, all the data are completely anonymous\u2014the dataset has been stripped of all personally identifiable information.\n\nThe CCP was created by our research group using an innovative sampling procedure, based on the randomness of the last four digits of social security numbers.  The resulting panel allows one to track individuals over time and across different locations within the nation, starting in the quarter in which they establish their credit report when taking out their first loan.  The sampling approach generates the same entry and exit behavior as present in the population, with young individuals and immigrants entering the sample and deceased individuals and emigrants leaving the sample each quarter at the same rate as in the U.S. population.  As a result, for each quarter starting in 1999, the panel constitutes a representative cross-section of the population of borrowers.\n\nMoreover, once the random sample of individuals is identified, we then include the credit records of all individuals living at the same address, so the panel can be used to analyze new loan originations, balances, and delinquencies at the household level.  Consumer debt traditionally has been measured at the individual level, but most economic decision making is done at the household level.  In fact, consumer income and assets are commonly measured and analyzed at the household level.  For studying household economic behavior, and in particular for understanding life-cycle household finance, it would similarly be more useful to examine debt and credit aggregated at the household level.  It may also be important to consider the distribution of debt within households.\n\nBeyond the ability to link individual consumer and household-level loans over time, the panel improves on typical loan-level datasets by linking multiple loans to the same consumer.  Thus, at each point in time, one can see whether the individual holds multiple first mortgages or a combination of first and second mortgages while at the same time holding various types of non-mortgage debt. \n\nAs you can imagine, the panel has been a great resource, accessible by staff at all Federal Reserve banks through a fast and easy-to-use interface.  It has already been used in several Federal Reserve Board and Treasury reports, Federal Open Market Committee presentations, speeches, and congressional testimonies, and in about 100 research papers and policy analyses.  It also has value for our community outreach, as we can profile specific geographical regions.\n\nParticularly impactful have been our releases of the Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit, containing a comprehensive summary of households\u2019 access to and use of credit.  Several of our research findings have influenced policy debates.  For example, an important question regarding recent household deleveraging has been to what extent the decline in aggregate household debt was attributable to delinquent debt charge-offs as opposed to active debt paydowns by consumers.  Our research found that while charge-offs played an important role, a huge change in consumer behavior had taken place.  While consumers extracted home equity and took on more debt during 2007, they reverted to actively paying down debt during 2009, creating a remarkable $480 billion reversal in cash flow available for consumption in just two years.  In our most recent report we are seeing signs suggesting that the deleveraging period has reached its end.  The availability of borrower-level data has been key to our ability to analyze consumer behavior.\n\nSomewhat unexpectedly, it has also turned out that the CCP provides a comprehensive national picture of total outstanding student loan balances and delinquency rates that heretofore did not exist.  It was in a Quarterly Report, for example, that we first reported that student loan debt exceeded credit card debt, in early 2010.  Our findings helped bring the surge in student debt and delinquencies to the attention of the public.  Our research also highlighted its potential implications for consumption growth, showing a strong association between the increase in student loan debt and the decline in mortgage and auto loan origination rates over the past few years.\n\nComing back to the broader issue of data innovation, it is interesting to note that dataset merges have been behind a growing number of important academic studies and research findings in recent years.  While showing how the value of datasets can be greatly enhanced by linking them, these studies underscore the need for creative thinking to maintain anonymity and representativeness of the matched sample.  We are currently pursuing various ways to enhance the value of the Consumer Credit Panel further by linking to property deed records, employer payroll records, small business credit data, and student college records.\n\nThe CCP shows how existing data\u2014in this case credit reports\u2014can be re-purposed to serve new public policy and research uses.  But sometimes existing data sources just can\u2019t provide the answers we need, and in those cases data innovation requires creating something completely new.\n\nSurvey of Consumer Expectations\n\nSo a second important example of data innovation at the New York Fed is the Survey of Consumer Expectations, which we introduced to the public just last month.  Consumer expectations of future economic outcomes are crucial inputs to the policy process, but we felt that our standard measures of these expectations were quite limited.  The primary goal of this new national survey is to collect timely, rich, and high-quality information on consumer expectations about a wide range of household-level and aggregate economic and financial conditions.  The survey covers expectations about inflation, price changes for specific goods, home price changes, future wage growth, future quits and layoffs, and residential mobility, as well as expectations of household income, spending, taxes, and credit access. \n\nThe SCE has two advantages over existing surveys of expectations: It collects information about consumers\u2019 expectations and decisions on a broader range of economic and financial topics, and it does so in a way that captures respondents\u2019 beliefs more fully.  The objective is to measure an individual\u2019s beliefs about the likelihood of future outcomes, thereby capturing how certain or uncertain the person is about future events.  In some cases, we do this by eliciting a \u201cdensity forecast,\u201d where respondents are asked to assign a percent chance to different values (or intervals) for the outcome of interest.  In addition to providing a measure of individual forecast uncertainty, these density forecasts yield richer information about how expectations vary across people and over time than do single-value forecasts, or \u201cpoint predictions.\u201d\n\nThe SCE is the outcome of a five-year collaborative research project involving economists, psychologists, and survey design experts.  During this period, we conducted a large number of experimental surveys to assess the information elicited with existing survey questions and to develop new questions, including those for measuring forecast uncertainty.  This preliminary work and the probabilistic format of the new survey questions represent an important innovation that builds on academic work over the past 20 years by economist Charles Manski, as well as some early pioneering survey work conducted by the Bank of Italy. \n\nCreating the CCP and SCE has yielded some important lessons.  First, data innovation requires an ability to think outside the box, and it benefits from the collaboration of people with diverse skills and backgrounds\u2014academic economists, but also representatives of other academic disciplines and individuals with business and public policy experience.  Skills in identifying valuable but underutilized data, the creation of data linkages, the development of appropriate sampling procedures, and survey methodology and questionnaire design experience are all particularly valuable.  In this respect, our experiences mirror those at the many new interdisciplinary data and social research centers and numerous \u201cBig Data\u201d university centers being created across the country.  A key impetus behind these centers is to bring together a group of individuals with different skills, interests, and experiences in an environment that encourages independent and innovative thinking.  These individuals bring their unique questions and knowledge to the task of finding new ways of using the enormous amount of electronic data that exists today, as we did with the CCP.  In addition, they can collaborate to identify efficient ways of creating new data, as we did with the SCE.  \n\nA second lesson is that it is important to offer clear incentives for data innovation.  Giving researchers the flexibility and the resources to use new unique data in their research and policy analyses is a strong motivating factor.  In fact, we have found the availability of unique data to be an important recruitment and retention tool for talent in research.\n\nA final lesson is that data innovation can be costly, both in terms of required staff hours and effort and in direct cost, especially when it involves data purchased from vendors or data collected through surveys.  The gains should therefore be carefully weighed against the overall costs.\n\nData Stewardship\n\nData innovation as I\u2019ve described it here comes with some costs.  In an environment with rapidly growing numbers of large and complex datasets, efficient data utilization requires an ability to easily find, trust, use, and share the data.  Without those prerequisites, there is a significant risk that innovative and valuable datasets would be underutilized because their availability is not widely known, their reliability is inadequately evaluated and documented, and their use proves too costly, requiring large time investments by each user.  In my view, effective data utilization therefore cannot be achieved without adequate recognition, funding, and support of a data steward role.  \n\nSubject matter experts serving as data stewards have a number of important data management responsibilities.  A primary one is the production of detailed documentation of the data sources and content.  Such documentation is vital for preserving institutional memory, which can be lost when key personnel leave, and it needs to be updated regularly.  This documentation also includes the creation of higher-level metadata that can help potential users determine the applicability of the dataset to their specific needs.  Data stewards play an important role not only in documenting the provenance of the data but also in evaluating the quality of the data, to determine whether it can be trusted for different purposes. \n\nThe availability of rich documentation on data lineage and usage, combined with high-quality user support, will reduce learning costs for users, lighten the question-and-answer workload for data providers, and promote the efficient allocation of resources.  Adequate documentation of data quality and the tracking of known data issues will help ensure that the data are properly used and will reduce the likelihood of user misunderstanding of the data, a risk that can lead to inappropriate data usage and erroneous results.\n\nOur limited experience to date with data stewards who have been explicitly hired or assigned to this role has been very positive.  This investment has helped accelerate data usage, ensure analytical quality, and maintain vendor contract compliance.  Importantly, it has significantly reduced the burden on senior staff in responding to data questions and requests for data or analyses.\n\nSuccessful implementation of this model requires not only a formal recognition of the data steward role, but an appropriate level of resources to support data stewardship, including some training in the foundational disciplines of data management.  Incentives may be required to induce subject matter experts to take a formal data steward role.  To provide these incentives requires thinking through career concerns of people, and may require a whole new career track for data stewardship, one that provides sufficient autonomy to provide the steward time and incentives to conduct data analysis and research.  These investments are very worthwhile, because they unlock the potential in innovative datasets and make progress possible in answering crucial policy questions.\n\nLearning from Others\n\nBefore I close, I\u2019d like to note that data innovation is challenging, but there is an effective and widely available way to achieve it, and that is to learn from others. \n\nOver the past few years we at the New York Fed have hosted and visited colleagues at the Bank of England, Bank of Korea, Bank of Japan, and the Bank of Mexico to exchange ideas and discuss some of our data projects.  Much can be learned from sharing experiences in creating and managing new data products.  The information uncovered in some countries\u2019 well-designed data collections can help other countries to direct their own data-gathering efforts.  For example, other countries are very interested in what can be learned about the household sector from credit bureau data like the CCP.  We have taken suggestions for particular questions from other countries\u2019 surveys.\n\nWe can also benefit tremendously from learning through direct collaboration.  In a new research project with the Dutch Central Bank, we are investigating how the interview mode affects the survey response rate and response accuracy when asking people about financial issues.  More specifically, we are evaluating whether soliciting personal financial information through the Internet elicits more accurate and complete responses than securing the information through face-to-face interviews\u2014a pattern observed in the case of other types of sensitive information.  Given the increasing prevalence and popularity of web-based surveys, which are considerably less costly and provide more flexibility, the results are likely to be of relevance to any central bank considering conducting or already implementing a survey on household finances.\n\nOf course, in my brief tour, I have not even touched on the extensive regulatory data collections we undertake.  An exciting development in that area has been the creation of the Financial Stability Board Data Hub at the Bank for International Settlements, the result of extensive collaboration among central banks and banking supervisors in many countries.\n\nConclusion"

    "content": "It is a pleasure to be here today and to have the opportunity to talk about the role of economics and economists at the Reserve Banks.  Economics is a critical discipline at the New York Fed, just as it is at the Board of Governors and the other Reserve Banks. \n\nNevertheless, I expect that my perspective will differ a bit from that of Eric, Charlie, or Narayana1. In part, this is because my background is different.  Although I have a Ph.D. from Berkeley, unlike Charlie and Narayana, I never spent time in academia, and, unlike Eric, I spent most of my career not in public service, but working in the private sector.  My focus during my time in the private sector was also somewhat different than my colleagues, with an emphasis on those issues that affect financial markets. Don't get me wrong, I am very happy I got a Ph.D. in economics, the training has been invaluable.  It's just that my career path is a bit unusual relative to other central bankers, so that must influence my perspective. \n\nOf course, another important point of differentiation is where I am now and the unique role that the New York Fed performs within the Federal Reserve System.  All of the Federal Reserve Banks have their areas of specialization.  In my opinion, the New York Fed has at least four that are worthy of mention today because these affect the work of the New York Fed's economists. \n\nFirst, we are the operational arm of the Federal Reserve, responsible for the implementation of monetary policy.  This means we have a unique set of relationships with the securities dealer community and with respect to monitoring financial markets.  It also means that we work very closely with the Board of Governors and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in implementing monetary policy.  \n\nSecond, we have a unique endowment and responsibility by virtue of our location.  New York City is a global financial center, and finance is a very important aspect of the Second District's economy. Most of the largest global financial institutions have a major presence here.  With delegated authority from the Board of Governors, we are responsible for the supervision of most of the major financial institutions headquartered in our district, as well as numerous foreign banking organizations that do business here.\n\nThird, we are the fiscal agent for the Treasury and conduct the Treasury debt auctions on their behalf.  Additionally, we are responsible for Fedwire, which along with Clearing House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS), is one of the two large-dollar, real-time payment systems in the U.S. \n\nFourth, we have a unique set of international duties.  We provide banking services to foreign central banks, including investment of reserves and administration of foreign exchange swap lines.  We also have a seat at the table in Basel with respect to the activities of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), its various committees, and the Financial Stability Board (FSB).\n\nAs I noted earlier, economics is a critical discipline at the New York Fed.   The New York Fed economists are not just theoreticians.  Most have a strong empirical orientation and work very closely with those in the Bank that are responsible for the execution of policy\u2014be it with respect to monetary policy, financial stability, supervision or payments services.  What's special to me about the Bank is how the economists and non-economists work together to develop practical policy solutions to real-world problems and then implement those policies effectively.\n\nThe breadth of activities at the New York Fed means that our economists contribute to policy in many different ways, working closely with other areas of the Bank including those who execute on our supervision, monetary policy, and payments responsibilities.  We have about 60 Ph.D. economists in our Research Group.  But we also have many more in other areas of the Bank, such as part of our open markets desk, in our supervision group, and in our risk functions.  In fact, many of those with economics Ph.D.s elsewhere in the Bank started their careers at the Bank in the Research Group.  They moved to other areas of the Bank as their interests evolved and they became less focused on research and more focused on policy development.  This movement of economists throughout the organization has helped build a deep reservoir of human capital within the Bank and has fostered close collaboration between Research and other areas of the Bank. \n\nOur model with respect to attracting economists into our Research Group is to hire people with strong research skills, with the highest academic credentials and who already have or are likely to develop a policy orientation related to the Bank's work.  We give our economists plenty of time and opportunity to conduct independent research, and expect them to publish their research in the major academic journals and to engage with the economics profession outside the Bank.  As they progress in research capability, we require economists to apply the skills and techniques they use in research to policy issues.  We expect that, as their academic careers develop, there will be a natural convergence between their research interests and the Bank's policy agenda. This usually happens as a matter of course because the Bank has a rich agenda of policy issues to work on and the economists at the Bank often have unique access to data and information that would not be available elsewhere.  The convergence works in both directions: research informs the policy work and policy work generates research questions. The end result is that our economists have the ability to be both highly respected in their disciplines from a research perspective, and also to make a significant contribution to policy development and implementation.  There is an excellent value proposition both for the Bank and the economists that work here, as indicated by the publication record of our economists and their contribution to policy initiatives. \n\nLet me give you some more concrete examples of what our economists have worked on or are currently working on.  I will focus on three broad buckets: prudential policy and financial stability; monetary and macroeconomic policy; and microeconomic and regional economic policy.\n\nPrudential policy and financial stability\nNew York Fed economists, inside and outside our Research Group, provided substantial assistance to the design and development of the numerous emergency lender of last resort facilities implemented during the financial crisis.  This was done in conjunction with the Board of Governors, but the contributions from the New York Fed were critical because of our unique vantage point with respect to operational implementation, financial markets, and financial market infrastructures.\n\nIn a different vein, New York Fed economists assisted in designing, developing, and implementing supervisory stress testing, including the annual Comprehensive and Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) supervisory stress tests.  The New York Fed's economists perspectives and measurements on how downturns affect bank portfolio values was crucial to the design of these tests.  A critical aspect of CCAR was the development of independent detailed models for the key bank business lines to act as an independent check on the risk assessments by the banks. Of course, this effort also drew on work at the Board of Governors and the rest of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAs well, our economists have played a role in developing international and domestic regulatory policy with respect to bank capital and liquidity standards.  For instance, measurement of capital losses over time, and various run-off rates of different types of liabilities by our economists informed this work.  Also, our economists' work on broker-dealer liquidity informed the design of the liquidity coverage ratio. \n\nFinally, our economists pay special attention to the emerging area of financial stability monitoring.  This takes place in a number of realms, including participation in the work of the Basel Committees, such as the Committee on Global Financial Stability (CGFS) of the BIS, that I currently chair, and the Committee on Payments and Settlement Systems (CPSS), which I once chaired, the numerous workgroups and committees of the Financial Stability Board, and ongoing contributions to the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC).  With respect to the FSOC, for example, New York and Chicago Fed economists have played a key role in editing the FSOC annual reports.  \n\nA few other examples of our economists' involvement in prudential and regulator policy include:\n\nMonetary policy and macroeconomic policy\nEconomists provide invaluable input to the New York Fed President, who serves as Vice-Chairman of the FOMC, and to the Markets Group, which is responsible for the operational aspects of monetary policy implementation. \n\nThis work has many aspects, including: \n\nMicroeconomic and regional policy\nNew York Fed economists also have important opportunities supporting microeconomic and regional policy.  These include the survey of consumer expectations, which will launch this month, and the consumer credit panel, which, using raw data supplied by Equifax, allows us to develop insights into consumer indebtedness at the micro-level.  These panels give us and the public unique insights into household beliefs and behavior.  One example is the work highlighting the growing aggregate student loan debt balance and repayment burden.\n\nAn important responsibility for each of the Reserve Banks is coverage of economic development in its region. A significant aspect of this work at the New York Fed involves our regional press briefings, business surveys, and white papers.  One notable example has been the New York Fed economists' work in developing a white paper that highlighted some key choices that Puerto Rican policymakers might make to eliminate structural constraints that have impinged on the Island's economic performance. \n\nI'm very pleased by the contributions of our economists in the Bank, whether they sit in the Research Group or elsewhere in the Bank.  I think we have helped to contribute to the considerable progress made on a number of fronts, including making the financial system more resilient and robust and helping make monetary policy more effective, even at the zero lower bound.\n\nBut there is much more work to do.  In particular, I think we have just scratched the surface in understanding how developments in one area, such as capital and liquidity requirements for large, complex financial institutions, affect other areas, such as effective monetary policy implementation. We still don't have well developed macro-models that incorporate a realistic financial sector.  We don't understand fully how large-scale asset purchase programs work to ease financial market conditions\u2014is it the effect of the purchases on the portfolios of private investors, or alternatively is the major channel one of signaling? \n\nThere are many other riddles that remain to be solved.  How does one design an effective reference rate that is informative, verifiable and not vulnerable to manipulation?  If you manage to come up with one, how do you migrate the trillions of dollars of existing contracts to the new standard?  The U.S. unemployment rate has declined more sharply than one might expect given the economy's growth rate over the past few years.  Is this permanent or will it reverse if the economy continues to grow and the pressure on labor market resources increases in the coming years?   How does one end \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d for large global firms operating across different jurisdictions?  The list goes on and on.  There is plenty to work on and think about.\n\nFinally, let me take up one other question that Stan has posed: Do I think you need to be an economist to be the President at the New York Fed?  I don't think so.  If you look at the past five Presidents\u2014Volcker, Corrigan, McDonough, Geithner, and myself, some have been economists, some haven't.  Yet I think all my predecessors have been very effective. \n\nI think there are other attributes that are more important than being an economist: 1) An analytical orientation; 2) the ability to synthesize a broad range of material so as to understand the interactions of markets, financial institutions, and regulatory and macroeconomic policy; 3) open-mindedness and pragmatism\u2014the world is complicated and ever changing; and 4) the ability to lead\u2014that means identifying the key issues and motivating people to do their best work in order to develop new insights and approaches. \n\nHaving an economics background probably helps, especially on the analytics side, but, in my view, is by no means necessary and certainly not sufficient.  One point on which I am certain is that regardless of the background of the President, having a very strong research group is essential.\n\nThanks for your kind attention."
